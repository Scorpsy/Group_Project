I’ll admit today I bought a bunch of June 18 $125 calls. Already down like 3k on them, which sucks. I just don’t see how we can’t get a small bounce back to $120s in the near future. What do you guys think?",414,0.95

I wanna start by saying kudos to everyone who's holding their stocks!  
Been rough few months but let's all hope that the market comes back sooner than later.

Moving onto my question.... On top of my current portfolio, I've been holding cash aside for a while and I decided to put in another $10K into the market. I'm thinking to put it all into either DIS or AAPL to maximize the gain. I'm looking medium to long term, and I can wear through storms like this one or the COVID crash back in March 2020 as I don't need this cash any time soon. Since my portfolio is already tech heavy, I think DIS makes more sense but I wanted to run it through this sub and pick on your brains. 

Please feel free to share your thoughts! also on my portfolio as well. I won't take any of your inputs as financial advises and will make my own judgements. Thanks so much in advance.

I'm not stressing about it, as I feel they are solid companies, however I'm unsure what to do as (hopefully) they become a larger percentage of my portfolio.

They are in taxable, so trimming them now would create short gains, so I'd rather wait till they become long term.

Do I eventually trim them back to 5% each or do I trim less, to say 2.5% and let them build again to 5% or do I just let them keep growing in hopes that my other holdings catch up or outpace? Or does it really matter lol?",16,0.8

2020-12-29 15:03:13,Apple [AAPL] Stock Price Predictions | Buy or Sell AAPL? Apple [AAPL] Stock Price Target & Analysis,"**Should you buy Apple stock or has the company run out of growth opportunities? What is my price prediction for Apple in the next years? Read until the end as I reveal my price target for Apple and also what I think will happen in the next couple of days, weeks & months!**

**\~ Warning! Very Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone! So, let’s go over some of the latest news on Apple before moving on to some fundamental and technical analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock in the next years.

So, let’s start with the [news](https://postimg.cc/Xrkwk6rP) that Apple will cut the App Store commission in half for small app developers starting in the next days, this will affect developers who earn less than $1M annually from the App Store Sales. This is likely to lead to a small decline in commission revenues for Apple as around 98% of the app developers will qualify for this tax reduction from 30% to 15%, but all these small developers only contribute to about 5% of the estimated $50B in annual revenues from the App Store, so that would be only a $1.25B loss for the company, that is less than half a % of the company’s total net sales in the last fiscal year.

Also, these changes may lead to a potential long-term revenue boost, as it is likely this will lead to an increasing creation of apps which will generate more commissions in return.

Alongside this we also saw the company releasing the new MacBook’s with their first in-house [chip](https://postimg.cc/vc39NF7x), which promises faster video and imaging processing [times](https://postimg.cc/CR5Fmj5V), with both [CPU](https://postimg.cc/Y4yLdrMd) and [GPU](https://postimg.cc/xJz8gLsd) performance up to 2 times faster than the latest PC laptop chip using just a fraction of the power consumption, with both of the macbooks promising big improvements in [battery](https://postimg.cc/1fp6y1rz) life. Apple is also [expected](https://postimg.cc/GHrtJ8vc) to roll out even more in-house chips in future products, as they have started the 2-year breakup with Intel chips.

We also saw Morgan Stanley [upgrading](https://postimg.cc/bZ5qMsSS) their base case to $191 at the end of November, as they have cited record lead times, supply chain forecasts and carriers demand as they expect that the company will sell around 270M iPhone in fiscal year 2021, that’s 50M more than the consensus and almost 30M more than the previous estimate of Morgan Stanley, with an average selling price of 842$, 9% more than the base case, as people tend to chose the more expensive and high tech versions of the lineup in this new 5G cycle.

The 5G super-cycle, which I believe is on the way, and will continue in the next years, as 5G become more available worldwide, could still be the biggest thing coming right away for the company with 5G smartphones [expected](https://postimg.cc/LJptP88f) to surpass 4G sales by 2024, with the average sale price of the 5G phones also coming down, helping them become more popular. This will also be helped by the recent entry to the Indian [market](https://postimg.cc/7fV6BHNS), as India will probably become the world biggest country in the next decade, this could be a huge opportunity for Apple to start and take away market-share from their competitors like Samsung and Xiaomi which have the biggest market shares right now.

They also [released](https://postimg.cc/PpWhPy31) an update iPad Pro and an all-new iPad Air in September which will also boost sales in this work-from-home environment that will keep the demand very high for this kind of products, just like the Macs. Alongside the increasing demand from the Wearables, Home & Accessories that include Air Pods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, and many more products.

But the biggest reasons I believe Apple is poised for continued growth, is primarily due to its services business, as they start to offer more and more services like the Apple ONE [BUNDLE](https://postimg.cc/4777MD3s), which include up to 6 services from (Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, the new Apple Fitness+ and the iCloud service) for a pretty reasonable price in my opinion [starting](https://postimg.cc/BLkDnqzj) from 15$ up to 30$/month, this could be a great option for families and even individuals who use their services a lot.

The latest services, [Fitness+](https://postimg.cc/cKV4KrsG) just launched in the past days, and is a direct competitor to the likes of Peloton, as the service is available on the iPhone, iPad or even Apple TV. This also makes consumers buy the Apple Watch which syncs to the other devices to show you different information. The Fitness+ app just on its own is 8$/month or 80$/year which is less expensive than Peloton subscription which charges 13$ or even traditional gyms like Planet Fitness at 10$/month.

I think this will be the fastest growing sector for the company, as this aligns with the new macro trends, as the world is moving more and more to a digital approach to almost everything as consumer preferences, with more & more younger people reaching the point in life when they use these services start to align to this increasing digital approach.

We also shouldn’t forget the Apple Card & Apple Pay service among many others which also seem to gain from the move to digital & contactless payments, as this has been accelerated due to the current situation in the past year.

And one last piece of [news](https://postimg.cc/k6BKCVTr), and the most recent one, is that Apple may have fast-tracked the Titan project. The Titan project is targeting a 2024 or 2025 push to develop an electric vehicle with advanced battery technologies, that will deliver significant increases in range at much lower costs than the current technologies while also offering self-driving capabilities.

It’s reported they will not use the same technology as Tesla Full-Self-Driving feature, but will use LIDAR sensors, similar to those that we can find in the latest iPhone 12 PRO.

I think Apple can go 2 ways with this project, they can either use the huge amount of cash the company has to buy another car-maker like Ford, GM or any other car manufacturer expect Tesla and Toyota which do have a big market cap, so that they can fast-track the potential manufacturing of cars, or they can enter into a partnership with big companies like Tesla, Volkswagen or any other car marker to either produce cars or license their technology to this other car-makers which would ultimately and probably have higher margin-returns than the effective manufacturing of cars. Apple’s current overall [gross margins](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) stand at 38% vs the 15% average of the world top 10 automakers by market cap, which is significantly lower.

But this Apple Car thing is so far out, and there are so many unknowns, I will not try to predict anything related to this until there is more clarity on the subject.

And last, before moving on to some predictions, here are some of the highlights that we heard from the latest investors conference meeting, as the CEO, Tim Cook [expressed](https://postimg.cc/TyhpLzgg) optimism ahead with the launch of many new products and services, especially the Home Pod Mini and the new 5G iPhones, as these new iPhones include new LIDAR scanners that greatly improve the camera capabilities, as the iPhone as seen very positive reviews. We also saw the Senior VP and CFO, Luca Maestri give us great [outlook](https://postimg.cc/DWDmqxPD) for the company as they expect the installed devices base to continue to growth despite already being at an all-time high as they have over 585M paid subscriptions on their platforms and expect this to surpass 600M by the end of 2020.

I also researched and found what products we can see in the near future, with the first half of [2021](https://postimg.cc/jCBQsXVM) bringing new iMacs, the AirPods3 and the iPad Pro, while in the [FALL](https://postimg.cc/8jVJKngg) event we will probably get the new iPhone 13 alongside the iPhone SE PLUS and the Watch Series 7 with more products coming [later](https://postimg.cc/GHc3s01t) in 2021 or that don’t have an estimated release date like the Air Pods Pro, the Air Tags and the iPad Mini 6.

So, before even starting, you should know that I am bull on Apple but I am willing to hear other opinions so don’t be afraid to leave a comment down below.

I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the [company](https://postimg.cc/JHRDpPGQ), the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research.

This are my 2025 projections for Apple, let’s take a closer look at them, each on their own.

So, in term of revenues, Apple has 5 big sources of income, which saw an overall increase of 6% despite lagging sales in the iPhone. The biggest revenue is by far the iPhone right now with over $137B in revenue in the fiscal year ending in September. I expect to see the iPhone sales increasing in the next years, especially in 2021, with the new 5G iPhone creating a super-cycle for the [company](https://postimg.cc/XGfBKT7J), as most iPhone users, including myself here, as I will upgrade from my iPhone X, will switch to this new product. The iPhone sales have decreased in the last couple of years by 14% and 3% as a result of the product not having big improvements, as well as iPhone usually starting to last longer than previous models, so I expect to see a 12% increase in sales next year and a gradual decrease in the growth of sales as more people upgrade, ending with just a 5% growth in iPhone [sales](https://postimg.cc/V0wfRpr7) in 2025.

The next revenues stream is from the Mac, which has seen an increase in the past 2years, with revenues topping $28B this year after the huge demand from the work from home consumers. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/1405tm2b) this trend to continue as they plan to continue to launch better products and I can see the company having a similar growth next year before starting to decline slightly until 2025, also ending with a 5% growth.

The iPad is currently the smallest revenue stream for Apple but has also seen an increase in demand in the past 2 years with a 13% average increase in revenues. I also expect the iPad to continue to grow in the next couple of years, especially with the learn-from-home environment for kids, and even after this period ends, the transformation for learning will implicate more digital usage. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/5XKtVsT0) the iPad to see some similar growth to the Macs, especially with the latest generation also bringing a new iPad air to the market.

The 4th revenue stream and the fastest growing in the past 2 years, with an average growth of 33% are the wearables, home & accessories revenues. This have topped $30B this year, as Apple has also just launched the Apple Watch series 6 and also feature other great products like Apple TV, the Air Pods the Home Pod and the Home Pod mini alongside other third-party accessories.

I gave this [revenue](https://postimg.cc/v4C4JQ4T) stream a growth of 20% starting next year with a gradual decrease to around 8% by 2025, as I believe this will become more & more popular as they start to offer more vertical integration.

And last, but by no means least, the revenue stream that I expect to grow the most and the fastest is the revenue from the services that Apple offers. This includes revenues from Apple Care, Advertising, Cloud Services, Payment Services like Apple Card & Apple Pay and of course the digital content which includes fees from the App Store alongside subscription-based income including the new Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ alongside the already know Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+ and hopefully I don’t forget any others.

So, I [expect](https://postimg.cc/svV7mDWR) this to become the clear 2nd biggest revenue stream for Apple by 2025, as I expect this to grow more than 20% next year, mainly due to the Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ followed up by a slightly decreasing growth, ending with a 10% increase in revenues in 2025.

I think this are fairly conservative base case scenarios for the revenues, as I expect them to continue to increase the [other](https://postimg.cc/1VFFgkxJ) revenue streams and not have such a large percentage of the revenues coming from the iPhone sales as you can see in this chart.

In terms of expenses, I pretty much kept the same margins as in previous years, with a 68% expense ratio on product sales \[ [iPhone](https://postimg.cc/JDZ7jMnD) / [iPad](https://postimg.cc/Wd14CB9C) / [Mac](https://postimg.cc/q6GkZw2p) / [WHA](https://postimg.cc/211q9q8g) \] and 35% expense ratio on [SERVICES](https://postimg.cc/8sdLLrjH), as this are way more lucrative.

In the past 3 years, the products [gross margin](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) was 32.7%, so I actually imply bigger expenses for the manufacturing and sales of products, as this is mostly impacted by the company’s supplier’s ability to make up for and demand, while for the services revenue, the gross margins for the last 3 years has been 63.5% on average, but I expect this to be more in-line with the 66% margin in this past year. So, if services manage to grow to about half the revenues from the iPhone, this will effectively double the gross revenues, as every buck gained in the service revenues account for 2$ in the product sales.

So, I expect the total [revenues](https://postimg.cc/sMjByQ2n) for Apple to increase from $274B in 2020 to over $440B by 2025, increasing by approximately 10%/year, while I will keep the expense ratio pretty much in-line and have them increasing by 11%/year, this would bring the total gross income for Apple to $177B, increasing mainly due to the services revenues as I said earlier. This growth is just above the 4year [average](https://postimg.cc/Tp8g83mS), and below the 2018 levels, which we might see again with this 5G super-cycle and explosive growth in the services revenue.

I also think the company will continue to invest in both Capital Expenditure and Operating expenses.

I think the operating expenses will remain pretty much in line with the [previous](https://postimg.cc/2qBCfrnc) years, as this number has increased by 1% [annually](https://postimg.cc/Fd5JL9v8) both in R&D and SG&A. So, I will keep the exact percentages from previous years, as I expect the revenue to increase, thus I don’t see a big increase percentage wise. This would account for over $60B in operating expenses by 2025 and over $11B in Capital Expenditures by 2025, as I expect this to increase, mainly due to the possible EV developments or investments in self-driving capabilities alongside other manufacturing capabilities. You can see that the Capex [spending](https://postimg.cc/yDsRdpLy) has been decreasing in the past years with just over $8.8B in payments for business acquisitions and the other traditional Capex spending. Some people may use the cash generated by [investing](https://postimg.cc/Mn9nG6Mz) activities as Capex, but that is more unreliable. I also can see the Capex going back up, so I wanted to be safe and implied a 10% growth.

This money would account for over $73B in [expenses](https://postimg.cc/dZnY91K1) and would bring the profit for the company to almost $104B before interest and taxes.

Moving on, let’s see what interest income and expenses the [company](https://postimg.cc/cgy0x2ms) has had in the past few years. We can see a decrease in interest expense in the past few years as the company has been paying off debt, but they have also been generating less money in this department, with an overall decrease in this department of more than 50% in the past year, way less than the amount from 2018. So, for safety reasons, I used a 10% decline in both income and expenses [related](https://postimg.cc/QKgtZhZG) to interest, while increasing the other losses by 10%/year.

This would bring the company pre-tax income to just over $104B in 2025.

Let’s move on to taxes. I know the Federal income tax rate is 21% for the [company](https://postimg.cc/ykY39pq1), but the actual effective tax rate for the company was lower than 15% in the past year, mainly due to lower tax-rates on foreign earnings alongside tax-benefits and tax-settlements. The average effective tax rate has been just over 16% in the past 3 years, but with more and more of the revenues coming from outside the US, I think it’s safe to say that the company will have around a 15% effective tax rate by 2025, this obviously if nothing major changes in tax policy around the world.

So, Apple would [have](https://postimg.cc/Wqc3ytKw) $88.6B in income after tax by 2025 and with the current outstanding shares standing at just under 17B, so I don’t even account for the company probably continuing to do share buybacks, this would mean a $5.22 [future](https://postimg.cc/4YytCLwL) earnings/share. And with today’s price for Apple just around 136$, that would mean to [company](https://postimg.cc/RNf1qH44) is trading at just over 26 times forward price to earnings.

I don’t think Apple will ever trade at a discount again, with the current PE [standing](https://postimg.cc/RqwqHQ6s) at over 40, I believe this will eventually go down, probably to around 35, despite the increase in services revenue, which is highly valued by investors. I think we can see Apple trade somewhere near 35 [times](https://postimg.cc/5H98PKv2) P/E in 2025, especially if something big happens with the EV project, this could be even higher, just look at Tesla which trades at [insane](https://postimg.cc/sBZhxMk5) P/E. Of course, we also have to take into consideration the dividends that will be received from owning the stock, as Apple has started to pay dividends almost a decade ago and has 9 years of dividend growth, with a 10% annual rate of [growth](https://postimg.cc/CnbZMbD2) in the past 5 years. [Here](https://postimg.cc/7CLT1G8C) is the dividend growth history for the company, as I also went conservative on this [estimate](https://postimg.cc/Tp7LcjGr) and implied a 7% growth for the next 2 years, 6% for 2023 and 2024 and just 5% in 2025.

So [here](https://postimg.cc/R3PK21QQ) are my 3 price targets for the company, [including](https://postimg.cc/JHR8JXvv) dividends but not reinvested. My bear case scenario is that Apple will trade at almost 165$ which implies a [return](https://postimg.cc/jCYzWhd2) of over 21% by 2025, while my base case scenario would see Apple trading at 195$ with a return of capital of 43%. I will also make the bull case for Apple trading at 225$ by 2025 with dividends included, which would imply just over 65% in gains by then.

I think this is possible as Apple has also [continued](https://postimg.cc/fJj36jMt) to buy back shares of the company on a constant basis, as they continue to an impressive campaign with over $72B worth of common stock repurchased in 2020. They continue to buy back shares at a very fast pace, having repurchased over 1.3B shares in 2019 and 2018, while also issuing less stock every year.

So here is the full [spreadsheet](https://postimg.cc/Z995KrzL) that I have projected for Apple by 2025 and the breakdown of everything i estimated \[ [1](https://postimg.cc/jCT7qdZJ) / [2](https://postimg.cc/DmcbSkMp) \] , if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.

Keep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just [look](https://postimg.cc/V50nHCSn) at the growth Apple has had in the last 5years. The company has increased in value by more 400% in just the past 5years and is over 100.000% up since it started trading. So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company. So, are you willing to bet against Apple?

The company also has pristine [financials](https://postimg.cc/LYcYMxqf), with more than $65B in total assets compared to total liabilities, and more than $38B in cash and cash equivalents.

So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Apple?

Let’s look at this [CHART](https://postimg.cc/7592T1c8), so starting with the stock split, Apple saw a correction within the September stock market pullback, in a buy the news & sell the event, after a huge runup post-announcement of the stock split. The stock entered a consolidation period, and didn’t have any big catalysts, especially with new iPhone lineup not being included in the Q4 results due to the late launch. The stock found some levels of resistance near the $120 levels that it struggled to get past but acted also as support after breaking them just before the recent news of the possible EV developments or self-driving-features to be licensed to other car manufacturers. After that news the stock spiked and has now reached the previous highs made before the stock split and is facing some resistance, if the stock pushes over $140 I think we can officially say that it broke the resistance at those levels and is not just a fake-out. But I think it’s likely that the stock will consolidate between 122 and 135$ in the next weeks until the next iPhone sales and quarterly results are released, as the stock has entered overbought territory again with an RSI over 70, the first time since the stock split.

So, what would I do? Well, I own Apple stock, and I really believe this company will remain the biggest or one of the biggest in the future, so I would really add on any weakness that the stock shows before the next quarter earnings are released, as typically Q1 [earnings](https://postimg.cc/V5t0FPTF) are the best for the company due to increased holiday sales combined with the launch of new products. I think any entry below 130$ would be really nice to start and build a position or increase it if you already own the stock. As I believe Apple is one of the most stable stocks out there with large institutional [holders](https://postimg.cc/3kqG3XcK) like Vanguard, BlackRock and Berkshire owning over 900M shares each.

Looking at $AAPL in 2011 for a trend.","Hello internet, here's a little context to my request. If you want to get to the meat and potatoes of the request, skip this paragraph. I am a young lad who's getting a grip on his finances. I've decided to start investing, but my young age has me, well, inexperienced. I was planning on opening an brokerage account when I turned 18, but covid had majorly impacted my financial situation from what I had foreseen it to be. So, half a year later, here I am, motivated to start by the GME short squeeze. Having taken a (shortened) semester in highschool where I learned a little about stocks and investments, I've decided that since I'm young and not financially independent to invest in stocks I have a strong feeling are going to grow continually over the years. One of my first thoughts was Amazon, and so with the $20 I had before getting a job I invested about $10 of it into Amazon. 
That investment has since flopped, because as soon as I made the investment, Bezos decided to step down as CEO. actually, this move had been coming for a long time it seems based on a few reddit posts here, one of them dating back to 5 months ago. This experience has taught me to do more research before investing, a valuable lesson to learn. So, now that I have a part time job and nothing to spend the money on, I'm looking at expanding my portfolio. Particularly within my investments in Amazon. 

Even though the CEO transition has plummeted the stock, I firmly believe Andy Jassy will be a strong CEO and that Amazon will recover and begin to regrow. Now, my question is when. My first thought was to look at the history. When has a large tech company changed CEOs, and how long did it take for the stock to recover? So, I looked at Apple. then I got confused. from the looks of it, when Tim Cook took over as CEO of Apple, the stock didn't drop. Why? I'm hoping someone more experienced who might have been invested in Apple at the time could explain to me why the stock didn't drop. Was Steve Job's illness already bringing down Apple's stock growth, and so hearing of a new CEO actually boosted the stock because the public believed Tim Cook would make a good ceo? why isn't this the case with Andy Jassy, who from what I can gather has been the lead of Amazon's most profitable division practically since the beginning? What is the difference between these situations??? Or perhaps, maybe I'm looking at the Apple stock from too macro of a perspective? in which case, how micro do I have to go to see how long it took for their stock to stop dropping and go back up? Apple is only the first of businesses I want to look at who've had CEO transitions – as I know it's important to take multiple examples into consideration when looking for a historical trend – but it's leaving me stumped. I want to invest more into Amazon, but I want to do it at the right time. right now, $AMZN is at the one of the two lowest points it's been at over the last 6 months, and I expect that low to continue to dip, but I'm not sure how long. Any suggestions? Should I invest pieces at every small dip? If so, what percent of my investable money should I invest at each dip? this decision I would make based on the historical trend of stocks' behaviors following CEO shifts, but again, the one I'm looking at ($AAPL) seems to not... make sense. Maybe I should look to different companies for examples? if so, which ones? I'm young and haven't been around long enough to know what tech companies have done this besides Apple. I'm also unsure of what resources I could look into to help me figure out a trend. Anything an experienced investor could offer me would be tremendously appreciated.


TL;DR $AMZN has been dropping since Andy Jassy has taken over, presumably out of concern that he won't lead the company as successfully as Bezos did. Why didn't this concern apply to Tim Cook when he took over as CEO of Apple?  What other companies can I look at to get an idea of stocks' behaviors following a CEO transition?  I'm curious because I want to buy $AMZN at a low price, and so I want to ""see"" (guess/hypothesize) how long $AMZN will sink based on what history has shown. Of course, covid and stuff makes this a very unique situation too, so perhaps it's not even worth finding a historical trend? I'm new to investing and know that I should be investing safely and wisely, but I don't have the experience to determine what would be safe and wise.",8,0.84

2021-02-16 08:00:59,Weekly Stock Market News | TLRY / PLTR / TSLA / DIS / AAPL / GM & other Stock Market News [02-16],"**The stock market finished another great week at record highs. Investors turn even more bullish with semiconductors & pot skyrocketing. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of last week, as we saw all 3 major indexes finish at all time highs with the [Dow Jones](https://imgur.com/9QkK5ca) gaining 1% for the week, while the [SP500](https://imgur.com/o3g9vaq) rose by 1.2% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://imgur.com/TMdS1Ly) outperformed rising 1.7%, as 8 of the 11 [sectors](https://imgur.com/VejvtiI) finished the week with gains, with Utilities and Consumer Discretionary losing over 1%, but it’s important to note that the Volatility [Index](https://imgur.com/qFVLzd6) also closed at the lowest level in almost a year, as it closed under 20 on Friday.

[HERE](https://imgur.com/cvTchF7) is the HEAT MAP from last week, that shows pretty mixed results, with semiconductors & financials popping while the rest of the stock market had mixed results.

We also saw some interest economic data last week, as the TD Ameritrade January [Index](https://imgur.com/V78bPVC) came in at 6.91, up over 10% over December as most retail investors bought Apple, AMD & AT&T. The other interesting number that we received was the investor sentiment [survey](https://imgur.com/Pi3tk6d), which showed what I was expecting, as it came in with a more bullish view of the retail investors as I predicted last week, which is one thing to look at as a contrarian indicator, so right now, I’m not really adding anything to my portfolio, but I am still gathering some cash for the next correction/pullback.

In terms of Job numbers, we saw Job [Openings](https://imgur.com/URoCI4p) in December coming in slightly better than expectations as the job opening rate stood at 4.5% while the jobless [claims](https://imgur.com/Ouf4H1d) came in down almost 20k vs last week but was higher than expected by analyst as the number of continuing jobless claim grew by over 50K.

This [week](https://imgur.com/1foTccl) is pretty quiet in term of economic data, with only jobless claims and some preliminary numbers of the PMIs while on the [earnings](https://imgur.com/rySV2ud) front, we do have a couple of interesting ones left with names like Shopify, Fastly, Roku, Walmart, Fiverr & many others reporting.

In some other stock market news, we saw pot stocks torching the market towards new highs in the beginning of the week, only to [crumble](https://imgur.com/TNZOw4X) on Thursday, but still, most of the stocks managed to finish the week with very big gains. We can see that the [ETF](https://imgur.com/XgntUvu) for these stocks has crushed the markets and has almost doubled already this year. This hole spike started after Tilray announced an agreement with Grow Pharma for a [deal](https://imgur.com/TuznO0z) in the UK and of [course](https://imgur.com/21Lt9F2) the “chatter” on Reddit’s biggest stock market forum. And by the way, it’s still interesting to watch the Aphria/Tilray merger developments, to see if either Aphria spikes again, or if Tilray goes down to counteract the current 30% discount on the merger.

Meanwhile, despite popping on Monday after a [new](https://imgur.com/xwv5lEU) partnership with IBM which will be available starting in March, Palantir finished the week more than 5%, ahead of the Q4 earnings results that will be announced this morning, and should be interesting to watch if they sustain the huge rise of the stock in the past months. (Later edit: PLTR beat on revenue but posted an unexpected loss of $0.06/share)

We also saw numbers from Tesla’s China [sales](https://imgur.com/fc8gduC), which more than doubled in 2020 and now stand at 21% of their total sales at almost $7B, as the model 3 was the best-selling electric car in China in 2020. Tesla also slumped last [week](https://imgur.com/KNzzLHK), despite popping on Monday after the disclosure of $1.5B in digital currency assets bought in January, as more [analysts](https://imgur.com/eMxGtXU) are pointing to a potential battery cell supply shortage in the future for EV companies.

Regarding earnings reports, there were a couple of interesting one’s last week, with Disney [posting](https://imgur.com/4x7GFjt) a surprise profit of $0.32 and beating on revenues, as Disney+ subscribers are nearing the 100M mark, while the current total direct-to-consumer subs stand at 146M. This helped the company return to profitability after just one quarter of negative [results](https://imgur.com/kvEjJN3), which is incredible given the big hit taken by the rest of their revenue streams.

Apple also had an interesting week after [reports](https://imgur.com/wHUEKv9) that they are not in talks with Hyundai, Kia on developing a self-driving electric car, while JP Morgan [speculated](https://imgur.com/UX2MvzG) they might partner with Renault, and pointed to a couple of interesting things, like Renault’s 1million units of excess capacity, their track record with contract manufacturing and the flexibility this might give Apple to having a bigger input on the manufacturing process. It’s also to be noted that this could be a nice synergy for them, as Renault & Nissan have struggled with their EV products, so this could provide a big presence across key regions for both of the companies, while also offering premium products, as Apple pretty much stands for premium offerings. Though, it’s still very [unclear](https://imgur.com/IYjOfBX) which way Apple will go, but it’s pretty safe to say, they are definetly moving forward with this project.

Also, regarding earnings reports we did have a couple of interesting ones, as the recent green energy favorite, [Enphase](https://imgur.com/tvpnxk0) beat expectations by $0.11, as the stock popped on better-than-expected guidance for the next quarter.

We also saw [Twitter](https://imgur.com/KQb4ClB) beating expectations for the quarter on the top and bottom line, but disappointed on monetizable daily users which came in 1.5M lower than expected, though this didn’t stop the stock to pop to new highs at over $70.

Meanwhile, [GM](https://imgur.com/Yk0tdaK) also posted great beats on the earnings report as the company showcased an EBIT 20% beat than expected, but this didn’t help the stock as it sold off after the report that it may also be high be the global chip shortage, as this has made big companies like [NVIDIA](https://imgur.com/oVFjne0) to bring back older products to meet the insane demand for semiconductors.

One last piece of news for the week was that Qualcomm unveiled their [new](https://imgur.com/vrKYXlS) 5G modem to compete in this new 5G rush, while also [objecting](https://imgur.com/9epoJGz) to NVIDIA possible ARM acquisition, as this could possibly limit other chipmakers accessing the intellectual property possessed by ARM, as this is used in 95% of the world’s smartphones.

So, let’s hope for a good week in the stock markets again, as we have to keep an eye on what big companies like Walmart & Shopify announce later in the week.

2021-01-13 04:54:05,Stock Market News for Today | PLUG Power & GM | TSLA vs AAPL| AFRM & other Stock Market News [01-13],"**Big tech struggles as small-caps continue to overperform. Plug Power rises on Renault venture while GM reveals flying car. Is Tesla going to crush Apple? Let’s talk about this & other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market posting small gains, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/V2Yn5xJ) leading the way, up .28%, the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/hMpFmmF) gaining 60 points and the [SP500](https://ibb.co/YLYfs4V) finishing flat for the day, just about 3800, while the [VIX](https://ibb.co/sgR88nB) posted a 3% decline, though it seemed it was going to go back into higher volatility territory in the middle of the day

We also saw almost 70% of [companies](https://ibb.co/vHBQThL) advancing with 260 new highs on about average volume as 6 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/7pwD88M) finished in the green, with Energy leading the way yet again & continuing to outperform in 2021, while Health Care and Communications lost more than 1%, with Large-Cap Growth Companies being the biggest laggard, also continuing the huge underperformance compared to all other factors, as small & mid-caps have largely [outperformed](https://ibb.co/QH694Vc) since the start of the year.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/2Kt4ChR) from yesterday, with most big tech companies losing ground, though Tesla did recover after an 8% plunge on Monday and was also joined by the Banks, the Semiconductors and the Oil & Gas companies.

Yesterday we also got some economic data, with the Small Business Optimism [INDEX](https://ibb.co/12TgvbS) falling sharply to 95.9 in December, vs the 102 expected and 101.4 in the previous month, as the small business optimism has continued to drop after the highs it made in September, while job [OPENINGS](https://ibb.co/S0VG5PZ) came pretty much in line with the previous report at 6.52M, as the openings rate remained double the quits rate. And in some better news we saw the worldwide semiconductor [MARKET](https://ibb.co/8NZ79p7) gaining 7% year over year to reach $39.4B for November, as the world will keep on needing more & more semiconductors with improving technology, I really like this sector and I believe it’s one of the best for long-term investing.

[Today](https://ibb.co/s3c5sMQ) we start the day off with the MBA Mortgage Applications, Consumer Price Index and finish the day with the Treasury Budget and the FED’s Beige Book.

While in the IPO world, we will see [AFFIRM](https://ibb.co/6WqTmZX) start trading today, as the company set the final IPO price at $49 way above the first and second ranges between 33-44$. I really am interested in this company thought it’s unlikely we will see shares available to retail traders under 60-70$ in my opinion, while in the M&A department, we saw [VISA](https://ibb.co/CVkG87d) terminate the merger agreement with Plaid a year after the first announcement of the proposed transaction.

In some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/VBYhdY1), we saw Boeing land a $1.7B Air Force contract. This is good news for Boeing, as the commercial airlines business will be struggling at least for a couple of years until they ramp up the MAX production & airline traffic demand goes back close to the levels seen before 2020, which might happen with more easily scalable vaccines coming soon from the likes of [JNJ](https://ibb.co/VCpS3Kw), while they also did suffer another hit with a plane crash in Asia, though it’s not expected to be from a manufacturing defect, but [RATHER](https://ibb.co/Y2TZtNK) by the lax maintenance in the 9months the airplane was grounded last year.

We also saw Plug Power [skyrocket](https://ibb.co/3yChM7R) yet again, finishing the day up over 20% after the announcement of a hydrogen venture with Renault. This joint venture is [expected](https://ibb.co/LhFHnrX) to lead to further developments in fuel cell & hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, that will be based on Renaults platforms, as the companies will combine the manufacturing capabilities of the OEM with the fuel cell & hydrogen system knowledge from Plug Power. It’s expected they will also provide refueling stations to help the ecosystem, in an effort to offer vertical integration with vehicles, fueling stations, services & selling hydrogen fuel to customers. It’s seems a good & interesting development, but I would avoid buying it after such a huge [SPIKE](https://ibb.co/WkGwC79), it should have somewhat of a small pullback sometime soon.

In the Automobile world we also saw GM making a big splash at CES, with announcements of a big [PUSH](https://ibb.co/swv4wn3) into electric vans, a new Venture called BrightDrop that will develop even more electric-powered machinery and the surprise reveal of a [FLYING](https://ibb.co/G5bP3YX) Cadillac, while [TESLA](https://ibb.co/W2H1xrc) just registered its Indian entity just as ARK’s Invest CEO [NOTED](https://ibb.co/qWjZqmF) that Tesla is still way ahead of Apple by taking a page from their own playbook when developing their own chips for the autonomous vehicles. I personally believe that there is enough room for both companies to exist in this new EV path by mostly crushing other traditional OEMs which aren’t good enough at adopting this new trend like Nissan & others.

We also saw Walmart adding even more news on the back of the [FINTECH](https://ibb.co/DVKSgGb) startup, as they are also planning on experimenting with even [MORE](https://ibb.co/g7qgstZ) delivery options, as the company seems to be trying to innovate as much as possible to increase the efficiency, as they try to compete as much as possible with online-purpose [RETAILERS](https://ibb.co/YjMjDLw) that are high flying yet again.

And one last piece of [NEWS](https://ibb.co/zQBd1L5), is that we saw a report that suggests the iPhone 12 sold 18M units in China in the last quarter of 2020, exceeding all expectations and more than doubling their market share from 10% to over 20%, thus delivering a hit to Asian manufacturers of smartphones. This is exactly what I expected as the new iPhone 12 lineup should be a hit around the world, with many loyal Apple brand followers switching to the 5G technology and to the better camera capabilities. This will also help Apple increase the services business revenue streams, as an increased devices base will lead to increased services usage.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as both the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/HB5P34r) Markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/BgwpqT8) are mixed, with the Nasdaq posting to a small open gain.

Even though apple is the biggest company right now, thinking long term 10-15 years from now. I actually think when its all set and done, I see AMZN and MSFT to be WAY bigger companies than AAPL. Because they have shown risk taking and investing in other companies and successfully vertically integrating that in their business model

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw all 3 big indexes closing the day in the red despite hitting intraday records, with the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/PCN8dwz) losing .38%, while both the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/cDjpNKP) and the [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/RydQj61) Industrial finished the day down just over .2% as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/44wGzR0) rising by more than 4% yesterday as the $2000 stimulus was [BLOCKED](https://ibb.co/WFNSpCH) in the Senate by McConnell and the Georgia Senate runoff election is just a week away.

Almost 70% of the [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/LYM4JfL) were declining yesterday on below average volume as the number of companies that were trading above the 50-day moving average fell under 70% for the first time in quite a while.

We saw 9 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/GRJSmht) closing in the red yesterday, with only the Health Care and Consumer Discretionary sectors having small gains as almost all the types of companies were losing ground [YESTERDAY](https://ibb.co/7tKPyP4), especially the small-caps with the small-cap growth group losing more than 2%.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/KjVsn9X) from yesterday, it’s mostly red, with only a couple of companies that were gaining big like the Chinese companies alongside Amazon and Intel.HEAT

We also got some economic data yesterday, as a review of the 2020 aviation and air travel [ESTIMATED](https://ibb.co/hRbYxpG) that traffic will be down 67% since last year, dropping to levels not seen since 1999, as air travel is still struggling to come back after the march bottoms. This has affected most of the [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/FBq4g37) worldwide but it seems that China airlines is doing somewhat better with the biggest percentage of the total number of flights completed compared to last year.

The SP Home price [INDICES](https://ibb.co/W67RBYh) also came in better than expected with the National Index increasing by 1.4% M/M, as this is a leading measure of real estate prices, gaining 8.4% nationwide over year ago. 

These moves can also be seen in the latest Redfin report, as home sales [PRICES](https://ibb.co/CwR5H56) are up 14% year/year to over $320K with a great increase in pending [SALES](https://ibb.co/mJtrwV9) which are also up more than 34% since last year, as the number of active [LISTINGS](https://ibb.co/vVkfMMh) of home sales is down more than 30%, as buyers can’t snatch them up quick enough with such low [YIELDS](https://ibb.co/7j1kY3s), as this has led for the [AVERAGE](https://ibb.co/gzQq8Wb) sale price to list value to rise to 99.4% which Is up 1.5% since 2019. This should be good news for companies like Toll Brothers, Lennar, HD and LOW.

This was also accompanied by the great numbers in the us chain store sales [NUMBERS](https://ibb.co/4PykPcH), which rose by almost 9% y/y with December sales expected to rise almost 5% since last year and a .2% increase since last month.

While [TODAY](https://ibb.co/8N3YMPV) we start the day with MBA Mortgage applications, home sales and the Chicago PMI alongside advance reads on many other data points.

In some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/q1J6Snv), we saw Apple cool of a little yesterday, losing more than 1% for the day while they also lost a lawsuit aimed of stopping Corellium using virtual iPhone for security researching in the operating system, while [INTEL](https://ibb.co/3vvXFGT) finally got a breather and recovered some of the recent loses, after an activist hedge fund manager pushed for strategic changes in the company as Intel is losing market share and top designers, with the company also [ISSUING](https://ibb.co/WgtwTrY) a statement that lifted spirits around the stock.

We also saw the [FAA](https://ibb.co/6rJ6bHd) introduce new rules for drones, this may have a big impact on companies like UPS, Walmart and Amazon, as all of them have started trials for drone-delivery, as this could lead to better margins for the companies.

The Fed also [EXTENDED](https://ibb.co/cxV3HkC) the main street lending programs until Jan. 8 with the approval of Mnuchin as they try to process a bunch of applications this month, this means we can get even more money put into the economy and eventually the stock markets which is good news.

And meanwhile, AstraZeneca’s vaccine was [APPROVED](https://ibb.co/y5QWbmh) for emergency use in the UK, this is another weapon to find this freaking illness, while JNJ will give us some results in early 2021 and Novavax just started their trial in the US.

Also, one last piece of data that I found recently shows that there was indeed a huge spike this [YEAR](https://ibb.co/JrKw01B) in the move to live streaming video and pre-recorded videos this year, as this has boosted companies like Peloton, Lululemon and others.

But this trend is seen slowing down in the next years with just a 4% [CAGR](https://ibb.co/HGhFJXS) in the equipment market, but that the exercise apps will see a big [GROWTH](https://ibb.co/02wm273) in the next years, so there are 2 different POV. I wouldn’t stay invested in companies like PTON right now, I’d rather take profits and move to other areas in the stock market. But don’t rush into companies like AMC which have diluted their stock a lot or have lots of debt… this will not recover so fast, with [AMC](https://ibb.co/gDR8S81) filling to share up to 50M shares.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/nbV49Bs) seem to be pointing at a good open, with all 3 big indexes in the green as the Nasdaq is leading the way.

So to start this off I'll admit that I dived straight in with no prior knowledge of investing with GME, AMC and the most stupid, a little bit of Dogecoin. I'm still hoping AMC will recover at least a little when theatres re-open as I bought at $15 lol. I sold half my $400 GME off early (bought at $320) for about $10 profit or something tiny. I still have $200 and I'm still holding on. I'm aware that this might not be wise but luckily, the one non-stupid thing I did with this is that I used a certain percentage of my profits from beermoney ventures (surveys, market research and the like) as well as my matched betting which means, that whilst it was stupid and it is frustrating to lose both my own money and potential profit due to my own lack of research, I haven't risked anything I couldn't afford to lose.

I'm getting older and busier so I don't always have time to be answering long and boring surveys anymore so I wanted to take the percentage of these profits and invest in relatively long term stocks. I've been doing some research and have purchased a couple of books and I've been looking into a variety of different stocks to start my portfolio. It's worth mentioning that I only have roughly $400-$500 to invest.

These are the shares I'm thinking/have already invested in:

**NVAX:**

Currently, I have $50 that I got at $211.91 a share in NVAX. For those who don't know NVAX recently developed a Coronavirus vaccine that is 89% effective, whilst this is less than Pfizer and Moderna, Pfizer and Moderna are not backed up by clinical trials and most importantly, NVAX was 89% effective against both the original and the new mutated Coronavirus. I think this will do quite well.


**AAPL:**

This is where the stocks I have end. AAPL is currenly at $135 which seems quite low and despite COVID, it has done really well financially. There is also mentioning of the Apple Car, Apple VR a new computer and it's increase in iPhone users this/last year. It seems like an obvious purchase but this is definitely where my lack of knowledge comes in. There have been all this stuff, huge revenues, new products and it's debt deal, yet over the past few days it's kinda stayed between $130 - $140 so I'm a bit uncertain on this one.

**FUBO:**

This seems like it could do very well and there's loose speculation of it being worth $200 by the end of the year. That being said, the subscription revenue isn't particularly long-term, but then, they do have a new betting service. They report earnings on March 2. I was thinking of putting in a sell order at around at some price between $40-$50 but I'm very clearly not an expert so was hoping someone might have better insight. I'm thinking that personally, this is too risky for me either way but would be nice to hear some insight so I can learn what to look out for.

**SQ**:

There was a bit of a dip in Square. They seem to be fundamentally quite strong since they cater to non-cash payments and for obvious reasons right now that seems pretty good. I think more importantly though, I don't want to go on about it but obviously a certain couple apps are in trouble and since CashApp now offers investing for a very similar user base it might increase. Like Apple this one seems obvious but then it's currently at $227. A optimistic look from investopedia says it'll go back up to $300. I assume there's a bit of a risk with that so with the risk and the fact that the optimistic increase would be from \~$230 to $300 I feel that now I might be a bit late.

This is the end of a very long post and thanks for reading it. I understand that it's impossible to say you should go with this stock as it's 100% going to profit but I think some tips with these stocks that I mentioned and I guess just general advice for things to look for that I may have missed in my small analyses. I find that for some reason, I'm always reluctant to invest in the big'uns like Tesla, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft as in my head they're just expensive shares that don't change much which is obviously untrue and probably a mindset of an inexperienced investor. Also, I'm aware that even over the span of a few years £400 might not necessarily make me lots but I'm using this time to come to grips with it more so that when I have a bigger income I'm more experienced. Also, I feel it's worth adding that I am a computer science and electronics student and I imagine investing in things you know/are interested in is always a good thing but I don't really know how to start with just finding a good company to invest in that isn't at least being mentioned a little.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Just wanted to update this with; I have been looking through Investopedia University, Khan Academy and have started reading Intelligent Investor. I just want to hopefully make it clear that on top of this post I am doing my own research and I hope people know that I'm not trying to just copy their decisions without any thought.

SO Apple. Why is Apple at ~$135 a stock when other big retail companies like their biggest competitor Samsung are WAY higher. Even google is 10x higher. Does it have to do with number of stocks available? Or the fact they just launched new tech (M1 chip) last year and likely won’t have a big release soon?

The lack of fiscal first-quarter 2021 guidance from Apple means that investors and analysts don’t get a hint at how Apple is projecting the sales performance of the iPhone 12, which went on sale in October. 


Apple stock dropped over 4% in extended trading.

“If you look at the case count, the case counts are climbing in Western Europe. They’re climbing in the United States. And so there’s still a sufficient level of uncertainty out there… we don’t believe that’s an environment to guide into,” Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Josh Lipton. 

Apple hasn’t offered guidance for the past two quarters because of uncertainty related to the Covid-19 pandemic. 

However, Cook said that he was optimistic about iPhone 12 sales for a number of reasons, including 5G support, carrier promotions, and a loyal install base, and said that “initial data points are really quite good.”

iPhone revenue was down over 16% from the same quarter last year and came up short against Wall street expectations. However, many investors and analysts are more focused on how the iPhone 12 will sell in the coming year. Apple’s iPhones went on sale this year in October, and more models are planned for next month, meaning that sales from the new devices aren’t counted in this quarter.

Revenue for Macs and iPads both exceeded analyst expectations, most likely driven by strong work-from-home trends during the pandemic. Apple drew attention to strong results in those categories last quarter, too. Overall, Mac revenue was up 29% year-over-year and iPad revenue rose 46% from the same quarter last year. 

Sales in China were a weak point for Apple. Sales in greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, dropped to $7.95 billion from $11.13 billion a year before, over a 28% decrease.

“A larger percentage of China revenue is made up of new iPhones. And so that’s the reason the number for the total quarter started with a minus sign. But given what we see in the early going with the new iPhones, we’re confident we’ll grow in Q1,” Cook told CNBC.

Apple released new Apple Watch Series 6 models that went on sale in September. The category that those devices are counted in for sales is called Wearables, Home, and Accessories, which came in slightly higher than expectations. The category also includes sales from headphones such as AirPods and Beats. Sales for the category were up over 20% on a year-over-year basis. 

Investors are always closely examining Apple’s services business, which includes subscriptions like iCloud and Apple Music, fees from the App Store paid by app developers, and licensing revenue. Services revenue exceeded Wall Street expectations and grew 16% over last year. 

On Friday, Apple will release bundles of its subscription services called Apple One, Reuters reported. The bundles vary by region but include Apple Music, iCloud storage, and Apple TV+ streaming video.",759,0.96
2021-01-24 18:58:00,AAPL price run up to earnings- likely to fall next week ?,"Anecdotally, I’ve noticed when a stock has an insane run up until earnings, any good news (or especially lackluster news) has already been baked into the price (think: Tesla battery day). When a stock doesn’t run up until the earnings it takes just a little positive news to move it up (Netflix last week). 

AAPL had an insane run up last week. I sold covered calls at 138 and aapl is 140 right now. I’ve never seen AAPL move this much in a week. I hold a leap as my underlying so I will continue to lose (1-delta of long) for for every additional dollar it goes over the sold calls. I’ll probably hold until the end of the week to see what happens but curious: 

Does anyone have any data showing what happens to companies during earnings when they’ve had run-ups prior to them? Conversely, when they were stagnant up until earnings and the company announced they beat earnings?

   1. Let me know if I'm thinking about this the wrong way?

With the news I’m wondering if I should hold past my percentage with the hopes the announcement that the deal is official, or if I should stick to my guns and sell when I hit my mark.

2021-01-25 05:04:35,Stock Market News for Today | PLTR / GM / AAPL / TSLA / FB / MSFT & Other Stock Market News [01-25],"**Stocks close out the week with big gains as Big Tech comes back in flavor. The earnings frenzy starts with Apple, Tesla, Facebook & Microsoft reporting. GameStop, GM & Ford spiked last week, let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of Friday as we saw most of the stock market giving up some of the big gains of the week, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/ZxdGSkm) losing .30% & the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/MRn5Q40) Industrial dropping 179 points while the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/F3wm2d8) barely managed to post a small gain for the day as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/JRkwsZn) ticking up a little but finishing under 22 for the week, with the Nasdaq gaining 4.2% in the short week the SP500 rising 1.9% and the Dow Jones posting a .6% gain.

About 55% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/hFF1hSm) were advancing on below average volume as the number of companies moving above the moving averages still remains very high. We only saw 3 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/pPJpQCk) posting small gains for the day while the biggest losers were the value play in Financials, Energy and Industrials, all losing more than .50%

For the week we saw communications outperform with a big spike after Netflix reported earnings, while Energy had more than one ugly day dropping big on Monday, Thursday and Friday.

Small-caps faired better to close out the [week](https://ibb.co/y0C39gJ), with all 3 groups posting gains of more than 1.5% while Large-Cap Value companies underperformed losing more than 2.5% for the week, as Growth Companies & Especially the big-caps finally outperformed this week, gaining 2.3%.

Here is the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/MnWSRV4), which was a pretty mixed bag, with Apple posting a big gain ahead of the earnings report while the other big tech companies also posted small-gains. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/BfYRHWS) though, we saw huge gains in most of the big tech names with all the FAANG names and Microsoft gaining more than 5% for the week, while Banks alongside Oil & Gas companies were the biggest losers

We also got some economic data on Friday as existing home [sales](https://ibb.co/KWxRW9m) rose again while the inventory is still at all time-lows of under 2 months of supply while the January [PMI](https://ibb.co/x54dqCy) current read came in at 58, way above the 55.5 expected and 55.3 in the previous read as both the Services and Manufacturing PMI saw a spike of more than 2 points

This week we also start the [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/2nsRvBx) frenzy, with AMD which might benefit from Intel’s drop last week, Microsoft & Starbucks reporting after Tuesday’s close as JNJ might also give some updates regarding their vaccine, while big value companies like Boeing, AT&T & Caterpillar report before the open on Wednesday & Friday. We also have some of the big tech names reporting on the same day, with Apple which is expected to have their first $100B quarter, Tesla & Facebook reporting after Wednesday’s close which might be a bigger volatility moment for the market depending on how the results come in.

In terms of economic [data](https://ibb.co/Fx6TWyw), we start off [today](https://ibb.co/4K4DDvp) with the Dallas FED Manufacturing survey but the most interesting ones are on Thursday & Friday, while we also wait to see what the FED announces in terms keeping the rates low & the money printer going with asset buying on Wednesday.

In some other stock market, we saw [Palantir](https://ibb.co/zV2vxft) soar on Friday, rising more than 25% to break the $30 levels after they updated their Demo Day scheduled for tomorrow. It’s expected that they will reveal the latest developments in their big software platforms and also reveal [new](https://ibb.co/swYH61R) software platforms that will continue to help the company grow such as SDDI, Low-Code/No-Code and other modular strategy software.

We also saw [Ford](https://ibb.co/D8cmmZn) soaring again, as the company is having the best monthly performance in more than 10 years and spiked more than 6% after JP Morgan upgraded the company based on their new product line which is what I’ve been saying about the company in some months now. Tesla is going to face serious competition in the next decade with all the other car manufactures pushing harder and harder into the EV world, with some of the most popular cars out there like the F150, the Bronco and other models joining the sector that will continue to improve and might actually become a good alternative to Tesla’s models. It’s the same with others like [GM](https://ibb.co/42G3ttK) which might be a good catch-up play compared to Tesla. By the way… [GM](https://ibb.co/vPwbPCs) is outperforming Tesla recently based on their developments in the EV & self-driving sector.

Meanwhile, [GME](https://ibb.co/bXYsj4k) had a wild day on Friday, gaining more than 50% despite being even higher as the battle between WSB & the shorts continues, with this move making Citron’s Left deciding to avoid further talks about the company probably in an attempt to avoid future attention at the GameStop short squeeze. Short Squeeze has seen a big rise in terms of [search](https://ibb.co/qn51BPH) interest after these latest moves in the GameStop stock and might even put more pressure on the bears, as retail investors might pump up this stock even more.

So, guys, this week might bring a lot of volatility depending on many of the important events we have. Earnings seasons & especially big tech results will be important to justify these high multiples most of the tech names have received, while we also have to see how the GDP comes in, as it is expected to have seen a 4% growth for the 4th quarter while the FED is under pressure to keep the money printer on and the rates low, if not, or if there is any doubt in their commitments and also some numbers come in worse than expected we might see the long-awaited correction/pullback. But I don’t think numbers or the FED are going to disappoint really, but that doesn’t exclude the possibility of the pullback… keep investing safely & have some money available to buy the dips if they appear, use them as a buying opportunity, not a panic sell.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/929L2rz) are pointing to a very good open, with the Nasdaq leading the way up almost 1%

2021-01-20 12:20:48,AAPL is planning a new ad-free podcasting subscription service to increase podcaster revenue. This could force SPOT’s hand to follow suit,"Good morning sun, good morning trees, good morning Apple...which is reportedly planning a new ad-free podcasting subscription service. 

Right now, podcasts are an adman’s game: Spotify and other top companies in the space, like Amazon and SiriusXM, spent the past few years “swallow[ing] up podcasting production firms in an effort to gain more control of the podcast ad market,” per The Information. 

Think: Stitcher, The Ringer, etc. 

Come back later: It could be bad timing for Spotify, which recently saw shares decline after analysts at Citi downgraded its stock because Spotify hasn’t shown “‘any material benefit’…from its $800 million-plus investment in podcasting content and tech,” per Variety. 

And, in theory, a major subscription service has the potential to yield more money for creators than the ads keeping them afloat now. 

Why it matters: This isn't the first ad-free subscription podcasting service, but Apple's deep pockets give it a better shot at disruption than smaller upstarts (looking at you, Luminary).

If Apple was to introduce their own search engine, this practice would obviously cease. For almost anyone else, it would be laughable to try and compete with Google’s search engine, but we are talking about a company with more cash than any other, ever. They could afford it and if they were successful, the ad revenue would become a significant part of their business. The linked article shows ample evidence that Apple is moving towards launching a search engine offering. Has this been factored into Apple and Google’s stock price? Given Apple recently hit $125 a share and is now at $115 ($116 after hours), it could represent a very good entry point to take advantage of this being introduced in 2021.

When looking at different historical data, 10d vs 3m charts, if I don't change the interval on RSI or MACD or Bollinger Bands, why do I get different appearing grafts? 

Specifically when I am looking at AAPL (a company with obviously good fundamentals, so it takes that question out). On a 10d chart looking 60 minute intervals it's trading at the bottom of it's Bollinger Bands with a MACD that looks like it's about to hit a buy signal and a bottom floor RSI. All of this to me says pick some AAPL up ASAP. 

However, when I change to a 3m chart, daily intervals, without changing the indicator settings, then it looks like MACD and RSI are still trending down and I interpret that as possibly needing to wait longer to buy (specifically the MACD given the increasing negative histogram). 

Am I just a total NOOB not understanding something? Is this just a limitation of the indicators? Am I improperly using them? Thanks so much for your guys help and I'm learning a ton from reading this sub.

**So what are the Fundamental characteristics of a TML? You want to see superior:**

* Quarterly Sales Growth > 25% YoY
* Quarterly Earnings Growth > 25% YoY
* Pre+After Tax Margins >20% Recent Quarters
* ROE >17%
* Annual Earnings Ests for the next year > 25%

And above all else you want the stock to have a great story- A new and innovative product or service  that changes how we work live or play. Not every TML will have all of these criteria, but in general their record should be outstanding with regards to most of them. The higher these values the better. Earnings and Sales growth over 100% YoY is ideal. Annual Estimates for next year over 100% would be exceptional.

TMLs are also often in the Top 20 Industry groups at the times of their runs. The TML is the leader of an overall top group which is riding the tailwinds of changing environments. Recent examples $SE $SHOP $AMZN Retail-Internet and $TSLA $NIO Electric Vehicles (Auto Manufacturers)

Additionally base liquidity is required for these stocks to be institutional quality. Dollar Volume > $30 Million is essential and most should have DV much higher than that. Accumulation by big hedge funds and mutual funds like Fidelity Contrafund are what move the markets. They won't touch a promising stock unless it has liquidity.

**Now for Technical (Price Action) Characteristics of TMLs.**

They should be:

* Above a Rising 30 Week Moving Average
* Breaking out of a Stage 1 or Stage 2 Base
* Trending above Key Moving Averages (10, 21ema, 50sma)
* Volume and Price contractions within bases
* Up/Down Vol> 1.2
* Huge gaps up on volume after Earning Beat
* And most importantly they must be showing Relative Strength, meaning they are outperforming the vast majority of stocks in the market. This. is. vital.

During corrections and overall market weakness they should be near all time highs, above their longer term moving averages.  They should be standing out like a sore thumb and yelling ""Buy me"".  And during Market Uptrends they should be trending above the shorter term moving averages, forming sideways price shelfs during small pullbacks and then breaking out again. Most stay above their 50 SMAs and even 21 emas for extended periods of time.

**So how to scan for them:**

Use MarketSmith, the IBD Stock Screener, Finviz, or another screener and screen for the fundamental criteria mentioned above combined with the stock over the 200+50 SMA.  It's helpful to have multiple screens splitting up the criteria for instance one scan for the earnings and one for sales.

What are the latest market movements in the auto industry? Pot get legalized in Mexico while FuboTv Plunges yet again. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning!

First of all, I wanted to wish everyone a happy new year and hopefully things get better in 2021, and this also brings us at least the great returns that we had in 2020 in the stock market!

So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw all 3 big indexes finish the last full trading day of the year in the green, with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/0cvjjHN) leading the way, up .24% and closing at a new record high, while both the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/QFyd2f6) and the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/B67fT1g) were up just over .1% for the day.

We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/b6Nqf9Z) barely drop yesterday closing just below 23, and with the Georgia runoff election just days away, we can see this going higher if the Democrats win both seats.

We saw almost 70% of the companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/g9CHK9Q) with most of them trading way below average volume as 7 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/LzXDF2P) finished in the green, with Energy & Materials closing the day up more than 1.3% while the biggest loser was the Communications sector, falling almost 0.7%, as we saw the small-cap stocks regain some momentum, [leading](https://ibb.co/yQCFtTZ) the way after they had 2 very bad days to start the week, while the only group that was losing ground yesterday was the large-cap growth sector.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/x5bN7Lk) from yesterday that pretty much sums up the other charts as we can see most big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft and even Apple losing ground for the day, while the biggest gainers were companies like Tesla & TSM alongside the industrial sector and companies like Disney and Mastercard.

Yesterday we also got the investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/7QPXjPV), which for me personally came in pretty mixed, as I use this as a contrarian indicator. This last week we saw 2.5% more investors moving to the bull’s camp, while we also saw almost a 5% increase in bears, as investors become more divided. I think the market is still a little to over bullish and I would avoid to add more money right now, but I wouldn’t get of the stock market either. I think this is a good moment to stay put and wait for more developments overall, but there might still be some good opportunities around in the market and I wouldn’t avoid getting into those.

We also got a lot of economic data yesterday, with a survey for business uncertainty for [December](https://ibb.co/87FMyQ6) showing increasing uncertainty for sales growth but a with a small decline in employment growth expectations.

Meanwhile another number that confirms the investor sentiment survey is the Investor Confidence [Index](https://ibb.co/5952C9Z) which rose by more than 13 points in November, as investors increased the risk appetite for their portfolios.

Alongside this we also saw the November pending home [SALES](https://ibb.co/F8WBXnh) decrease by more than 2.5% month over month, but are still up more than 16% since a year ago, with this monthly decrease mostly coming due to the shortage of inventory.

The Chicago [PMI](https://ibb.co/QF40My3) also came in way better than expected and 59.5 vs 57 expected and up from the 58.2 in the previous month with the biggest movement coming from the employment indicator as it rose to a one year high but is still in contraction territory since 2019.

We also saw the wholesale [inventories](https://ibb.co/fkWmNmc) decrease in November’s advance read while the [retail](https://ibb.co/BBKNrb5) inventories saw an increase of .7%, pretty much in-line with expectations while the trade [balance](https://ibb.co/CKSR070) also saw a surprise decline in the deficit to more than of $84B, $4B worse than the last revision.

[Today](https://ibb.co/D14JGZc) we get initial and continuing jobless claims numbers, alongside the money supply and the FED Balance sheet to end us off for the year.

In some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/GkZgGM1), we saw Fubo sink more than 14% again yesterday after another investing firm announced they have shorted the stock, pointing to the insane valuations of more than $13.000/subscriber.

We also saw a [research](https://ibb.co/QMF5fnG) that indicated some changes in the market share of car companies with Hyundai/Kia having the biggest gains alongside GM, while Nissan saw the biggest decline in market share, mostly due to selling larger & pricier SUVs with cars continuing to see a decline in sales, while the larger vehicles have started to rebound slightly, as all car makers are [bringing](https://ibb.co/kJGkXtz) more & more SUVs and Trucks to the market.

Lockheed Martin also was [awarded](https://ibb.co/bWS5G6j) a new Navy contract worth more than $900M as this might help the company start to get back on track while Mexico will become the world largest legal cannabis market as the Mexican Senate passed a bill in November which is [expected](https://ibb.co/VW3Lqtn) to receive approval in the lower house by February. This is great news for companies in the sector like ACB, Canopy Growth and the future merged company Tilray & Aphria.

Also, one of the biggest active ETFs with over $15B in assets, the [ARK](https://ibb.co/80WJFdW) Innovation ETF saw it’s first daily withdrawal since November, as this hasn’t experienced weekly outflows since early in 2020, this might have been driven by profit taking as this ETF has surged more than 140% this year and also just the ex-dividend date on the 29th, as people expect for the ETF to have a hard time in duplicating the results of this year, which saw it rise on the back of Tesla and Roku with both of them seeing massive increases, with Tesla having more than 7x-ing this year, as that is the biggest holding in the ETF, but who knows we have to wait and see as [TESLA](https://ibb.co/ZzGQgqX) may hit 500K deliveries this year.

And one last piece of [news](https://ibb.co/9bQhB4B) is that Apple did a big purge in their App Store, removing almost 40K game apps as this was the deadline for the developers to submit a government issued license number that enabled users to make in-app purchases. I don’t really think this will have a major impact for the revenues but we will soon find out.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/mvv7tjX) seem to be pointing at a mixed open, with the Nasdaq and the SP500 pointing at a good open while the Dow is slightly down, and with no connection to this, in the UK, the [BREXIT](https://ibb.co/Rh1DYyG) chapter is finally about to close.

2021-01-21 15:29:38,AAPL Earnings Strategy: What do you think?,"I am fairly new to investing and trading so need your inputs on this. As you all know that AAPL Q4 earnings are coming up. I was planning to analyze past years’ AAPL’s earnings and stock movement.

I’m particularly analyzing
Q4 2017 because iPhone X was released which was different than the previous iPhone 7 and 7 plus.

Q4 2018 because iPhone XS was almost same as iPhone X.

Q4 2019 again iPhone 11 Pro series which is again similar to X series but the cameras were different.

I’m expecting Q4 2020 to play out in a similar fashion as Q4 2018 as iPhone 12 series is very similar to iPhone 11 series.

I’m also thinking of analyzing web traffic. Comparing reach of Apple website during Q4 and compare it with the reach of Apple website during Q4 2020.

Based on these factors (previous P/E, stock price movement, options movement, IV changes and web traffic) I’m trying to devise a strategy and try to find if AAPL options are a good buy during the earnings period.

I understand this is a very generalized strategy (if at all this is a strategy) but would love your input on this.

What do you guys think about this?
What are your strategies which it comes to FAANG stocks?

Research shows splits add value. An Aug 2003 study at the Univ Illinois found that stocks that split beat the market by 8% in Yr 1, and by 12% in Yr 3. 

Why do stock splits work?
- Draws attention to the stock’s past success (momentum)
- Tend to be followed by increased earnings and dividends (signaling)
- Attracts new investors who couldn’t afford (broadens base)

He worked at Wellsfargo, just recently moved to this other company Janney. I doubt he was making any money off of my account, maybe at the most 0.3% advisory fees or something. Since I took a personal interest in investing and managing my money at the beginning of this year, he told me to transfer the managed brokerage account at wells to wellstrade, which is their commission free trading platform. So I've been managing it myself, mostly buying individual stocks since January and have done pretty well so far. My account is up 62% YTD. I have $63,000 in stocks (which are up 52% so far) and $48,000 in mutual funds my dad all picked which looks like are up 93% but I believe that is all time. Not sure how to separate just mutual fund performance into YTD performance.

Anyway, I'm not sure if I should sell or keep these mutual funds. If I keep them, I guess it could be considered the safer part of my portfolio since they're diversified.

2020-09-18 09:59:38,I bought A LOT of AAPL shares. Now I’m losing A LOT of money.,"I had the misfortune of materially entering the stock market for my first time two days before AAPL tanked. This was the first time I put a sizable chunk of cash into any stock. I was ecstatic when I made $100’s after the first day, but now I’m borderline panicking because I’ve now lost $1,000’s. The way I see it, it would have been better to sell at a loss a week ago, saved $1,000 bucks, then buy again once AAPL started to gain. 

Another week has passed, and I’m down even further. 

Proposed solution: If I sell now at a loss, my money stops shrinking. That way, I can be in a better position to buy when AAPL starts growing again. 

Would you sell now or would you hold on? Why?

Ever since that decision I watched them lose value. Ended the day about -5k. Feels terrible. Yeah I have a year left until expiration but it would be nice to not start in such a bad place. 

So here I am already bagholding the aapl leaps. Getting kind of nervous about money rotating out of tech. What’s left to move Apple after it’s massive 2 trillion valuation? The two bullish price target upgrades didn’t make it budge.

2020-12-08 07:54:41,Popular Opinion/Cold Take: AAPL is still undervalued.,"As most of you probably know, Apple recently switched from using Intel CPU's to Apple's proprietary M1 chip. But what does this actually mean for Apple as a company?

According to Forbes ( https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/11/11/why-apples-switch-from-intel-will-be-highly-lucrative/ ) Apple could save up to $110 per Laptop/Desktop. This is a significant amount of money per unit added back into Apple's bottom line.

And Apple says that Mac Laptops/Desktops make up roughly 9% of their net revenue ( https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/FY20_Q4_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf )

So I'm no mathematician. But I do know that Apple's new line of computers is retailing for a very similar price to last generations Intel based lineup. In addition to money saving, these new Mac's also become more energy efficient, storage efficient, and performance efficient. And Intel based PC's (to my knowledge) can't compete with all 3 of these benefits at the same price point or form factor. 

So what does this Joe Shmoe think? I think this holiday season a lot of people are going to be getting new computer's and I think for the price and performance a good portion of those gifts will be Mac's. I think that this computer generation is going to make a statement. And I cannot wait for Apple's Q1 earnings report next year. Apple is expanding its profit margin and computer market share. Things look bright short and long term.

I threw 75% of my seed money in APPL right before the correction phase in early Sept, which I'm regretting that I should have taken more cautious steps.

The sailant picture of the market I perceive right now is that it is a down trend due to high volatility in near future with US election, Covid19 vaccine news, ongoing rebalancing of portfolio from the growth to the value and rising concerns between US-China relations (there might be more...). 

I'm decisive that I'm going to sell AAPL for now, I'm just anticipating a small spike in stock price. 

I would happily sell at 110-115 price range, and re-enter at 95-100 price range. I will surely take a cautious step when I re-enter, the US market whooped my ass in this correction phase.

I still believe AAPL is a great company with firm financial position to deliver value to the society. Along with upcoming 5G era and the release of the new iPhone, the future looks bright for AAPL. 

But, what's your honest thoughts on stock trend of AAPL and the big-tech growth stocks in general taking into account the upcoming election and other uncertainties?

The only negative thing I can find is they’re closing 17/20 French stores (not ideal - but I wouldn’t expect that alone to cause a significant drop) and that iPhone sales were steepest quarterly drop in 2 years (down 20%) because of a 1 month delay on the iPhone 12 launch.

So - why the panic on a 20% decline in iPhone sales when they will almost certainly post huge #s in the 4th Q with all the 12 sales.

2020-04-24 12:12:10,How would an equal weighted GOOGL MSFT AAPL portfolio have performed vs. market?,"Let's say you started with $30,000 5 years ago to this date. No dividend reinvestment or additional shares bought.

* GOOGL $10,000 -> $23,009 (130% up)

A lot of people are looking for the hot, sexy young stock that will beat the market and double within 5 years, but sometimes the best plays are also the most obvious. It's easy to believe ""small company will grow faster than big company"" but the large cap growth companies have economies of scale and extremely high amounts of capital to invest in both their products and expanding their market share. They also have stability, great management and brand recognition, which breeds investor confidence and makes people feel safe entrusting their money to them.

This also suggests that index funds may be safe and diversified, but if a blue chip growth company is worthy of your confidence, you're potentially better off not over-diversifying away your returns. Note: if any one of these companies completely failed and fell off the map somehow, assuming no impact one way or another to the others, the total returns of the other two would still have beaten SPY WITH that company included by a significant amount - even if the vanished company was Microsoft, the biggest returner.

**EDIT:**

I will be posting a longer term analysis shortly following this methodology back historically using the top 3 US market cap companies based on the Q1 values of the [Financial Times Global 500 each year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization). I compare buying and holding $1000 worth of shares of each of the top 3 companies each year since 1996 (when the Global 500 started) on market open Jan 1st of that year vs. buying and holding $3000 worth of SPY on the same day, with no dividend reinvestments either way. Following this methodology:

Cash basis: $75,000 (25 years x $3000)

The ""Big 3"" portfolio: $199,445

SPY portfolio: $165,164

This is including buying and holding declining behemoths like GE, CSCO and XOM which are lower today than when they were at the top.

More details soon....

These  people never held anything longer than 2-3 months, never went through a  market correction, never witnessed a scandal that wipes out 15% of  their position in a day.

I am not  saying that asking about market condition is wrong but there are stocks  that don't and won't dip on days like these, less risky, more stable but  less sexy also. It's your choice to buy a risky investment and please  be prepared to see some losses along the way.

GME  created a huge inflow of people to stock market subreddits and I am  tired of scrolling through thousands of posts asking about market  bubble, market correction. Yes some stocks are overvalued but we are in  totally uncharted waters given so much money printing, covid but also  investor beliefs in certain markets.

You  are buying stocks like AAPL and MSFT at high valuations, you are not  that person that bought apple in 2003 and has 120000% gains. Please be  weary about the other side of your trades - there are people taking huge  profits - if we will have a lot of them in a span of 10-15-30-120 days  we might see a market correction.

If  you are new to investing buying a stock feels like a very intimate  moment, sadly, a lot of people already own/owned that stock.

If  you want safety sell your positions and buy ETFs (stable all world,  maybe S&P), maybe go for a dividend stock like T. If you can't  handle your emotions make your portfolio all cash and trade on a paper  account.

And for the love of god  don't call yourself a ""long term investor"" because you are bag holding a  20% loss. It might never come back, may come back tommorow, maybe in 7  years? You never know. We might see a bunch of people soon using that  term more often to offset that psychological game of chess with the  market but in reality you are simply not realizing that losses. I am  100% sure these LTIs are going to sell their position once breaking  even.

Stock market is a game of  psychological chess and if you are weak - you will be wiped out by  people with time, money and huge balls.

2021-02-11 11:08:19,Message to other young investors,"For background, I'm 20. The markets have been very exciting lately. Huge gains have been made....but also huge losses. I am in the latter group. I saved money for most of my life, and started investing during 2020 after the pandemic hit. I didn't want to trade, I wanted to just get long term investments and hold them. And that did work out pretty well. I was down red at certain points, but it was never SERIOUS drops, and I was confident that my picks were good in the long run. I wouldn't go into details about the weighting, but my portfolio essentially contained AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, SQ, NKE, ARKK, PLTR, NVDA, WMT, COST, DIS, JNJ, PG, V, and a couple other small picks that were my ""fun"" stocks - I actually had a few dozen APHA shares at $6. I had heavy tech weighting, but I was confident in the long term prospects. 

By this year, just about everything was in the green, and collectively up around 15%. Then came BB. BB looked appealing so I sold most of my stocks that had been moving sideways for a while (AMZN, MSFT, NVDA) and put the money into BB when it was low teens. Within a couple days, it hit the 20s and I sold for thousands in profit. The fact that I made thousands of dollars by doing nothing was crazy to me. The rest of my portfolio was also up several thousand dollars (overall, my profit was around $7000 at this point - a combination of the realized gains from BB and the unrealized gains from everything else). 

Then came GME. Several months ago, I neglected GME because I did not think they were a good long term investment, and so I did not buy them when they were less than $20/share. So when I saw the stock jump to 40, and 60 in the span of hours, I thought that was crazy. So what did I do? Naturally, I got FOMO when the stock was almost $400 and bought into the hype because I actually believed in what people over at another subreddit were saying. Within a week, my portfolio dropped around 80% (roughly $20,000). I thought that would be the best learning experience for me, but I bought into the weed hype this week, and have lost another few thousand dollars. **All in all, I've lost 90% of my money in the past month.** I'm young so I can recover, and this wasn't money I needed urgently. But my money I worked for and saved is completely gone because of my decisions. 

I'm writing this mostly for myself because I needed a reality check for myself and don't have anyone to talk to. I can't sleep at nights, and can't really focus on anything else. I've lost all interest in playing video games, and my grades are starting to take a hit. This is really embarrassing for me, and nobody knows I lost my money on stocks (nor do I want them to). I don't know if anyone needs to here this, but please be careful with your money, and don't invest more than you're willing to lose. Especially for young investors, we have such a long time horizon. There's no need to try and get rich quick. Conservative investing will compound over our lives.

Google has been lagging QQQ for a while now. I guess partly due to the ad cutting due to corona. But it also seems like their ad revenue growth has been decelerating for other reasons with a lot of players attacking the space from different angles (Amzn,TTD, Roku, FB, ramp etc).

 Their company culture is heavily based around engineering yet not so savvy when it comes to product marketing and expanding shareholder value. They come up with cool tech but seem to always be either too late or too early to the party. Google glasses didn't pan out, pixel phones are a modest success but not taking the industry by storm, google shopping is a money sink, Google fiber was curtailed, Fitbit acquisition is kind of iffy (Samsung/Garmin/Apple already dominate the space across respective demographics). They keep selling the AI future but Waymo seems to be the only thing they have going here that can turn out to be truly profitable. Will that be enough though?

Apple on the other hand knows how to drive share price. Always doing buybacks. Although they are historically a hardware focused company they are transitioning more and more into the services industry with their popular app store, Apple TV+, apple pay etc. Seems like this will be their long-term pivot.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

2020-09-17 08:30:46,Good idea to buy AAPL for a long term position right now?,"Hello everyone. It's currently raining where I am. Not too bad. I'm writing this to fulfill the length requirement of a post. God forbid that we can just get to the point of things but I guess that doesn't fit the controlling ego of being in charge. Oh well. Anyway ill get to the point now. Hope this is higher effort. 

I was thinking apple (or you can also refer to this company by it's stock ticker AAPL) is a good pruchase (or buy) right now that it's in a bit of a price dip. With the intention to hold it for long term, at least a year probably a bit more. 

So............................what do you think? What are you opinions on if this is a good opportunity to get a discount on a long position with apple (again, also known as AAPL)",1,0.51

The 4:1 is pulling my interest. I'm new to all of this, but I want AAPL to be my ""buy and hold forever"" for a lack of better words. I appreciate any help. This will be my largest % in my portfolio, pls don't attack, I'm new :)",12,0.67
2020-10-13 12:27:58,What's happening with AAPL (Apple) right now?,"**Context**: I haven't held AAPL during a release event period and am just a little confused about the price movement based on previous years and how it typically reacts.

From what I've been hearing there's typically a bit of a sell-off near events/keynotes each year but there's been so little movement today. I think premarket they were around $125-26 and they dropped a little to around $121-22 and have stayed there for most of the day. I wasn't expecting the stock to skyrocket or drop like a rock (frankly, I didn't know what to expect), but with everything I'd been seeing I expected at least something more than this. Does more movement typically happen within days or weeks after the event based on investors' reactions instead of before/during?",1,0.54

2020-09-17 11:29:09,AAPL - Thoughts on their future,"I have always been very anti-Apple. Last product i used of theirs was an IPod Shuffle. I feel their products are overpriced and the tech isn't that great. Basically i viewed them as all branding which is fine, but not a business i understand.

That said, I've been in the market for a new phone and i usually will get a 100-200 android and i saw some deals for Iphone with talk/text/data for $30 a month. That seems like a great deal and they seem to be going after the budget market while retaining their usual base who are locked into their ecosystem.

They have fallen below the $2T cap again, PE seems reasonable, and with hardware and their bundled services they seem to be set to continue moving forward. I assume they will continue to break into new sectors as their tech improves. I'm wondering what others' thoughts are on them. Room to run or recover? Overpriced",6,0.67
2020-09-13 23:42:10,Bull and bear cases for AAPL in the short to mid term,"AAPL is everyone’s favorite stock and I’m bored and drinking so I’m gonna make a post about it 

Bull cases

* AAPL is the worlds biggest company and has seen amazing growth in pretty much its entire history

* the new iPhone should be coming out later this year, people love buying the new iPhone 

* Apple products are pretty much household objects at this point, everyone has something Apple, and it has one of the best brand recognitions in the world 

* it’s trading at a 34 p/e right now, which isn’t super appealing, but compared to most other tech companies isn’t too bad

* we’re in a major tech bull run and have been for the last 10 years and especially so the last 6 months 

* it’s fucking Apple

* “stonks only go up”

Bear cases

* AAPL is the worlds biggest company, and historically the top companies don’t stay there forever. XOM was the biggest company a decade ago, and a couple weeks ago it got kicked off the Dow. C was the biggest bank before 2008 and it ate shit afterwards. GE was top dog at one point 

* it’s trading at a 34 p/e, which is 10 points higher than the market average 

* they haven’t done enough growth this last year to justify the huge run up. They went from the $375 range to the $540 range in a month and a half on nothing but a split which has no fundamental affects on the company or stock. I wouldn’t be surprised if they returned to the $90-$100 range ($360-$400 pre split)

* “tech is in a bubble”

Love to hear your guys thoughts on this. AAPL is and always has been the biggest position in my portfolio since I started investing two years ago",8,0.72
2020-10-22 07:59:11,ARKK and AAPL long term,"Have majority of my stocks in ARKK and AAPL. I know ARKK can be risky but I see potential for growth in the next 10-15 years. What’s your guys option on how it will continue to preform?

Also have shares in ARKF and ARKG but I like the aggressiveness of ARKK",9,0.77
2020-09-26 14:04:59,Why I blame AAPL for this selloff,"Firstly I'd just like to say in general, I am not an apple user, I in fact hate the OS but thats not why I blame them for this crash nor does it make me at all bias when dealing with the market.

To put this as simply as I can to save anyone time if you don't want to read the technicals or to get an overview, they are waaaay overvalued and make up too much of the market indexes. Simple reasoning, hype and fear. Suddenly after covid apple became 'a safe stock to keep money in' then hype built, then a split, now its just the realization of all that accumulation that has caused a sell off. 

But lets get technical cuz any idiot could use that reasoning. First lets talk about Apple, their business model, and their history. Founded in 1974 by Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, funded by Ronald Wayne. Wayne is inconsequential to the business so he wont come up again. Wozniak hasnt been involved since the 80s and Jobs has been gone almost a decade now. The motto behind Apple though was opposite of Microsoft's. Apple built things consumers needed and that marketed themselves. Microsoft built tech we didnt know we needed and sold that to manufacturers, not consumers. One is consumer based one is tech based, yes apple is a tech giant, but their basic business model is about consumer products, not technological advancements. I realize a lot of their products were technological advancements, but that wasnt what their business model was. If there hadnt been the market for a better smartphone we never would have gotten the iphone. There is a video online of steve jobs responding to an insult, and he basically states this during that video and its clear in what they produce and focus on. Most of these are things we see and use every day, thats the point. While yes we use Microsoft products literally every day, we aren't nearly as consciously aware of it as we are apple products. 

Apple has also basically stopped advancing rapidly, while every year phones improve they continue to do what they did in the 80s, fall further and further behind the competition. Microsoft bailed them out in the 80s with dos coding and they got bailed out in the early 00s by Tony Fadell and phillips electronics with the ipod. Guess what, they are falling behind again. 

Now lets talk the stock. 
For one, the market is based on growth, in order for a stock price to go up growth must be invisioned by investors otherwise why would anyone chase it up. Since 2015 apple has stalled though. While it's seeing great sales, the growth has stalled out, meanwhile the stock continues to go up and up, pretty counterintuitive, first warning sign.
AAPL growth https://imgur.com/gallery/vgoQBcD

Besides sales, technical chart analysis on apple should make any investor nervous. Here are 4 big market caps making up a good chunk of the nasdaq; apple, amazon, Microsoft, and google, with some trend lines im going to refer to:
MSFT https://imgur.com/gallery/x9pCHR4
AMZN https://imgur.com/gallery/r6uEPq4
GOOG https://imgur.com/gallery/krlTgba
AAPL https://imgur.com/gallery/pxtv4Uj

Did you see it? All of these are over their trend lines (google not much), but its a matter of why and how much higher. 

Ill start with Microsoft, 3 steady lines, 2010-2013, then 2013-2018, then 2018 to covid. Since covid Microsoft has seen growth in the use of their platforms like microsoft teams. So it makes sense they went a little higher. 

Amazon has 3 as well, 2010-2015, 2015-covid, post covid. This one frankly makes the most sense as amazon clearly got a major shot in the arm for business with covid lockdowns. So yes amazon is a lot higher, but they should be with everyone shopping from home as much as we are. Id also like to just note the richest man in the world jeff bezos makes around 215 million dollars a DAY. Amazon made over 280 billion last year, apple made 260 billion. Yet who again has the bigger market cap? Warning sign number 2 here.

Google has had the most steady trend lines of all of them, they have been on their current trend since 2017 but also have 3 trend lines total, 2010 to 2014 and 2014 to 2017. They are actually currently still right on that trend line and considering how diverse owning one share makes you (space x, ai, etc), this might be one of the mist undervalued stocks on the market right now.

Now our baby Apple, you have a trend line from basically 2010 to 2018. Since 2018 they started taking off, i guess that kinda makes sense since thats when their sales picked back up. But they had been growing for 8 years prior with no real world growth. Warning sign number 3.
Then if we zoom in with some trend lines drawn, well take a look: Apple trend lines https://imgur.com/gallery/Uhm3xT5
Since they announced their split jul 31st they have been moving parabolic (unsustainably vertical). Look how far off any realistic trend line it got, that is so far overextended of course its going to pull back violently. And now that their market cap (which is overvalued) is so big, when they move we all move. Microsoft is coming out with the xbox and all the gaming stocks are starting to go nuts right now, why isnt Microsoft, because of apple. If the Nasdaq looks terrible (thanks apple) the whole sector starts to bail and get into other recovery stocks like banks and travel, which is what happened. 

Apple went up 30% in august, microsoft went up 12.5%. Not even remotely close to the same kind of move. Microsoft went from 202 to 237, apple went from 97 to 137. To expnd further upon this, lets look at even prior to that. Microsoft went from 174 on may 1st to 202 july 31, thats up $28 or 13.86%. During that same period apple went from 72 to 97, thats up $25 or 25.8%, double what microsoft did in both cases. Dont tell me they all performed the same.

Now tech is starting to recover and the small caps are seeing big gains. But these larger caps may get stuck in place because apple realistically, still has a long way to fall. Id be willing to bet apple falls under 97 soon, followed by plummeting to 87-88, that is where the stock should actually be IMO based on chart analysis. 

Oh and here is how Samsung compared to Apple stock. Samsung vs Apple https://imgur.com/gallery/JirJ88i
Yeah apple is not that much bigger than Samsung and havent taken away their market share. Both are direct competitors that do the exact same thing.

I'm still overall bullish on the market, but damnit apple, you are not the biggest company in the world, you don't have a monopoly on phones and computers, you can't even advance your business more (they are trying with things like apple pay). Hurry up and correct yourself so we can start getting back into these great major caps like the Microsoft's, Amazon's, and Google's. 

Sorry if this sounded like a vent, but there seems to be so many things that people are just totally willing to completly overlook with apple, cuz its apple. At least thats my two cents and thanks for reading.

Part if my other problem with apple is its a lot like tesla. A lot of apple users swear by it and think they will run the world, the same people downvote this due to denial of facts. Apple isnt the biggest company in the world and it shouldnt even be in the top 5 realistically.",0,0.23
2021-02-28 18:44:11,Price Isn't Everything- Look at Market Cap,"I have seen many people not buy stocks due to the price being too high or vice versa. I have also seen many people think that stocks will go up a lot because the price is ""relatively"" cheap and has room to grow. For example, I recently read a Reddit Post where the author said that they believe TSM will easily go to a price of $500-600. However, the market cap is already 591 billion meaning they expect they will be more valuable than Amazon or Apple. I am not saying this is not true, but market cap is extremely important to take into consideration.

Apple's current price is $121.26 and Enphase's price is $176.06. Does this mean Enphase is the more valuable company? No. 

A company with a smaller cap has more room to grow than companies with bigger market caps regardless of the price they trade at. For example, it is more feasible that a 1 billion dollar company grows 10X than a company with a market cap of 50 billion to grow to 500 billion. 

If you think a stock is a good buy, don't become too fixated on the price and buy it. On the other hand, don' think a stock is a good deal because it is a low price. There could have been massive dilution.

Just the fact that apple is gonna sell more and bring more money into the company, that alone should make its stock rise? right? I know that they received a big jump in price recently but they already experience the pullback. Today seemed like a great day for them to rise in price, but they fell? I know i cant just ask, why did it fall, cause if you could answer that then you would be stinking rich. So a better question would be how could a new launch cause their stock to fall, could this be an indication that they are overpriced even though they're an extremely good company?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

20% lower than the highs (it was 135), even though it has grown a lot lately, it is ""only"" 50% up year to date (e.g. compared to 400% tsla), they are going out with a 5g phone next month, started online shops in India, PE of 33 (compared to 115 for amzn, 1097 for TSLA), lots of analysts/brokers still bullish about them, cult level followers

not to buy:

Sales have been lower, the china situation is not clear (e.g. if wechat gets banned from the App store, I know that in the US trump is pushing for banning download of tiktok or wechat, but I don't know if they will be forced to remove it from china market as well, also if trade wars escalate and china bans/limits apple products, Huawei and other companies like Oppo/Vivo are also making decent high quality phones as well, etc)

2021-02-14 06:01:42,Does anyone else think a catastrophic market crash is NOT coming anytime soon?,"I feel like there’s a consensus on stock forums that a catastrophic market crash akin to the dot com burst is happening soon. They use historical prices to back it up, and they inform anyone who’ll listen to sit on large quantities of cash, because everything will come crashing down soon

Is there anyone out there that thinks that won’t happen?

I can see a -20% decline over the course of a couple months happening in the next couple years. I can also see certain industries that are inflated to come crashing down. If you see what happened to [ZM](https://i.imgur.com/IumMxau.jpg) from October to December, I can easily see something like that happening to a variety of different growth stocks that are completely mispriced. 

But we also have companies making a LOT of money that can justify a lot of the prices. AAPL made over $100 billion **in a single quarter**, and they’re growing 20% YoY. They have almost $200 billion in cash alone, and they’re innovating and finding new ways to make money. Why is a $2 trillion market cap unreasonable?

Same with AMZN, MSFT, and other big tech companies. Unlike the dot com levels, tech companies are actually making a lot of money. I personally can’t imagine a -40% market drop that later stagnates for years on end when companies like AAPL have most cash in hand than their entire 2010 [market capitalization ](https://money.cnn.com/2010/03/29/technology/apple_valuable_companies.fortune/index.htm). 

I know this post is going to get of snark, but I hope we can have an actual discussion. The people who have been screeching “MaRkEt CrAsH iMmInent” are the ones that have been losing the most these last few years (by having large portions of their money uninvested in the midst of an incredible bull run)

With investors finally realizing the potential these tech companies have nowadays, and with tech companies making more money than what was once ever thought possible, does anyone else think a catastrophic market crash just.... won’t happen?",1652,0.95
2021-03-04 13:27:03,Corsair Due Diligence ($CRSR),"Warnings: I own a few shares of Corsair, my evaluation may be biased. I am not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice. This is the first DD I've posted, I probably messed something up.

TL;DR at the bottom.

This is the first DD I'm posting, let me know anything I should fix.

# Who is Corsair?

Corsair is a company that makes computer components such as fans, power supplies, SSDs, cases, coolers, RAM, and other peripherals. Since the pandemic, the gaming industry has seen huge growth with an influx of people looking for ways to spend time and the new dependence on home computers. It is my opinion that even after the pandemic, many will continue to purchase computer components and many will continue to work from home if possible.

# News.

Recently, Corsair has acquired Visuals by Impulse. Visuals is a streamer's tool to create overlays and alerts on their stream. With some streamers making millions of dollars per year, there is no doubt that streaming is an appealing prospect. In recent years, the number of active streamers has gone from around 3 million to 9 million with no signs of slowing down. The streaming industry is just getting started.

Streamers Per Year:

[https://imgur.com/a/WPUFhoE](https://imgur.com/a/WPUFhoE)

Corsair also released its earnings report on February 9th. Corsair beat their estimate but not expectations, so the stock dipped right after earnings from $44.70 down to $31.84 today. The tech selloff over the week has also affected the stock greatly. Other than that, the stock has been relatively quiet.

# Income and Revenue.

Corsair makes a majority of its revenue, $1.7bn up 55% from last year, from selling PC components(\~69%), and a good chunk of revenue comes from peripherals(\~31%). Corsair has seen consistent growth in revenue over the past couple of years and quarters.

Net Revenue was around 465 million, **up around 241 million from last year(\~192%).**

Net Income was at 103 million up from -8 million.

# Pros:

\- The price to book ratio is very low compared to the sector's(About 5 compared to 18).

\- The intrinsic value (at least according to my calculation) is higher than the current price even with a margin of safety of 10%.

\- Corsair is a very well respected brand in computers.

\- In the next few years, there will be big changes in the CPU market, and DDR5 RAM may come out, leading many to be looking for an upgrade.

\- The GPU shortage may end soon and people will be looking for PSUs to feed the GPUs and maybe fans and cases to better cool their PCs. Also, with the releases of the 3060 and AMD's equivalent coming soon to hopefully replace the 1060, many will be looking for new computer components. The 1060 currently makes up 9.62% of the GPUs used by Steam(gaming) users. With around 24% of Steam users using 3-4-year-old GPUs, there is no doubt that many will be looking for an upgrade soon. **KEEP IN MIND**, Corsair does **not** sell GPUs, but they sell items that are often purchased with GPUs.

\- Very high short float \~25% (Short squeeze?).

\- If you believe in Fibonacci retracements, Corsair is in the buy zone based on a 1-Year, 1-Day candle retracement from $22.97 to $51.26, -61.8% retracement puts the value at around $67.8.

# Cons:

\- There is a lot of competition in the industry, a lot of companies make SSD's, PSUs, RAM, etc.

\- Due to the silicone shortage, upgrading a PC is harder so it may lower the odds that people need new RAM, power supplies(power-hungry GPUs and CPUs), or cooling. This may be a good thing because once the shortage ends(hopefully), there should be a huge increase in the number of people purchasing products for their PCs.

\- I'm probably biased towards Corsair.

\- Current bearish momentum.

TL;DR: I'm bullish on Corsair in the long term, I believe that it is very undervalued right now. With changes coming to the computing industry, I see very big potential in the growth of Corsair.

AAPL is by no means a slept on stock, so I imagine that this sort of speculation will be done by many buyers.

2020-08-09 08:09:37,Current thoughts on AAPL,"I just bought my first stock recently and therefor am fairly new to investing and would love to get some feedback, to learn something. My goal is not to blindly follow trends but make up my own mind about a company before buying their shares.

**Why am I interested in AAPL?**

1. Apple is going to split its stock on August 25th, which should - for various reasons - result in an value increase.
2. Apple is currently the most valuable US tech company and also performed very well in the past. Adding it to my portfolio should therefor probably not be a bad idea.

**What are the recent numbers?**

1. During the first 3Qs of 2020, the company's net income has been 209.817 millions
2. 18.69% has been earned via services, 81,31% via physical products
3. The iPhone accounts for 53% of the overall net income and 65,26% of physical products sold

**Why am I hesitating to buy AAPL?**

* Apple's global market share for smartphones is only the third strongest (at about 14%, right after Samsung and Huawei), yet smartphones are the company's most valuable product
* The iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple 2020 net income. Other companies are developing features for competing products that are received by the public as equally good or even better. Yet I've read that CEO Tim Cook took Apple's focus from the design department (Steve Job's original focus) to the finance department, making the development of game changing features less likely IMO

I'd like to discuss with you why you would or wouldn't buy Apple. Do you think they will remain as successful as they are, giving my reasons for hesitation, or do you feel like half of their success is owed to only one product that could be out-competed in the very near future?

**EDIT/UPDATE after all of your comments**

Due to your comments and the views you have shared with me, I know understand AAPL - as a company - way better than before.

* Apple's bestseller is the iPhone but reducing the company to that device only is the wrong approach. Therefor other smartphone brands are really just competing within that device-class and are having a hard time attacking Apple as a whole. They might be the first to develop any given smartphone-feature yet are having an almost unrealistic time of really outcompeting Apple as a company. Why?
* Apple is a strong lifestyle brand which number one specialty is an interactive device-eco-system that has yet to be replicated by any other tech brand in the world. While others also build smartphones, tablets and smartwatches, it is very unlikely that they can really recreate the Apple-user-experience as a whole, were your main computer, smartphone and any other tech device flawlessly interact with each other. Huawei and Samsung do some things great, but they  f.e. just don't have their own operating system (OSX/ iOS).
* Apple is incredible inventive. From the Mac to the iPod to the iPhone, they were always pioneers in developing new technology and probably will very likely continue to do so.
* Apple products are incredibly easy to use for people with less tech experience
* Apple users are buying their devices for two reasons: a) lifestyle b) ease of use. This creates an upward cycle. Once they enter the AAPL-eco-system they likely won't leave it any time soon.
* The iPhone is their most sold device because it is the very entry point to the Apple eco-system.
* Samsung/Huawei/whoever might be able to build better smartphone-features before Apple for any given season, but it's very unlikely that they manage to re-create Apples mix of user-experience and eco-system. However Apple will always be able to level up and then put some innovation on top of it.

Now that I understand it, I'll buy AAPL. Thanks to all of you for your input!",0,0.45

I am looking to rebalance/add more on MSFT & AMZN ... these two will not be left behind in the wake of AAPL MKT CAP.  TSLA is doing its own thing in my opinion

Few things come to mind:

1. Stock split will have to happen soon in AMZN, I actually feel their plans might have been derailed with AAPL and TSLA stock split plans
2. MSFT & AMZN have a very diverse business portfolio and are less dependent on singular product sales like AAPL & TSLA longer term however with the ways things are in the world MSFT, AMZN and AAPL are very much positioned to capitalize.  The jury is still out on TSLA for me.
3. I think after stock splits of TSLA, AAPL the smart money moves to MSFT and AMZN, and their price movement in the last couple of weeks is impacted by the capital needed for investors to build their positions in AAPL and TSLA.  This is clearly indicated by the volume development in the last month AAPL and TSLA(\~+27% for both in the last month) v MSFT (\~+0.6%) and AMZN (\~+5%) in the last month.

The magic numbers: if AMZN or MSFT were to hit $2trn MKT Cap (not unrealistic), then their share price would need to be: :

\- $4K (AMZN) - increase of 18% from today.

To be more competitive in pricing AMZN will need to look at a possible 1:20 stock split

\- $265 (MSFT) - Increase of 20% from today.

To be competitive in pricing MSFT will possible be looking at 1:3 stock split if they were to proceed, but this might be a year or so out.

Looking at the speed and monumental increase post split announcement of AAPL and TSLA ... imagine what will happen if AMZN did a split... Lock, Load and be ready....

AMZN +4.7%
AAPL +16.1%

Research shows that companies that split their stocks perform bette than the market by 8% after one year, and 12% after three years.

Reasons:
1/ Signals management’s confidence that future earnings and dividends will grow
2/ Broadens shareholder base
3/ Calls attention to company’s past success

Which is kind of scary as Macs usually are pretty safe from malware so this is kind of a big deal. 

Apple also has the fight with facebook and now valve. This may be a non issue but bad press is still bad press until it is fixed so those are other bad indicators.

Other issues existing with Macs also in the news and front page google search.

And then the news last week of berkshire reducing his number of shares is bad sign. All these makes me wonder if Apple may be ready for another bullish week.

I do think they'll survive and be better. There's been leaks of their new earbuds which may bring some excitement, and news of the iphone 13 which may get people excited. So definitely one to watch, but I think from all of this and looking at the graphs, we may still be a week or two from the bottom before it goes back up.

I have like $4000+ in apple personally and will hold with hope of getting more through options or shares. But will wait as I think it will drop more this week.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

2020-08-24 10:36:05,OPINION (not DD!): Reducing AAPL position this week,"Don’t get me wrong – **Apple Inc (**[**AAPL**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/)**)** has performed admirably. They’re probably one of the best run companies in the world, evidenced by being the first US company to eclipse $2 trillion in market capitalization. With that said, I’ve decided that barring anything unforeseen, this week will be the week that I exit Apple, and began selling at $507.87

Why? The simplest answer is I believe it’s run up too far, too fast. Even a zero interest rate environment doesn’t merit mature companies trading at 40 times earnings, which is where Apple appears to now be headed.

We have to remember that different companies come into and fall out of favor, and this last decade has been the “Apple Decade”. I believe with that so much of Apple’s future sales are already priced into the stock, there really isn’t much room for further growth. Even if it doesn’t fall (I’m not predicting a fall, but that could happen), the risk is a slowdown in the growth of its stock price as earnings slowly catch up.

The final nail in the coffin regarding my decision to sell is the crazy run-up its had since declaring its upcoming stock split. That day (July 30), AAPL opined at $376.85 and closed at $384.07. The stock has appreciated a full $120 per share in the days since that announcement, and while it posted solid earnings, I don’t think enough has fundamentally changed to merit the recent rise in price. 

Please note that this post doesn’t guarantee that I will exit Apple (especially if the price should fall), nor does it guarantee I won’t repurchase it again at lower prices. But at this moment in time, I think any future growth potential is dwarfed by downside risk, so I am intent on averaging out of the position during the course of the week.",0,0.38

Lets say I short 100 shares of AAPL at $459.78 and sell a covered put at the $455 strike price for Net Credit premium of $588.

Here are the scenarios I can see playing out. Let me know if I missed anything?

1. AAPL dips and the put is executed. I would be obligated to buy at the strike price, but this would make a profit of $4.78 per share. $4.78 x 100 plus the premium of $588 is a profit of $1066.
2. AAPL dips and the put is not executed. Unlikely that the put will not be executed, but I would buy at a profit.
3. AAPL dips and the put is not executed, but goes up monday. Also unlikely that the put will not be executed, but I would sell another covered put and to repeat.
4. AAPL stays around the same so the put is not executed, but AAPL goes up monday:I would sell another covered put and repeat.
5. AAPL goes up and the put is not executed. I would set a stop loss at $465.66 and break even offsetting the premium of $588.
6. AAPL goes up and the stop loss is executed, but dips and the put is executed:I would be holding 100 shares of AAPL, but if the stock's trend is up then I can break even eventually.
7. AAPL goes up and the stop loss is executed, but dips and the put is executed and the trend is reversed. This would be the worst case scenario, but unlikely.

The problem is that it seems like a lot of companies are way overvalued due to the coronavirus pandemic (i.e. MRNA, NVAX, INO, BIIB to name a few). Not to mention, I don't see their prices being stable at all. One negative report on their covid vaccine progress and their price plummets. I need something more stable with 100% promising outlook for the next 2 years at least. I originally thought JNJ but apparently they haven't been doing so well in the past month or two.

Things I've thought of...

* Mental health care continues to be a growing problem
* Obesity and health problems related to that (diabetes, high blood pressure, etc) also continue to be a growing problem
* Virtual health care, but so far the only company that seems to be publicly traded is TDOC. It seems overvalued though- I haven't done much DD on this
* Ventilator stock? Similar to covid stocks, I'm inclined to assume I ""missed the boat"" but with surges in cases I personally think things are only going to get way worse, I like to think ventilator stocks like RMD could be an incredible pick. However that'd be a short term investment not 2-3yr investment

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

NFLX is dominating right now and believe they will prevail over Disney+ and Amazon Prime. For MA, I believe it will outperform V as it has been growing faster and is slowly gaining popularity.  All 4 stocks are winners but I only have about 5k and I'd rather dump it all into 1 stock than diworsify. Any thoughts?",6,0.76
2021-02-02 21:54:40,I went from being super proud of me to being disgusted of myself in just 2 months,"Just by reading the title you know what this is about. I lost money to AMC, GME. Not anywhere near people I see in WSB, but right now, I am down $1500. I know this is loose change for a lot of you and honestly, it's not an amount that's going to put me on the street or anything,  but it was my summer earnings that I saved for a trip to New York and cities around (I am from Canada). 

I am a business student, currently in University and investment finance always seemed very interesting and fascinating to me. So, since Canada banned non-essential travels between US/Canada borders, I was left with vacation money which was around 3000 USD. 

Instead of putting it in a savings account, I decided to finally start investing. I was using subs like r/stocks, r/personalfinance, r/personalfinancecanada for forums and was doing my own market research (the best somebody can do with little knowledge), learning, and was super excited to finally find a sector I wanted to invest in. Renewable Energy. I invested all of my $3000 in $PLUG, $FCELL and the rest in companies that are safe like $AAPL, $WELL. It was fantastic. In just around 2 months, I made over 40% on my 3000$ capital and I was really proud of myself. I was motivated to do more research, learn more, and I felt good about myself (University grades were great, potential internships coming soon hopefully), it was just perfect. 

And then the GME, AMC thing started. So much contents, memes, to the moon post, that at one point, I completely lost my common sense, my rational part of the brain stopped working, I went from speaking like a normal person to... You know what I am talking about. My emoji recommendation changed to the rocket, diamonds, it's like I completely lost myself into a wild cocaine party full of booze and tequila marijuana smoothie with mushroom garnitures and I drank them all and decided to become a R... (As they say).

My senses came back today morning once I finally noticed what I had actually done, and realized how much I went against all the single concepts and fundamentals I used to start trading. 

I am still holding, because well, market's closed but I seriously don't know what to do. Good companies go back up. Gamestop has nothing backing itself up except rumours of a potential short saueeze and faith of millions who went all in. 


It's not the $3000 (net) that's bothering me, it's just that, I started out like a normal person who was doing amazing and got turned into a cult member. I am not hating into anybody of WSB, I don't even blame them. I blame my own judgement. I learnt my lesson but then again, it's not like I didn't know what I was getting into. It was mostly stupidity and greed I think. 

Any advice, any suggestion, any smack in the head, reality check would be appreciated. Sorry for the rant. This is the only sane community that deals with stocks currently.

Edit: I would like to thank you all for all these amazing advices, for your support and for sharing your perspectives. They are interesting and motivating. I would love to reply to all of your comments but it's getting tougher and tougher with so many responses. I just want you to know, I really appreciate it and I am grateful for all these rational explanations.

Edit 2: To all of you WallStreetBets people, who are directly attacking me personally in comments or inbox, I get your sentiment and I just want you all to know I don't hold anything against any of you. I hope it hits the moon so that I regret giving up, and you all make up your loss. I feel better even if it makes me 'weak' and 'paper handed'.",773,0.84
2020-08-20 13:29:39,"If a stock like AAPL goes up 3% 30 minutes after market open, what are the chances it will go up 0.5% more?","I am developing a momentum stock market trading strategies, and I would like some solid numbers here. If a stock like AAPL(Apple), goes up 3%, 30 minutes after market open, what are the chances it will go 0.5% higher?

I am not completely sure how to solve this, but perhaps, look at a daily chart for about 50-100 days apple exceeded 3% in within 30 minutes after market open, and check the percentage of the times they exceeded 3% in within 30 minutes, and see how many times it went to or above 3.5%.

This effectively translates to if AAPL, the stock goes to 3.5% more than 3%.  However, we aren't done yet. Sometimes it might open up 3% and then drop 5%. What is your average return on a 3% open, is the true question. ",0,0.36

Also, and this is probably going to be a dumb question, are we basically never going to have recession anymore? I feel like we should've had one but the stock market rebounded pretty quick and what it seemed like to me was that the feds just printed more money and propped it back up.

I don't believe it will go that low anytime soon, but I guess you never know.

If it did though, to me if rather add more shares "" at a discount"" than sell I guess.



Anyways the cons I can see is that since its held in taxable, I will incur some short term gains, but that may be better than losing ( maybe temporarily) though some principle amount.

Would someone with a relatively long term horizon need a stop loss?

So do you set it typically above your cost basis or at some number below that where ""you don't want to lose anymore money"" , for example.

Wouldn't most long term buy hold type investors just ride it to the bottom or say 70% of your principle amount or something?

Then if the stop loss does trigger, you have to make the decision when or if to buy back in.  What if it shoots right back up way over your stop loss?

Now you're incurring capital gains plus buying back in higher, so you've lost.",10,0.75

My fear is of the bubble. I also feel that money is so cheap now and there’s no place to put money in, and the only growth seems like tech. But this is crazy. This in some way also increases the value of each user of the platform.

Is it worth holding them even today? I always feel like tech companies outside the states have better value. But it would just seem so stupid not to own the true moonshots of my generation. How do you decide? The trader’s approach of selling to keep it at 5% of portfolio seems bad because every month you sell AAPL you also lose its future earnings. Is that a good way to hold?

2021-01-17 05:13:12,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How is ""Hype"" calculated?**

Well, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

&#x200B;

I came to realize how good apple management team is and how good Tim Cook is at navigating the space in terms of politics. Apple has some of the highest margins (seem to be only increasing), insane revenue (they are still growing), good moat (its a hardware company basically), immune to monopoly regulation (they only control like what? 6% of the entire smartphone market?), great marketing, and have a lot of vertical integration (iMessage, Apple m1, iCloud, Apple Card, Apple one, etc). They also have shit ton of cash (they can buy Netflix full on the spot basically), and assets (their headquarters is roughly worth around $5B for example). Lastly, they have a lot of room to grow because they are so far from a monopoly, and they going into other areas where they can dominate (Apple Car, Apple card, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade+). 

Here are the other areas they dominate: Apple iPad, and Apple Watch. Nothing comes close to competitors. 

The only area where I can see apple failing is if they just keep riding the wave, and get lazy with their product innovations (you can argue this is already happening). However, after the latest apple chip, and the amount of cash they have, they got to be failing a lot and for a long time for Apple to be in any bad spot. Hence, it's a safe bet in my eyes with a decent amount of upside.

NFLX pretty much owns the streaming industry aside from what I believe are petty competition from Disney+ and Prime video.

TSLA already OWNS the entire EV industry and I see a very, very bright future.

I have just begun investing - been a month now. Before I could see some green, my portfolio is bleeding red. Having said that, I will continue to buy more as one day the market will come up. What advice would you give to a newbie? I don't know how long this turmoil would continue but at the same time I don't want to miss out on buying some of the stocks available at a discount.  But again, I don't want to purchase so much and see the markets fall further.

Any strategies you can recommend to go about this? Tech stocks are taking a hit, so should I start thinking about other sectors?

Many thanks in advance for your help.

2021-02-08 09:16:42,At what point should we come to terms that AMC won’t see $15.00 for a long while?,"I currently own 15 stocks.  One of those stocks is AMC.  The 14 others are a combination of tech, EV, and weed stocks.  Most high risk/high reward but a few “safe” bets such as AAPL, AMD, and NVDA.  

I bought AMC at $15.85 a couple of days before it tanked.  I’ve been holding it hoping that it recovers to just break even, but I’m not too optimistic about that now.  I’m currently down 62%.

I do ok picking the rest of my stocks.  Even with that clunker AMC, I am running at about an 18.5% gain across my entire portfolio

So my question is this, should I dump AMC and reinvest the remainder in a better stock if I can average an 18.5% gain on this new stock?  I know at that percentage it will take me a while to recover the 62% I was down, but at least that money will be working for me than just sitting there wallowing in its redness.",235,0.86

2021-03-08 20:57:34,Buy the dip growth candidates,"Hey y'all,

As the market transitions out of growth and tech stocks and into value, I want to position myself appropriately. these same stocks that have gone done 20-30% in the past two weeks are the same stocks that every wanted to buy a month ago, touted by Wall Street analysts but didn't due to valuation and recent growth fallacy. If you could pick a handful of high growth companies to buy and hold for the next few years, which would they be? Looking back on the March dip, it is crazy to see how cheap some of these stocks got.

I'm aiming for 10x on each pick, obviously there is a high likelihood none of these 10x but, to justify investment with a high risk tolerance and long time horizon it makes little sense for me to buy an AAPL or MSFT-mature growth

Looking back on it, I wish I had bought SQ, ROKU, TSLA, SHOP before they blew up these past couple of years into what they are today,. What, in your eyes are those stocks and why? Sure they could still be SQ ROKU and SHOP and I will continue to add these on red days.

My research has led me to consider the following:

**IPOE** (Sofi), I really like Square and may add it but its market cap is already 100 billion. I haven't done nearly enough DD and would love to hear other's take on it. Little scared the lending side of the company comprises too much of the business but it could give the co a nice backbone to pair with their brand's higher growth components: Galileo acquisition and trading platform

**ROKU:** Love the company, obviously tough competition but seems they are outpacing amazon and changing the way our streaming services are monetized- not sure if we'll ever see 400 billion here but I also really like **MGNI** and the pullback its given us.

**SPTK**: to me, this gives off plug energy vibes. It has a relatively small market cap, approx. 5 billion depending on the day and is a market leader in AI, clean energy. Massive TAM. I could go more in depth but I think its well positioned to grow in coming years.

Next up is **Unity(U) and C3 AI(AI)**: I am grouping these together because both are still extremely expensive based on valuation and are recent IPOs but have lots of long term growth ahead in both their respectable spaces, AR/VR and AI

**TDOC:** Huge fan of Cathie Woods but I struggle to develop conviction in this oen and would love to hear what you guys think of it- was a fan of livongo but it seems like that area of the high flying business has been

**PINS:** lotta potential here, theres a reason MSFT has tried to acquire these guys

**UPWK/FVRR**: As society becomes increasingly postmodern, the gig economy will only continue to expand, pricy now and set for correction as we transition out of covid but am long.

**ARKK, ARKF (any one of the ARK funds really)**: set and forget. Harder to get the exponential gains when portfolio allocation is capped at 10% maximum but still offer great exposure to tech with little worry knowing Cathie is running the show

**ETSY:** niche that not even Amazon can compete w, like the company alot esp after how they crushed earnings. Undeniably a benefactor of covid and could see more pull back

Notable mentions: CRWD, NET, ZM, LMND

In terms of value, I'd consider **BA, BRK-B**",22,0.8
2020-05-12 06:59:02,AAPL MSFT and an ETF?,"I own AAPL and an ETF in which a little over 40% of it is made up of AAPL and MSFT.

I'm considering buying MSFT stock.  Would it even make sense at that point to retain the ETF? The rest of the 60% is made up of other companies like alphabet, fb, brk.b, amzn, etc.

I was considering keeping it just to have exposure to those other companies but want to prevent redundancy in the portfolio.

2020-05-02 04:57:54,Is $AAPL really still immune from the downturn?,"[This post](https://themarketear.com/posts/cke_6tavL7) on the Market Ear caught my attention. Apple has had a fantastic run, but it has been steadily losing market share to cheaper phones with more features, and the rest of the business is pretty small potatoes. Its services income is strongly tied to sales of hardware, in my opinion: who would use iTunes if they did not have an iPhone?

What are investors in GE thinking of doing? This is usually not a good signal for a stock's health.

2021-02-26 13:33:33,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, February 26, 2021. Enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, February 26, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) pulling back while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) rose, rebounding from its worst selloff since October. Market participants continue to nervously eye rising Treasury yields. 

The saga between market makers and retail traders continues. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) temporarily suspended a list of companies from trading due to “questionable trading and social media activity,” according to a statement from the Commission. The SEC alleges that ""Certain social media accounts may be engaged in a coordinated attempt to artificially influence their share prices.” A full list of the halted securities can be found [here](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/suspensions/2021/34-91213-o.pdf?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery).

On Friday, the U.S. House of Representatives is anticipated to pass a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus package. The bill includes an additional $1,400 in stimulus checks to most Americans, $400 per week in augmented federal unemployment insurance, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government relief. The bill would then head to the U.S. Senate, with many lawmakers aiming to pass the bill before a mid-March cliff for when current pandemic-era benefits are set to expire.

Treasury yields were mostly lower today at 1.424% at the time of writing but continue to hover near one-year highs. Treasury yields are the interest rate the US government pays on its debt obligations, such as bonds. Very basically, rising Treasury yields affect the stock market in two ways: (1) it makes Treasury bonds more attractive assets for investment and (2) raises the cost of borrowing money for companies, which is why high-flying tech stocks were hit particularly hard yesterday.  Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management said, ""Driving rates higher has been a combination of higher growth expectations as well as higher inflation expectations. Until recently, market participants have been able to digest the upward drift in long-term rates, but it appears that the next leg up in interest rates is a bigger bite to chew. Looking at where real yields were at, they were simply too low when considering growth expectations, and it’s likely that long-term real yields will continue to drift higher as economic data improves."" In other words, expectations for more growth in the market, combined with inflationary fears are lowering demand in bonds, which in turn raises the yield.

* Robinhood[ disclosed in a filing Friday](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1561014/000162828021003429/fy20rhfshortfinal.pdf) that the company is in talks with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) over outages on the platform during the March 2020 market volatility, along with other matters surrounding options trading and communications with customers on the platform.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:

If you have a basic question, for example ""what is EBITDA,"" then google ""investopedia EBITDA"" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.

2021-02-27 09:13:47,Please judge the portfolio I’ve started for my newborn,"Hi all, I am investing 10k into a variety of ETFs and stocks as a nest egg for my newborn. I’d like some guidance as to whether any of this is redundant or simply a bad idea. I am really very new to investing, but was able to save this over the years with the knowledge that I wanted to start a fund for my child.

VOO (15 @350)

VXF (5 @177)

ARKF (22 @55)

QQQJ (43 @33)

AAPL (10 @122)

In sum these equal about 10k with about 5k in conservative VOO and smaller amounts in more experimental funds. AAPL is the odd man out here as a non-ETF. 

What do you think?",56,0.89
