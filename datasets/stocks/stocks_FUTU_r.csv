It showed up on my radar in January after I saw it go from $40 to $70 in 2 weeks. That's pennystock kind of movement and it scared me to get in as I wanted to wait for some consolidation. Well, consolidation never came and it rocketed to a peak of $191 before pulling back in the February-fuck-fest that all growth stocks hit.

FUTU's history is interested as it was only listed on NASDAQ on March 2019.

FUTU offers brokerage service provider and is transforming into an all-rounded online financial services platform integrating trading, wealth management, market data and information, social collaboration and corporate services.

The CEO of FUTU was the 18th employee of Tencent.

The shareholder letter is really good:

*Sidenote: why the fuck US interest rates would affect a Chinese trading platform, I'll never understand....*

So I started to look into this company. First off, they're expensive. Their PE is 107 with a PS of 40. If you valuations don't mean anything to you, then you haven't learned anything from February's pullback. But their growth may quickly drive down their PE and PS. They are expanding globally, outside of China and Hong Kong. 

They posted earnings on March 26:

Ironically, their earnings were great, but their stock still tanked. I have a suspicion they tanked 15% because of Archegos fuckery more than anything else. But I can't prove this. Chinese stocks as a whole got decimated on March 26.

Their YoY revenue growth was 281% with YoY triple digit growth for 4 consecutive quarters. Revenues were up 211% YoY. With trading platforms, the number of users matters a lot, and their users grew 60% YoY.

They posted a USD$170M profits on USD$427M of revenues, which gives them a net margin of 40%. Their gross margin is closer to 75%, which is very impressive. Their revenues have grown almost 3x YoY since 2016.

Their growth and revenue is very impressive. Comparing to what SQ and IPOE/SOFI offer, FUTU is a very impressive Fintech specifically around growth, revenue and margins.

With that said, I can't find any projections for 2021. With a PE of 107, if FUTU maintains triple digit growth, I think its easy to assume that their stock price will easily make its way to $200. Their forward PE is targeted at 30, which is low when compared to all the other overvalued companies we're seeing recently.


I think the biggest threat to FUTU right now is CPP regulations. They call it out in their 10k, that the are not an accredited securities dealer in China for Chinese stocks. Given the recent involvement of CPP, I think the looming specter of the PRC Ban-Hammer will be ever present. But the leadership of FUTU seems friendly to CCP and will bend the knee when necessary.


Does anyone have any other input on FUTU?

**tldr** I think FUTU is trading at a discount right now because of the recent Archegos shenanigans and growth stock beat down. But given that they're based in China and targeting expansion into SEA, I think FUTU is a great high growth and volatile company worth investing. They will live and die by their growth numbers.",5,0.65
