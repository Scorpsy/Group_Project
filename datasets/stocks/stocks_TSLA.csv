2021-03-03 12:03:06,A message to all the TSLA and NIO and general investors that are selling out and panicking.,"First off. Lmao. Cant tell you how many times I’ve been called a “boomer” for avoiding TSLA and NIO. For the people that are still holding on, good on you.....but the people panicked and selling at a loss, yikes. 

It’s times like this where we learn the most about ourselves. 

- Ask yourself what you’ve learned about your risk tolerance. 

- Ask yourself what lessons you’ve learned about the reason why you are investing and buying companies. 

When the market goes down or one of my holdings tank. I am often reminded of Peter Lynch. He says that when you buy a company because the returns are good, when the stock goes down people don’t know what to do and sell. I feel like this is a lot of y’all. Y’all bought TSLA and NIO in hopes of 7xing your money...but now that TSLA is down 25% from its ATH, and NIO is down 33%; y’all don’t know what to do, so you panic and then sell. 

About a month ago, I found this article by Financial Samurai 

https://www.financialsamurai.com/risk-tolerance-is-difficult-to-measure/

I think he shares an important lesson/warning about investing. Your perceived risk tolerance is an illusion. The truth is, most of y’all (including myself) have never experienced major crashes. I know a good chunk of y’all probably started in 2020 and only experienced 2020 style returns, let me tell you that isn’t normal. 

It’s easy to say “buy and hold forever!!!” And I assume most, if not all of you say that because it’s common advice and common sense, however we all have a plan until SHTF as the saying goes. 

It’s important to keep a level head when it comes to investing. Buffett always preaches that investing doesn’t take smarts, it takes guts. You can put all your money into VOO and have good returns, but if you can’t stomach crashes/corrections and sell, then you won’t make money. 

Personal way of dealing with this: 

When it comes to volatility, I’ve experienced some large 20% plus drops in prices and have held on. It’s hard but I’ve held on and bought more during those dips because I believe in what I’m buying and know why I am buying it. I’ve done my DD over the companies I’m in and that gives me the confidence I need to keep going. What helps me, is not looking. I’ll delete the app or turn off my computer and make myself busy. This helped me the most last spring, I used to watch it like a hawk when things would dip and I’d start to panic and think about selling. When I turn it off, that impulse goes away some. What also helped me was, before I buy anything I write down on a Word Doc, why I’m buying it; and before I sell, I write down and explain what factors changed that makes me need to sell the stock, if nothing changed, I know I’m being irrational and I need to buy the dip. 

So these are just my observations. Not professional financial advice but the tips are what I personally do.",278,0.88
2021-02-12 13:37:10,Elon Musk believes Bill Gates had a big short position on Tesla (TSLA) and lost a lot of money,"Elon Musk revealed that he has heard that Bill Gates had a big short position on Tesla (TSLA), and he might have lost a lot of money on it.


 
Billionaires Musk and Gates don’t always have good words to say about each other, but they do appear to share similar concerns about climate change.

However, Gates made some strange comments about electrification last year, including that electric trucks, like the Tesla Semi, and electric airplanes will “probably never” work.

In a new interview on the Joe Rogan Experience, Musk was asked about those comments from gates.

Tesla’s CEO responded:

“He didn’t know what he was talking about. Probably somebody told him that and he is just not that close to the physics of it. I don’t think he is ill-intentioned here, I just think he doesn’t know what he is talking about.”

He added Tesla already has working prototypes of electric trucks that are transporting cargo – something that we already pointed out in our original report about Gates’ comment, including the fact that not only Tesla has working electric semi truck programs, but also other automakers like Daimler.

But then Musk revealed that he has heard that Gates was betting against Tesla with a large short position:

“I also heard that at one point he had a large short position. I don’t know if that’s true or not, but it seems weird. People I know who know the situation pretty well, I asked them “are you sure?” and they said “yes, he has a huge short position on Tesla”. That didn’t work out too well.”

We have reached out to Gates’ foundation to see if we could get a comment on Musk’s claim, and we will update if we get an answer.

Tesla has sometimes been the most shorted stock on the NASDAQ, and people who bet against the electric automaker lost $38 billion in 2020.

2021-02-15 20:54:40,"Theoretically, TSLA made over 300m in unrealized gains with BTC within 1 week","Right before TSLA made the 1.5B BTC purchase, the price of BTC was hovering at high 30k.


I couldn't find a source whether they fully made the purchase  prior to the announcement or after. So let say  TSLA's avg is 40k. 1.5 billion would give them 37.5k Bitcoins.

As of today, it hit 50k just for a slight nano second. The valuation of 37.5k BTC is 1.875 billion at 50k PER...


This doesn't account for the TSLA sales with BTC and also 40k avg i would say falls around the higher average side.

TSLA might make more money through BTC than EV sales.

2021-02-22 16:22:20,Thoughts on $TSLA,"I bought Tesla during the dip in March because of Covid and have been holding since. It seems that the influx of competition in the EV market has been causing their share price to slip. It’s also well known that Tesla is extremely overpriced. I make a point to never underestimate hype, and Tesla is a great example of this. Disregarding share price, it’s a great company as well. However, it seems like it’s beginning or in the middle of a correction. I’m invested long term, but I am wondering what your thoughts are for Tesla’s future as oftentimes the first in a new market only enjoys an advantage until the competition shows up and economic profit begins decreasing.

2021-03-15 10:16:10,Question: what happens if everyone stopped buying/selling a stock (TSLA for example),"I'm still relatively new to stocks, and I'm still trying to understand this and I'm not finding clear answers as what directly (not indirectly) influences the price of a stock.  I mean, on many sites we can find out it's technicals, fundamentals, sentiment etc that affects whether people/organizations buy or sell stock, but that affects the buyers and sellers, not the actual stock price.

So, I'll use TSLA as an example.  Let's remove the buyers and sellers from the problem.  Let's also assume there are no shorts,calls or puts for simplicity.  What would happen if everyone held TSLA right now for months, no one buys more (they hold), no one sells?  Would the price hold over a few days, weeks or months?  Would it decay?  If the market had a correction, would the price of TSLA fall?

&#x200B;

\[EDIT\] Thanks for taking the time to reply.  I wondered if there was any ties to financials, but from what I'm reading, no there isn't any direct tie between price and financials.  So stocks are basically a value indicator and financials could be potentially completely ignored if someone simply likes a certain stock.  ",3,0.6
2021-02-16 08:00:59,Weekly Stock Market News | TLRY / PLTR / TSLA / DIS / AAPL / GM & other Stock Market News [02-16],"**The stock market finished another great week at record highs. Investors turn even more bullish with semiconductors & pot skyrocketing. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of last week, as we saw all 3 major indexes finish at all time highs with the [Dow Jones](https://imgur.com/9QkK5ca) gaining 1% for the week, while the [SP500](https://imgur.com/o3g9vaq) rose by 1.2% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://imgur.com/TMdS1Ly) outperformed rising 1.7%, as 8 of the 11 [sectors](https://imgur.com/VejvtiI) finished the week with gains, with Utilities and Consumer Discretionary losing over 1%, but it’s important to note that the Volatility [Index](https://imgur.com/qFVLzd6) also closed at the lowest level in almost a year, as it closed under 20 on Friday.

[HERE](https://imgur.com/cvTchF7) is the HEAT MAP from last week, that shows pretty mixed results, with semiconductors & financials popping while the rest of the stock market had mixed results.

We also saw some interest economic data last week, as the TD Ameritrade January [Index](https://imgur.com/V78bPVC) came in at 6.91, up over 10% over December as most retail investors bought Apple, AMD & AT&T. The other interesting number that we received was the investor sentiment [survey](https://imgur.com/Pi3tk6d), which showed what I was expecting, as it came in with a more bullish view of the retail investors as I predicted last week, which is one thing to look at as a contrarian indicator, so right now, I’m not really adding anything to my portfolio, but I am still gathering some cash for the next correction/pullback.

In terms of Job numbers, we saw Job [Openings](https://imgur.com/URoCI4p) in December coming in slightly better than expectations as the job opening rate stood at 4.5% while the jobless [claims](https://imgur.com/Ouf4H1d) came in down almost 20k vs last week but was higher than expected by analyst as the number of continuing jobless claim grew by over 50K.

This [week](https://imgur.com/1foTccl) is pretty quiet in term of economic data, with only jobless claims and some preliminary numbers of the PMIs while on the [earnings](https://imgur.com/rySV2ud) front, we do have a couple of interesting ones left with names like Shopify, Fastly, Roku, Walmart, Fiverr & many others reporting.

In some other stock market news, we saw pot stocks torching the market towards new highs in the beginning of the week, only to [crumble](https://imgur.com/TNZOw4X) on Thursday, but still, most of the stocks managed to finish the week with very big gains. We can see that the [ETF](https://imgur.com/XgntUvu) for these stocks has crushed the markets and has almost doubled already this year. This hole spike started after Tilray announced an agreement with Grow Pharma for a [deal](https://imgur.com/TuznO0z) in the UK and of [course](https://imgur.com/21Lt9F2) the “chatter” on Reddit’s biggest stock market forum. And by the way, it’s still interesting to watch the Aphria/Tilray merger developments, to see if either Aphria spikes again, or if Tilray goes down to counteract the current 30% discount on the merger.

Meanwhile, despite popping on Monday after a [new](https://imgur.com/xwv5lEU) partnership with IBM which will be available starting in March, Palantir finished the week more than 5%, ahead of the Q4 earnings results that will be announced this morning, and should be interesting to watch if they sustain the huge rise of the stock in the past months. (Later edit: PLTR beat on revenue but posted an unexpected loss of $0.06/share)

We also saw numbers from Tesla’s China [sales](https://imgur.com/fc8gduC), which more than doubled in 2020 and now stand at 21% of their total sales at almost $7B, as the model 3 was the best-selling electric car in China in 2020. Tesla also slumped last [week](https://imgur.com/KNzzLHK), despite popping on Monday after the disclosure of $1.5B in digital currency assets bought in January, as more [analysts](https://imgur.com/eMxGtXU) are pointing to a potential battery cell supply shortage in the future for EV companies.

Regarding earnings reports, there were a couple of interesting one’s last week, with Disney [posting](https://imgur.com/4x7GFjt) a surprise profit of $0.32 and beating on revenues, as Disney+ subscribers are nearing the 100M mark, while the current total direct-to-consumer subs stand at 146M. This helped the company return to profitability after just one quarter of negative [results](https://imgur.com/kvEjJN3), which is incredible given the big hit taken by the rest of their revenue streams.

Apple also had an interesting week after [reports](https://imgur.com/wHUEKv9) that they are not in talks with Hyundai, Kia on developing a self-driving electric car, while JP Morgan [speculated](https://imgur.com/UX2MvzG) they might partner with Renault, and pointed to a couple of interesting things, like Renault’s 1million units of excess capacity, their track record with contract manufacturing and the flexibility this might give Apple to having a bigger input on the manufacturing process. It’s also to be noted that this could be a nice synergy for them, as Renault & Nissan have struggled with their EV products, so this could provide a big presence across key regions for both of the companies, while also offering premium products, as Apple pretty much stands for premium offerings. Though, it’s still very [unclear](https://imgur.com/IYjOfBX) which way Apple will go, but it’s pretty safe to say, they are definetly moving forward with this project.

Also, regarding earnings reports we did have a couple of interesting ones, as the recent green energy favorite, [Enphase](https://imgur.com/tvpnxk0) beat expectations by $0.11, as the stock popped on better-than-expected guidance for the next quarter.

We also saw [Twitter](https://imgur.com/KQb4ClB) beating expectations for the quarter on the top and bottom line, but disappointed on monetizable daily users which came in 1.5M lower than expected, though this didn’t stop the stock to pop to new highs at over $70.

Meanwhile, [GM](https://imgur.com/Yk0tdaK) also posted great beats on the earnings report as the company showcased an EBIT 20% beat than expected, but this didn’t help the stock as it sold off after the report that it may also be high be the global chip shortage, as this has made big companies like [NVIDIA](https://imgur.com/oVFjne0) to bring back older products to meet the insane demand for semiconductors.

One last piece of news for the week was that Qualcomm unveiled their [new](https://imgur.com/vrKYXlS) 5G modem to compete in this new 5G rush, while also [objecting](https://imgur.com/9epoJGz) to NVIDIA possible ARM acquisition, as this could possibly limit other chipmakers accessing the intellectual property possessed by ARM, as this is used in 95% of the world’s smartphones.

So, let’s hope for a good week in the stock markets again, as we have to keep an eye on what big companies like Walmart & Shopify announce later in the week.

2) Tesla doesn't always go up. Sorry. It had a 11 day green streak. 

3) Tesla stock doesn't care if you sell now. Someone else will buy your shares for cheaper.

4) Tesla is a long term hold. Nothing has changed about the company to justify the sell off but it is due for a correction. In 3-5 years, you'll be grateful you held strong. Before November 2019, this stock traded between $100-$300/share pre-split for YEARS.

- The excess in today’s story stocks—electric cars, clean power and cannabis in particular—surely poses a threat to the wealth of their shareholders. Even if there is a wider bubble, it might not be a catastrophe for the country.

-not all bubbles are equal. The economic dangers of a stock bubble come from people taking on debt to buy shares and from companies overinvesting. 

-When the bubble pops, overextended shareholders have to cut spending or go bankrupt. Companies suddenly faced with investors demanding a return have to lay off workers and slash investment.

-None of this is an issue for the obvious bubbles under way in the fashionable stocks of the moment

-Even if TSLA vanished tomorrow, it would have an insignificant effect on the economy, as Tesla’s operations are tiny. It is mostly equity-financed, so its failure wouldn’t start a domino line of bank failures. And while shareholders would be hurt, there’s no reason to think that would lead to a collapse in spending across the country

-The closest parallel is not the dot-com bubble, for all the similarities, but the British bicycle mania of the 1890s. 671 new bicycle companies, raising £27 million in 1896 alone—equivalent to 1.6% of British gross domestic product that year. By comparison, the fast-growing IPO alternative of SPACs raised only about 0.4% of U.S. GDP last year

- Half these bicycle companies failed by the end of the decade, leading to 71% fall in bicycle stocks in18 months. But the British economy barely noticed this.

What if today’s excesses aren’t just in the speculative story stocks like Tesla, but across the market?  if I’m wrong and shares in the highly valued technology and associated sectors did crash, it probably wouldn’t be that bad. If Apple’s share price halved, it would make no difference to the underlying business. That is different from the dot-coms, which were forced to slash spending when the market crashed, and they lost the ability to issue expensive new shares.

TLDR

-Yes, there are bubbles of story stocks like TSLA now. But they are not funded by bank loans. They may burst, but they will not bring the whole market with them, like the housing bubble of the 2000s that were irresponsibly financed by banks.",58,0.94
2021-03-02 22:38:03,Ford Motors $F why the options market shows us the future...$gme $rkt $amc $tsla all started in options markets...," 

My thesis ( I am not a financial advisor) is follow the options market this is how I found RKT! Options are how $tsla kept skyrocketing deep OTM calls slowly getting pushed into the money by delta hedging. This happened with $gme and today with $rkt as well! This is how you would have found Gamestop $GME... When calls are very cheap and there are thousands of them expect BIG moves in the stock for SMALL PRICES since options are very leveraged especially deep OTM calls. Also be very mindful of Call/verse put ratios. For ford the calls greatly outright the puts but that's only half the story. The puts that are there are for strikes OUT of the money meaning they are getting weaker and weaker as we get higher and higher! 

The $12.50 calls are now in the money as of today and creeping up to the $13 calls once we pass the $13 there is no coming back down IMO! [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/options?p=F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/options?p=F) 16,000+ $13 calls moving ever so close to being in the money giving more gamma to squeeze for this week 3/5 and then next week another 5000+ ... that’s just the contracts for the next two weeks. If you dig deeper the number get insane. 3/19 is also another massive call option day and helps push the gamma squeeze.

To put it into perspective. Today the 3/5 $13 calls started out a .03 cents!!! They got up as high as .18 you literally could have made 6x your money buying the bottom and selling the top and it didn’t even matter if the stock hits $13 by this Friday. Of course no one is that perfect at timing it but hey even if you bought at .05 and sold at .10 double the money in a few hours... or attempt to hold and reach $13 by Friday is very possible so many ways to play the Ford rally!

My Position I thought you'd never ask.  2200 shares 12.50c 3/5 , 13c 3/5 , 8c 6/8

Call options give great insight into bull/bear movement. Remember last week went everything was RED besides GME and AMC?. Ford was down too but very very small % like 2-3% most things were down 10% and then today $Ford skyrocketed up a lot harder than other because it has lots of call options gamma effecting the price. There are almost no puts negatively effect the price. Look at the puts! Almost nothing in the money and the further we get away from $11 and $12 the less those ones effect the price! People were BUYING more calls correctly during that massive RED sell off day last week. Cheaper calls help rocket the stock back up!

Do some research don’t take my word for it. but I’m in ford!

I think Tesla's market share in Europe (about 3.5% per [marketwatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-market-share-in-europe-keeps-crumbling-as-china-reclaims-top-spot-in-global-ev-race-11614621780) ) is proof of that. 

per the article, VW sold the most EV cars in Jan 2021 in Europe. We can't even buy those VW EVs in the US yet. We can order an ID.4, but in Europe they already have the ID.3 and the ID.4.

Additionally, there's no competition at all in the mid-size/large-size SUV segments. (model Y is pretty much a small size and [(probably) not safe](https://insideevs.com/news/487821/model-y-third-row-not-for-adults/) for an adult in the third row

so the mid/large SUV segment is completely up for grabs

Once the Mach E, ID.4 and others are more readily available later this year, I think we will see how Tsla will play when there's other options.

2021-01-13 04:54:05,Stock Market News for Today | PLUG Power & GM | TSLA vs AAPL| AFRM & other Stock Market News [01-13],"**Big tech struggles as small-caps continue to overperform. Plug Power rises on Renault venture while GM reveals flying car. Is Tesla going to crush Apple? Let’s talk about this & other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market posting small gains, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/V2Yn5xJ) leading the way, up .28%, the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/hMpFmmF) gaining 60 points and the [SP500](https://ibb.co/YLYfs4V) finishing flat for the day, just about 3800, while the [VIX](https://ibb.co/sgR88nB) posted a 3% decline, though it seemed it was going to go back into higher volatility territory in the middle of the day

We also saw almost 70% of [companies](https://ibb.co/vHBQThL) advancing with 260 new highs on about average volume as 6 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/7pwD88M) finished in the green, with Energy leading the way yet again & continuing to outperform in 2021, while Health Care and Communications lost more than 1%, with Large-Cap Growth Companies being the biggest laggard, also continuing the huge underperformance compared to all other factors, as small & mid-caps have largely [outperformed](https://ibb.co/QH694Vc) since the start of the year.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/2Kt4ChR) from yesterday, with most big tech companies losing ground, though Tesla did recover after an 8% plunge on Monday and was also joined by the Banks, the Semiconductors and the Oil & Gas companies.

Yesterday we also got some economic data, with the Small Business Optimism [INDEX](https://ibb.co/12TgvbS) falling sharply to 95.9 in December, vs the 102 expected and 101.4 in the previous month, as the small business optimism has continued to drop after the highs it made in September, while job [OPENINGS](https://ibb.co/S0VG5PZ) came pretty much in line with the previous report at 6.52M, as the openings rate remained double the quits rate. And in some better news we saw the worldwide semiconductor [MARKET](https://ibb.co/8NZ79p7) gaining 7% year over year to reach $39.4B for November, as the world will keep on needing more & more semiconductors with improving technology, I really like this sector and I believe it’s one of the best for long-term investing.

[Today](https://ibb.co/s3c5sMQ) we start the day off with the MBA Mortgage Applications, Consumer Price Index and finish the day with the Treasury Budget and the FED’s Beige Book.

While in the IPO world, we will see [AFFIRM](https://ibb.co/6WqTmZX) start trading today, as the company set the final IPO price at $49 way above the first and second ranges between 33-44$. I really am interested in this company thought it’s unlikely we will see shares available to retail traders under 60-70$ in my opinion, while in the M&A department, we saw [VISA](https://ibb.co/CVkG87d) terminate the merger agreement with Plaid a year after the first announcement of the proposed transaction.

In some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/VBYhdY1), we saw Boeing land a $1.7B Air Force contract. This is good news for Boeing, as the commercial airlines business will be struggling at least for a couple of years until they ramp up the MAX production & airline traffic demand goes back close to the levels seen before 2020, which might happen with more easily scalable vaccines coming soon from the likes of [JNJ](https://ibb.co/VCpS3Kw), while they also did suffer another hit with a plane crash in Asia, though it’s not expected to be from a manufacturing defect, but [RATHER](https://ibb.co/Y2TZtNK) by the lax maintenance in the 9months the airplane was grounded last year.

We also saw Plug Power [skyrocket](https://ibb.co/3yChM7R) yet again, finishing the day up over 20% after the announcement of a hydrogen venture with Renault. This joint venture is [expected](https://ibb.co/LhFHnrX) to lead to further developments in fuel cell & hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, that will be based on Renaults platforms, as the companies will combine the manufacturing capabilities of the OEM with the fuel cell & hydrogen system knowledge from Plug Power. It’s expected they will also provide refueling stations to help the ecosystem, in an effort to offer vertical integration with vehicles, fueling stations, services & selling hydrogen fuel to customers. It’s seems a good & interesting development, but I would avoid buying it after such a huge [SPIKE](https://ibb.co/WkGwC79), it should have somewhat of a small pullback sometime soon.

In the Automobile world we also saw GM making a big splash at CES, with announcements of a big [PUSH](https://ibb.co/swv4wn3) into electric vans, a new Venture called BrightDrop that will develop even more electric-powered machinery and the surprise reveal of a [FLYING](https://ibb.co/G5bP3YX) Cadillac, while [TESLA](https://ibb.co/W2H1xrc) just registered its Indian entity just as ARK’s Invest CEO [NOTED](https://ibb.co/qWjZqmF) that Tesla is still way ahead of Apple by taking a page from their own playbook when developing their own chips for the autonomous vehicles. I personally believe that there is enough room for both companies to exist in this new EV path by mostly crushing other traditional OEMs which aren’t good enough at adopting this new trend like Nissan & others.

We also saw Walmart adding even more news on the back of the [FINTECH](https://ibb.co/DVKSgGb) startup, as they are also planning on experimenting with even [MORE](https://ibb.co/g7qgstZ) delivery options, as the company seems to be trying to innovate as much as possible to increase the efficiency, as they try to compete as much as possible with online-purpose [RETAILERS](https://ibb.co/YjMjDLw) that are high flying yet again.

And one last piece of [NEWS](https://ibb.co/zQBd1L5), is that we saw a report that suggests the iPhone 12 sold 18M units in China in the last quarter of 2020, exceeding all expectations and more than doubling their market share from 10% to over 20%, thus delivering a hit to Asian manufacturers of smartphones. This is exactly what I expected as the new iPhone 12 lineup should be a hit around the world, with many loyal Apple brand followers switching to the 5G technology and to the better camera capabilities. This will also help Apple increase the services business revenue streams, as an increased devices base will lead to increased services usage.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as both the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/HB5P34r) Markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/BgwpqT8) are mixed, with the Nasdaq posting to a small open gain.

[Cathie's estimate for TSLA by 2024](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target/)

$7000 is only an estimate with a bear and bull being $1500 to $15,000 respectively.

Based on my experience, it sounds too bullish but I am in nowhere in caliber of ARK and their research team. Their rationale is pretty reasonable too.

In either case, TSLA's current price should be a steal then right? haha.

Yes, it is certainly possible that they are just working with each other to pump, but neither Wood or Musk has disappointed anyone.

Was this in response to pre-split TSLA? Even so...

Tesla starts deliveries of the Model Y in China. Lemonade drops after the latest Citron short opinion while Nikola & GameStop shareholders jump ship. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of the last few days as I haven’t made a post since Wednesday, as I was busy making a full stock analysis on Amazon which you can check by clicking [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ky3nxo/amazon_stock_price_target_prediction_analysis_dcf/).

So, on Thursday we saw all 3 major indexes finish in the red, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MPQ6PVW) losing .12%, the [DOW](https://ibb.co/GJf3qV9) dropping almost 70 points and the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/r51hS22) dropping below $3800 to finish the day, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/sq1P6gm) rose again by almost 5%, though 70% of the companies were [advancing](https://ibb.co/yhsdpZD) on normal volumes with just 8 new lows, as 4 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/ZW0k1VD) finished in the green with Energy outperforming by quite some gap, while Technology was the biggest loser, as Large-Cap Growth companies were the [underperformers](https://ibb.co/jZW53gf), while small-caps shined, with all 3 segments gaining more than 2% for the day.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/hsmYfRz) from Thursday, with Amazon, Microsoft, Tesla, Netflix & Facebook all losing more than 1%, while the biggest gainers were the Semiconductors, Alibaba and some companies from the Materials and Oil & Gas Industry.

We also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/XZNYQHY), which for me came in better with a drop of almost 1% in bullish investors and 4% in neutral ones, as fear has reached almost 5% more investors in this past week, which is a good sign for opportunities in the stock market.

Meanwhile, Friday was even worse for the broad stock market, with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Ms5m47G) losing .72% as the [DOW](https://ibb.co/dKc4ZV0) dropped 177 points while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MkcyrQV) was the biggest underperformer dropping below $13000, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/RSGmvvN) continued to rise near the 25 level and even had a spike near the 26 level in the early morning, but overall finished the [week](https://ibb.co/SnvsgHc) down almost 3%.

We saw again 4 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/0GTqNZG) finish in the green, but this time Energy was the biggest underperformer, losing almost 4% and giving up some of the huge gains made up this week, while Real Estate was the only sector to post a gain of more than 1% and Communications continued to recover after a bad start to the week, as almost 70% of the companies were declining on [Friday](https://ibb.co/grwfwwM), with Large-Cap Growth Companies slightly recovering to finish the [week](https://ibb.co/vX2mxss) down only 1.2%

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/GdWj575) from Friday, in which you can struggle to find some bright spots, with the gains being concentrated in the Health Care & Real Estate sectors, while for the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/441kLYw), there is some more breadth with Energy, Banks and Semiconductors also posting some gains.

On Thursday we also saw [Powell](https://ibb.co/M7vznm4) reiterating the point that rates won’t be raised unless inflation becomes a serious problem, as he believes there is still plenty of room in the labor markets until maximum employment is reached, with this point being sustained by the increase in initial jobless [CLAIMS](https://ibb.co/X5brzGZ) which jumped almost 200K, a lot worse than expected and the previous month, as continuing jobless claims also jumped by about the same to 5.27M, a big increase over last week.

Moving on, Friday we also received more economic data, with the January [Consumer](https://ibb.co/n38hy4w) sentiment coming in at 79.2 lower than expected and the previous read, as consumers have lost confidence both in the current conditions and in expectations.

We also saw the New York business [activity](https://ibb.co/92Rydt9) coming in at 3.5, worse than the 6 expected and the 4.9 in the previous month, with new orders seeing an increase but being offset by a huge drop in shipments.

Business [Inventories](https://ibb.co/TRs2SMW) came in as expected at a .5% increase M/M, while Producer [prices](https://ibb.co/py4bpTn) rose less than expected and retail [sales](https://ibb.co/X2v2Y0Z) fell more than expected with a .7% decrease M/M.

This [WEEK](https://ibb.co/VqGMnJT) we start of slow, with no big data coming in until Thursday as we await the Biden inauguration tomorrow while the most interesting [earnings](https://ibb.co/B2T64dc) for me are Goldman Sachs as a continued read on how the banks are doing after last weeks good numbers, Netflix to see how the stay-at-home stocks will continue to perform and Intel to see how they manage to turn around things.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Aphria](https://ibb.co/nwxNpm0) beat consensus in earnings and starting a broad rally in pot stocks, while [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/vw4dXQ7) dropped more than 9% after CITRON went at them again, implying a drop back to under 100$ expected very soon.

We also saw IPOs soar again in the first trading day, with [PETCO](https://ibb.co/KwTHrvY) popping almost 50% and [POSHMARK](https://ibb.co/3cGk45W) more than doubling before dropping 20% as this IPOs are way overbought on every single launch just like most of the SPACs, with [Churchill](https://ibb.co/6JGGKHP) Capital also climbing huge on reports of a Lucid Motors deal, but this is only speculation and could have massive downside if the deal doesn’t go through.

Meanwhile, [Delta](https://ibb.co/FzGKp9C) Airlines reported Q4 earnings and hinted at a positive cash flow by late-spring or summer as they reduced the cash burn from $24M to $12M/ day in Q4, which helped most of the airlines rally.

Thursday was capped off my [Biden's](https://ibb.co/bzh0fsV) new relief package proposal that seems to be around $1.9T. This will serve probably as a start point of future negotiations. This package includes $400B in crisis aids including $20B for vaccines, $50B for testing, $30B for supplies and $140B targeted at helping schools reopen and stay open.

The plan also includes $1T in aids to individuals including $1400 stimulus checks and extending the unemployment benefits to $400/week through September, $30B in rental assistance and extending the federal moratorium on evictions and foreclosure through September and increasing the minimum wage to $15/hour.

Biden’s propsal also includes the highly debated help for state & local governments worth $350B & $50B in small business grants and loans. 

This will probably serve as a starting point and I don’t expect everything to pass even with the blue sweep. It’s likely going to be less than $1.9T, and most of the debate will continue to happen on the state & local help and is also likely to exclude things like increasing the minimum hourly wage, as this is not something temporary like most of the other costs and is likely to receive big roadblocks. This will likely be a short-term boost for the stock market, but the impacts of this in terms of inflation, debt and other economic factors are still unknown in the long-run.

And moving on, Friday we saw [Tesla's](https://ibb.co/Vqmf9Mm) forecasted deliveries increased to 1M cars by Wedbush who also raised their price target to $950 with a bull case of $1250, as the Tesla [Model Y](https://ibb.co/1Qws23d) has finally started deliveries in China and will be one of the biggest bets Tesla has made, as the affordable SUV demand is much higher than any of the other Tesla models, while in contrast [Nikola](https://ibb.co/r3dFQSk) seems to be having firms jumping board with an early investor recently selling over 7M shares. Some similar action was seen from the director of [GameStop](https://ibb.co/rvyQdvq) who sold 800K shares after the recent pop in the stock. This kind of companies provide high risk/high reward opportunities, but you should have a tight approach to them, you should take profits whenever you can and not risk losing your gains on these highly volatile stocks that don’t have a good fundamental basis.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/nr2Pw5W) markets seem to be pointing to a good day, as we await Biden’s pick Janet Yellen’s [remarks](https://ibb.co/bsjzK1b) on the proposed stimulus and the dollar while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/S3cfpZq) are also pointing to a green open, with the Nasdaq leading the way.

The earnings frenzy starts with Apple, Tesla, Facebook & Microsoft reporting. GameStop, GM & Ford spiked last week, let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of Friday as we saw most of the stock market giving up some of the big gains of the week, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/ZxdGSkm) losing .30% & the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/MRn5Q40) Industrial dropping 179 points while the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/F3wm2d8) barely managed to post a small gain for the day as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/JRkwsZn) ticking up a little but finishing under 22 for the week, with the Nasdaq gaining 4.2% in the short week the SP500 rising 1.9% and the Dow Jones posting a .6% gain.

About 55% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/hFF1hSm) were advancing on below average volume as the number of companies moving above the moving averages still remains very high. We only saw 3 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/pPJpQCk) posting small gains for the day while the biggest losers were the value play in Financials, Energy and Industrials, all losing more than .50%

For the week we saw communications outperform with a big spike after Netflix reported earnings, while Energy had more than one ugly day dropping big on Monday, Thursday and Friday.

Small-caps faired better to close out the [week](https://ibb.co/y0C39gJ), with all 3 groups posting gains of more than 1.5% while Large-Cap Value companies underperformed losing more than 2.5% for the week, as Growth Companies & Especially the big-caps finally outperformed this week, gaining 2.3%.

Here is the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/MnWSRV4), which was a pretty mixed bag, with Apple posting a big gain ahead of the earnings report while the other big tech companies also posted small-gains. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/BfYRHWS) though, we saw huge gains in most of the big tech names with all the FAANG names and Microsoft gaining more than 5% for the week, while Banks alongside Oil & Gas companies were the biggest losers

We also got some economic data on Friday as existing home [sales](https://ibb.co/KWxRW9m) rose again while the inventory is still at all time-lows of under 2 months of supply while the January [PMI](https://ibb.co/x54dqCy) current read came in at 58, way above the 55.5 expected and 55.3 in the previous read as both the Services and Manufacturing PMI saw a spike of more than 2 points

This week we also start the [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/2nsRvBx) frenzy, with AMD which might benefit from Intel’s drop last week, Microsoft & Starbucks reporting after Tuesday’s close as JNJ might also give some updates regarding their vaccine, while big value companies like Boeing, AT&T & Caterpillar report before the open on Wednesday & Friday. We also have some of the big tech names reporting on the same day, with Apple which is expected to have their first $100B quarter, Tesla & Facebook reporting after Wednesday’s close which might be a bigger volatility moment for the market depending on how the results come in.

In terms of economic [data](https://ibb.co/Fx6TWyw), we start off [today](https://ibb.co/4K4DDvp) with the Dallas FED Manufacturing survey but the most interesting ones are on Thursday & Friday, while we also wait to see what the FED announces in terms keeping the rates low & the money printer going with asset buying on Wednesday.

In some other stock market, we saw [Palantir](https://ibb.co/zV2vxft) soar on Friday, rising more than 25% to break the $30 levels after they updated their Demo Day scheduled for tomorrow. It’s expected that they will reveal the latest developments in their big software platforms and also reveal [new](https://ibb.co/swYH61R) software platforms that will continue to help the company grow such as SDDI, Low-Code/No-Code and other modular strategy software.

We also saw [Ford](https://ibb.co/D8cmmZn) soaring again, as the company is having the best monthly performance in more than 10 years and spiked more than 6% after JP Morgan upgraded the company based on their new product line which is what I’ve been saying about the company in some months now. Tesla is going to face serious competition in the next decade with all the other car manufactures pushing harder and harder into the EV world, with some of the most popular cars out there like the F150, the Bronco and other models joining the sector that will continue to improve and might actually become a good alternative to Tesla’s models. It’s the same with others like [GM](https://ibb.co/42G3ttK) which might be a good catch-up play compared to Tesla. By the way… [GM](https://ibb.co/vPwbPCs) is outperforming Tesla recently based on their developments in the EV & self-driving sector.

Meanwhile, [GME](https://ibb.co/bXYsj4k) had a wild day on Friday, gaining more than 50% despite being even higher as the battle between WSB & the shorts continues, with this move making Citron’s Left deciding to avoid further talks about the company probably in an attempt to avoid future attention at the GameStop short squeeze. Short Squeeze has seen a big rise in terms of [search](https://ibb.co/qn51BPH) interest after these latest moves in the GameStop stock and might even put more pressure on the bears, as retail investors might pump up this stock even more.

So, guys, this week might bring a lot of volatility depending on many of the important events we have. Earnings seasons & especially big tech results will be important to justify these high multiples most of the tech names have received, while we also have to see how the GDP comes in, as it is expected to have seen a 4% growth for the 4th quarter while the FED is under pressure to keep the money printer on and the rates low, if not, or if there is any doubt in their commitments and also some numbers come in worse than expected we might see the long-awaited correction/pullback. But I don’t think numbers or the FED are going to disappoint really, but that doesn’t exclude the possibility of the pullback… keep investing safely & have some money available to buy the dips if they appear, use them as a buying opportunity, not a panic sell.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/929L2rz) are pointing to a very good open, with the Nasdaq leading the way up almost 1%

What do you think will be the future and the next huge stock?

I know this is a risky AF stock, but I am not an experienced trader, I'm a casual etrade guy who only knows the bare basics, I don't even know much of the terminology behind all of this. 

So what should I do with this? I've heard rumors they're going to split it again? My goal here would be to maximize profit with TSLA and then sell off and buy into much more secure long term options.  What do experienced traders suggest here?",6,0.8

So I am trying to understand how Robo taxi and autonomous helps tsla justify this valuation but doesn't help GOOG and AMZN at all. Because they can actually vertically integrate these services into their business. Imagine Booking a waymo ride from Google Maps which is already installed on like BILLIONS of devices? same with Zoox, they can integrate it with Amazon Prime membership

TL;DR

Don't buy into the TSLA cult when they try to sell you on autonomous and robo taxi. There are other tech companies like NVDA, AMZN and GOOG already ahead of the game with vertical integration in their products

Is Lemonade overvalued? FuboTv keeps on crumbling while NIO posts great sales numbers, let’s talk about this & other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of the last trading day of 2020, as we saw both the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/bHgX2sf) and the [Dow Jones Industrial](https://ibb.co/D471c7X) finish up over 0.60% and finishing at record highs, while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/vzGgSBb)  finished barely up for the day, gaining .14%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/2YrvMpT) finishing just down for the day, but it’s still up from a [week](https://ibb.co/LxdGJ8c) ago, as the volatility still remains way above the [levels](https://ibb.co/XbWkzW4) before March when it rose to over 80.

We just about saw a positive ratio of companies [advancing](https://ibb.co/5TwrM2m) to close out the year as the volume was belove average with just 100 new highs, as we saw 10 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/yyrTGGP) finishing in the green with Utilities, Financials, Real Estate & Health Care gaining more than 1% while Energy was the only sector to finish the day with a loss.  
We also saw most factor groups [finishing](https://ibb.co/dmvNJgL) the day in the red with only Large-Cap Value companies posting a gain of .3%, as you can see in Thursday’s [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/wBGr7cR) with gains all around the board, while losses were concentrated in the Biotech and Oil & Gas industry.

Here is the weekly [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/zQWD12B) with names like Alibaba, Shopify, Palantir, Square and Zoom being some of the biggest losers, while TESLA continued to push higher as Tesla finished the month of [December](https://ibb.co/ZX09X8Z) with a gain of more than 20% as you can see here, while many of the other big tech names also had a strong month, with most of the losses being concentrated in the communication sector and of course Alibaba which was hit by a lot of negative news.

We also [finished](https://ibb.co/r5JRk5b) the year with most sectors in the green as you can see here, led by Technology, Consumer Cyclicals and Communications. But gains were had in most other sectors as well, except the Financial, Travel and Energy sectors, which finished the year down.

The biggest [losers](https://ibb.co/nDgRs1S) in the SP500 which finished the year up more than 16% were by far stocks like Carnival, OXY, Norwegian Cruise Line, United Airlines and many more others. The Nasdaq 100 wasn’t safe either despite jumping almost 50% in 2020, having the best gains in 11years, with companies like Walgreens, Fox and Intel posting losses of over 17%, while the Dow was the laggard finishing just over 7% up for the year as Boeing, Chevron and Intel dragged the index lower.

We also saw huge [winners](https://ibb.co/n7yP7cM)  in 2020, as the SP500 was led higher by stocks like Apple, Nvidia, PayPal, Amazon and many others that posted huge gains. While the Nasdaq 100 jumped to record highs lead by Tesla which posted an incredible year with other stocks like Moderna, Peloton & Zoom also rising by more than 300%. The Dow also had big winners but still lagged as the biggest gainers here were the tech giants Apple & Microsoft joined by some other stocks like Nike, Disney & Salesforce.

We also got some economic data since Thursday as Macau’s gaming [revenue](https://ibb.co/NWBrC3s) continued the slow recovery, but the visits in the travel dependent region were 20% higher in the Holiday period compared to the start of December, which may be another positive sign for the Macau Gambling business.

Meanwhile we also received the latest jobless [numbers](https://ibb.co/Km8px8X), which dipped below 800K again, 19K less than last week and more than 40K less than expected, as the continuing jobless claims also fell to just over 5.2M more than 100K better than expected and the previous [report](https://ibb.co/gJLQYPB).

While this [week](https://ibb.co/mDnXFZY) we start to receive important economic data that alongside the results of the Georgia runoff election might push the market either to more gains, or if the results and data don’t show up as investors & analysts expected it, we might see an increase in volatility again which will lead to a market pullback or correction, which in my opinion would be a good time to go out and find deals to buy again.

We also really don’t get any significant [earnings](https://ibb.co/60QM77h) releases this week, with most of the interesting ones like Micron, Walgreens & Bed Bath & Beyond coming on Thursday.

So, in some other stock market news, Tesla topped [expectations](https://ibb.co/g9048Ry) of 163K deliveries in Q4 again but did finish just shy of the 500K mark. The company delivered more than 180K vehicle in the last quarter, as we saw [Tesla](https://ibb.co/th7Hhnc)  pricing the model Y at just over $50.000 in China and are expecting to start deliveries this month as they keep expanding their sales in the world’s biggest car market, as they are targeting to make this their biggest market surpassing the US. Tesla closed over 700$ for the first time and if you want to see my opinion on this stock, check out my prediction on Tesla [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kci399/my_tesla_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell/).

Some other EV makers from China also posted sales numbers with [Li Auto](https://ibb.co/LYCSs1N) increasing deliveries five-fold year/year with a 32% increase month/month in December, while [XPENG](https://ibb.co/Zc7FSQC) also announced record delivery numbers up 35% month/month and more than 300% year/year for December. We also saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/4VWGX78) posting a monthly deliveries record of just over 7K, up over 120% year/year and finishing the year with over 43K deliveries, which were also up over 110% year/year, as they are also planning on revealing some new sedan models and their latest developments on self-driving and other technologies next week.

Meanwhile we saw [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/dKh6kx0) take a ride after another short-seller released a statement, pointing out to the final lock-up period after the IPO, as a moment that will bring huge selling to this stock, despite the [company](https://ibb.co/YWksq6g) needing just over 4 years to reach the first million customers, less than 5 times the time it took companies like StateFarm, Geico and Allstate to reach their first million. I personally am an investor in this company, and I really like what they are doing, so I am not going to sell my shares anytime soon.

Guys, personally I can’t wait to see the sales numbers and how the services business is growing for [Apple](https://ibb.co/cx07jJs) as the top-of-the-line products keep having great demand, but we do have to see what happens in the US-China relations, as this could impact the Apple revenue stream, this after the New York Stock Exchange has [started](https://ibb.co/599nrxc) the process of delisting telecom giants from China. You can check out my prediction on Apple [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kmp7x1/apple_aapl_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell/)

We also saw a [memo](https://ibb.co/qyBfzrq) from DELTA’s CEO, as he expects the company to return to positive cashflow in the spring, as they are planning to start paying down debt as soon as that happens to reduce the burden the company has taken on since March 2020.

Meanwhile [FuboTV](https://ibb.co/Dg5jZ6x) continues its sharp decline after a number of firms have started to short the stock pointing to insane valuations and outlook. Fubo plunged again almost 16% Thursday and is down almost 50% in the past week as the IPO lockup period expired, more than tripling the shares float.

And on last piece of news that just came out is that [Roku](https://ibb.co/gM8Z4Bv) is looking to buy the content catalog from Quibi, this would give a boost to Roku’s exclusive programming, as the stock has seen an immediate reaction and is up over 3.5% in pre-market trading.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/zf9tMYZ) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the SP500 leading the way to start off the year as we wait to receive the first economic [data](https://ibb.co/f24tRCS) this year in the early morning, while the global stock [markets](https://ibb.co/sjvZMrx) started on a positive note except Japan.

Both are down 3% - 4% today. I knew TSLA was in a bubble but figured it wouldn't pop until about $1.1k... is this it, do you guys think it's going to dip hard? If so... will it ever regain its value?

Id also appreciate anyone's insights into why NIO dipped today when all I'm hearing is good things about it in the near future.

Lemonade rises by more than 20% again while reports continue to come in on the Apple Car. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a big rally in the stock market after the [Biden](https://ibb.co/QpPkkvg) confirmation and Trump called for a smooth transition with the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/sw8bKdb) recovering the previous day losses and closing at over 13K. We also saw the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/MnjT8BH) gaining almost 1.5% and finishing over 3800 while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/ykPckZD) also posted a gain of over 200 points to close at just over 31k with all 3 of the big indexes finishing at new records. This broad rally pushed the [VIX](https://ibb.co/5MY0P1w) down, as the volatility index finished the day lower by more than 10% as 9 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/nmc7x8X) finished in the Green with Technology leading the way up 2.7%, while Utilities was the biggest laggard dropping by 1.3%.

Growth companies largely outperformed [yesterday](https://ibb.co/XpHGdhb) with both small and large cap growth companies posting big gains across the board, while value plays lagged behind, as 2/3 of the companies were advancing [YESTERDAY](https://ibb.co/NLLMyLY) with over 300 new highs on average volume.

So, let’ take a look at the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/ys6zg6M) from yesterday, as big tech companies flourished with the likes of Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Nvidia, Tesla and many more posting gains at least 2%, while most of the losses were concentrated in the Chinese stocks that are being delisted and the more value heavy utilities sector.

Yesterday we also received the investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/10gRPgn), which saw a worrying move in the stock market, as bullish investors surpassed 50% of the total investors and is near the 1-year high from November. Most of this move to the bullish side came from neutral investors, which are way below the historical [average](https://ibb.co/XbyKxjB), which probably decided to get back in the market, rushing in the clean energy sector, the industrials and many others after the Democrats swept the Georgia election. I remind you that I usually use this survey as a contrarian indicator, when sentiment moves to this much greed in the market, I usually don’t like to add to my positions, as I await to buy stocks on red days.

We also received some economic data yesterday, as we saw December’s homes for [SALE](https://ibb.co/7Y3njz3) fall to an all-time low, below 700K as the housing market keeps on booming, with homes selling faster by about 2 weeks compared to last year while the national inventory dropped by almost 40% since last year, as the median listing price was $340K, up over 13% since 2019.

[Today](https://ibb.co/t4bS0wH) is a quieter economic day, with the biggest number coming in the early morning as we wait to see the non-farm payrolls.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Nikola](https://ibb.co/DLP8f1P) joining the broad rally in the EV [STOCKS](https://ibb.co/mJgVqwr) yesterday which pushed almost every single stock higher, while we also saw a report from JP Morgan on some possible good developments on their trucks. I don’t believe in this company, it’s bad history, bad management and reputation will hurt it in the long even if they manage to develop a decent product, which is still to be seen, as they haven’t really brought anything innovative to the market.

One other stock that rose yesterday was [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/FbZZ5Lz), as the stock spiked more than 27% yesterday, after the company was pitched by the Motley Fool yet again. I really like this company, and I think it has major disruption potential in the insurance world, so I agree with this report. The stock did suffer a slight pullback about a week ago after a report from The Friendly Bear but I don’t believe it will have a long-lasting effect, as I believe this stock has great growth potential.

[Apple](https://ibb.co/Xzscpk6) also seems to be confirming the previous reports and is in talks with Hyundai about a development of a self-driving EV, as we heard something about this from Hyundai before some confusion made them kind of back out of the previous statement. This report is pretty much as anticipated, as Apple would probably be looking to either collaborate on manufacturing with a traditional car manufacturer or actually just acquiring pretty much any one of them.

We also saw [Snowflake](https://ibb.co/vZ1v7yw) regain some momentum yesterday, rising by more than 13% despite the expiration period of another 38M shares. The latest IPOs and small-cap stocks have recently been able to raise a lot of capital as investors seem to be grabbing any share available at almost any price regarding valuations. This is a very dangerous thing yet again. This kind of stuff was happening in the last dot com bubble, though… I don’t really expect anything like that to happen with the overall stock market, but I think we might see some stocks have a big crash when valuations start to come back in the mind of investors.

Meanwhile we saw 2 big milestones for Tesla & Elon Musk yesterday as the company [passed](https://ibb.co/yXnFsbp) Facebook as market value goes as Tesla is seeing huge trading volumes as yesterday, it [traded](https://ibb.co/6BYkLP9) more shares than the next 3 big movers Apple, Alibaba and Amazon, while Elon Musk [became](https://ibb.co/xS0G5Sk) the richest man in the world, on the back of a 16% increase in Tesla stock already in 2021.

2021-01-22 00:20:00,"Stock Market News for Today | Intel [INTC], Tesla [TSLA] & Other Stock Market News [01-22]","**Stocks have a mixed day as Biden has his first full day in office. Traditional energy stocks lose some ground as we continue to see a transition to Green Energy. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news!**

**\~Long post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw a mixed day, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/RbB5Xhz) leading the way, finishing .55% up and closing at a new all-time high just like the [SP500](https://ibb.co/X5v19R6) which barely finished the day in the green, while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/Gtq5WF7) industrial lost 12 points. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/Mpbp84k) continuing to drop, but at a lower rate, as it is testing the 21 levels yet again.

Almost 60% of the companies were declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/6rnhSpQ) on below average volume, as the companies trading above the moving averages is still very high. Yesterday we also saw only 3 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/2ZbYCWp) finish in the green with Tech leading the way up over 1%, while the biggest laggard by far was the Energy sector, dropping over 3% for the day, as Large-cap growth companies were the only ones to gain [yesterday](https://ibb.co/yQNzN5b), while value plays lagged behind.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y626Sdj) from yesterday. We can see Apple had a terrific day ahead of earnings, with most of the semis also joining in the rally, while the value heavy sectors like banks, materials and utilities joined Energy in underperforming for the day.

Yesterday we also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/QFsMCkj) which revealed a further drop in bullish investors, which is music to my ears, as bearish investors saw another increase of 3%. I really hope we can get the bullish sentiment down under 38% so we can find better opportunities in the markets.

We also received other economic data yesterday, as the jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/tPmQGkd) came in 26k below last week and in-line with expectations, while continuing claims were also down over 100k to 5.05M, as we also saw the Philly [FED](https://ibb.co/YpQSMj4) coming in way better than expected while the December Housing [Starts](https://ibb.co/H7cPXfx) also came in ahead of expectations with a 5.8% increase m/m, as it doesn’t seem the housing market will cool itself soon, it just wants to go higher & higher right now.

And one last number that we saw yesterday was from [Store](https://ibb.co/TTGMFCv) Capital which announced rent collections for January standing at 91%, a 1% increase since December. This is better than I expected, as I thought they would start to have more problems, with more restriction & lockdowns happening in the cold season rather than improving the situation.

[Today](https://ibb.co/BTQDPvt) we start the day off with the PMI reading and finish mostly with energy related economic data.

In some other stock market news, we saw most of the solar [stocks](https://ibb.co/WWKvsmz) and the other green energy stocks pop yesterday after Biden signed the executive order to rejoin the climate accord and also signed a number of other orders focused on moving to a greener energy. I think this will remain a very investable theme in the next couple of years, especially if the Dems keep the control of the Congress in the next elections.

This sector also contains [Tesla](https://ibb.co/0sQv2th) which according to the most recent data saw a 63% increase y/y in vehicle registration in California, which is another good sign for the company, as they are working towards building into this high valuation, while others like [Lucid](https://ibb.co/8s42vV5) Motors are still working into getting their first production car to the market.

I think this highly flying stocks and IPOs should be taken with a lot of attention, yes, they are very interesting, but not all of them will make it to the other side (meaning the profit side), just like not all dot com companies made it. Invest wisely and diversify your portfolio to avoid significant risk.

Yesterday we also saw [Intel](https://ibb.co/vvXfTqz) beat expectations, with a beat of 40 cents on earnings and a beat of $2.5B on revenues, but did not impress with anything else, as the guidance still disappointed investors. This was the last quarter for the outgoing CEO which will be replaced in the next weeks, in a try to reimagine Intel’s path forward. The company also increased their [dividend](https://ibb.co/0DfsfnX) by 5%, probably in an attempt to keep investors motivated to hold the stock. I think Intel might eventually catch-up to their competitors somewhat, but it will take a lot of spending and time. I think you are better off investing in others like Broadcom, AMD, Micron which seem to have a plan figured out already.

So, let’s hope for a turnaround in the markets or hopefully we only see a small healthy correction as the Asia-Pacific [markets](https://ibb.co/3NQmSck) fell overnight, with the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/mNq0Cy7) also posting to a red open.

2020-09-14 10:01:45,TSLA leaks (supposedly),"At the upcoming Tesla Battery Day conference on September 22, Tesla will officially announce two million-kilometer batteries. If Tesla’s million-kilometer battery is really realized, electric vehicles will achieve a qualitative leap in mileage and battery life, and battery recycling will also become a thing of the past.

Single crystal cathode battery

Tesla single crystal cathode battery, this battery is also a lithium ion battery. It uses a new generation of single crystal NMC532 cathodes and a new brand-new electrolyte, which can enable electric vehicles to travel continuously for 1.6 million kilometers. The battery technology we are using can only maintain about 1,000 charge and discharge cycles, and this battery allows 90% of the battery's capacity to maintain a normal level after 4,000 charge and discharge cycles. Therefore, the single-cathode battery can still maintain 90% capacity after achieving 1.6 million kilometers of travel. This also means that if the battery is installed in a car, even if the whole car is scrapped, the battery can still be used.

Silicon nanowire

anode battery. The weight of the battery cell of this battery will be reduced by half, and the space occupied will be half of the current lithium ion battery. This means that with the same battery volume and quality, the energy density of the battery pack will be greatly improved. At present, the energy density of Tesla batteries is about 250Wh/kg. If this silicon nanowire anode technology is used, the energy density of Tesla batteries will reach about 400Wh/kg. At the same time, this battery has a high cycle life, and mass-produced cells are not far away. If this silicon nanowire anode battery is mass-produced and installed in a car, it may become a changer of current battery technology rules.

Tesla and the battery

As early as 2016, Tesla began funding the Tesla Canada Laboratory, which was composed of a team of scientists led by Jeff Dahn. Dann is a heavyweight in lithium-ion battery research. In more than 40 years, Dann has made many major breakthroughs in battery research. At the same time, in May 2019, Tesla spent US$218 million to acquire Maxwell, which specializes in the development of batteries and capacitors; in October 2019, Tesla acquired Hibar, the world’s number one supercapacitor manufacturer in Canada; in February 2020, SilLion acquired SilLion Inc., a lithium-ion battery company. Today, Tesla has held a number of battery core patents by hiring battery technicians and buying companies.

Summary

Tesla already has a number of new battery technologies. If the technology is mature enough, Tesla may no longer rely on Panasonic and Ningde’s battery supply in the future. Tesla battery or will subvert the entire battery industry",310,0.93

I, on the other hand, think that Elon still has a wildcard up his sleeve:  His star link service.  Imagine the vehicle can is a hot spot for all your devices or even a hot spot for your cabin in the wood whenever you visit (with your car).  With more than 12% of all drivers on the road (US) - at any given time - using the cell phone service,  TSLA can team up with a wireless provider and provide a WIFI call for their drivers for a small cut in profit (less load on cell towers).  TSLA can even make their own phone and has a phone service with minimal data/minute since WIFI callings don't count toward cell service.  That phone maybe a ""cool""  factor for the younger crowd with their mode affordable 25k EV.


The car can have a true entertainment system on long trips,  kids can play online games with their peers etc.


Auto pilot (FSD) will be more effective when the cars are connected.   For those who are not comfortable with FSD, how about a ""remote driver service"" where a professional can ""drive"" your car remotely when you need it?  


That, I don't think is priced in.",0,0.5

I sold at +25% already just a couple weeks later, and fully expected the bubble to pop after that. But it seems to still be roaring so I’m in it for another run. If I hit another +20-25%, even better.

I plan on being in this stock long term as well but I also see volatility here. It’s running because of hype, it’s bound to pop eventually. But where are the current price targets for everyone? I think that’s the most important part about knowing when to pull back.

2020-09-08 06:53:59,"All those TSLA FOMO's out there, it may be the time to get in","Every week for the past 8 weeks, I've seen non-stop posts about how people are having great FOMO on TSLA. How they wish they had gotten in at $1000, $1300, $1500, $1750, $2000.

Everyone asking about best price to get in, whether it will go higher, etc.

Well, now TSLA is down almost 40% from its ATH post-split. Pre-split it was at $2200. Then there was a 5:1 split, which drove the price to $440, at which point it rocketed up to $500 (or $2500 pre-split).

Now TSLA has cratered all the way to $340 (or $1700 pre-split). Its back at the price point it was at right after the split was announced. Its still high for some people here, but its trading at a discount from its ATH of $2500.

To all those TSLA FOMO-er's, its time to step up to their conviction. Do you believe in TSLA as the ""company of the future"" that has a valuation potential that can't be captured (ie. ARKK's perspective, and hence their $7000 pre-split price target potential).

Added fun: AMD, BA, MSFT, AAPL are all hammered right now. Again, these are all stocks that I've seen people have incredible FOMO about missing the August run up. If you genuinely believe these stocks have a future, and are thinking long term (ie. over 1 year holdings), these price points are good entries for a DCA strategy. Basically, all these stocks gave up ALL their August gains, which means if you missed the boat at the end of July, nows the time to get back in because the train came back to the station.

If you believe the valuations of these stocks are still too high, then feel free to disregard this entire post.

However I remember back in April I was contemplating whether to buy TSLA stocks and I felt like the price was already very high and I didn’t like that Elon as a CEO put out some controversial tweets etc.
I just thought it was no wise investment back then.
When I see that now it is 500% up... well you can imagine my frustration.

Now I realise that I’m very very late to the party. But is it too late?

2020-12-09 12:26:07,$TSLA - Short Term Buyers/Sellers,"I made a stupid move... Monday I bought at $627, and was happy that it climbed to $654. Then JP Morgan pulled the rug out from under us today with that analyst who I really don’t believe. I really wonder if they just wanted to discount the stock before buying shares.

Anyways... onto my stupid move... I got nervous and bailed at $600 or whatever. Then watched it hit the resistance at $600 and come back. I repurchased at $615, triggering a wash now at $641. And it fell to $605 right after. Now it’s around $609.

I know TSLA is higher value, so it will fluctuate more than a few dollars at a time. I already realized that maybe I should have just bailed and saved myself the stress, but it is what it is. This is actually the second time this happened this quarter already. Last time I ended up holding for 2 months and sold for +25% in the end once balanced with that first wash sale.

The real question, where do we see this going? I know the bulls and bears are fighting, but realistically where do people see this going?

As a short term trader, I’m thinking I want out no matter what by Friday the 18th. The 21st (the day they’re added to the S&P 500) could be a real free fall. Who knows.

2020-12-09 10:34:41,TSLA or THCB?,"This got auto deleted the first time, so I'll try to make it more in depth this time. 

I have 2 trades I'm considering right now: $1000 into a short term TSLA call, or that same $1000 into THCB.

Obviously if I go TSLA calls I'm looking for a quick turnaround, and while there's a lot of risk involved in something like this normally, TSLA is on such a run right now I'm pretty confident that, at the very least, I won't lose money. 

On the other hand, THCB is looking promising, but would be a longer play. Not even speculation really. The problem I have here is that I can't find any information on the merger with Microvast, other than that it might happen Q1 of next year. I don't really know how much of a gamble this is. 

So I'm looking for advice on which way to go with my money, or if I should look elsewhere altogether. Anyone know the risks involved with THCB?",10,0.79
2020-08-21 21:43:40,"Since the stock split announcement, every minute you spend asking reddit if you should buy TSLA, you lose $0.17.","On average TSLA has gone up $67.1/day since the announcement of the stock split. Market hours are open 6.5 hours each day. Each hour is about $10.32 so for every minute you spend asking reddit if you should buy, you’ve lost $0.17/share. Don’t question the meme stock. It actually has a product that is in high demand and the stock went nowhere in the previous 10 years (floated around $100-400) and at the time, it was undervalued because 99% of people didn’t understand it.

Edit: this post is NOT suggesting to buy now. But it’s also not suggesting to sell or wait for the dip to buy either. Make your own decisions. The risk is very high. If you invest now, it could go up another 5-10% to only drop 30%. No one knows at this point. There’s a lot of catalysts coming up in September like battery day and Q3 earnings. Don’t be surprised if we see a sell off before or immediately after. There’s very high expectations for the million mile battery.

2020-12-27 10:14:50,CALLING ALL TSLA & BTC FAN BOYS,"I’m going to try to make this as short as possible so I’ll get right into it;

I’m currently a 20 year old university student who since starting to invest back in February 2020 has managed to accumulate 27 TSLA shares and 1.2 BTC. My current situation that I’m in is that I’m wondering if I should sell a portion of my TSLA position (perhaps 7 shares or more ?) to fund further BTC purchases.

Let me start off by saying I am a huge fan of TSLA and Elon and have been since last year, I know the ins and outs of this company and plan to hold and buy more Tesla till I’m 60 years old. The thing is while I know that TSLA will revolutionize the entire automotive industry, Bitcoin on the other hand in my opinion has the potential to revolutionize the entire global monetary system. We are on the cusp of the gates of institutional investments flooding open within the next year with huge corporations such as SQ and Microstrategy taking it onto their balance sheets. I truly believe in a $100k BTC by 2022. 

I’m making aprox 150% return on both asset classes atm. But my thought process for selling TSLA for BTC is not just solely for monetary gain. I truly believe we are so early in bitcoins life time, I mean look around 99% of people don’t even understand the technology or how revolutionary it is. I think while I do have the ability to do so I should own as many BTC as I can since we are only at the start.

Hey everyone and Welcome so let’s start with the recap of what has happened in the stock market since Monday.

Monday the [DOW](https://ibb.co/ryHzJ3C) rose by more than 1,12% with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/PG8CcgX) also gaining more than half a percent while the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/Qfwj6QX) was the laggard barely up 0,2% to finish the day while The [VIX](https://ibb.co/SdCNtBZ) had another big drop closing at 22.2. About 70% of the companies were gaining while 80% were trading over 50 and 200-day moving averages. The stock market was lead by the energy sector, which saw a major spike of almost 5% with Financials and Industrials also up more than 1% for the day. The rally was pushed mostly by small and mid-cap value stocks while large-cap growth companies were lagging as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/Kbvv08B) with the biggest company in the world, Apple, dragging down the sector, down almost 3% for the day. [CHART](https://ibb.co/LSxy7Mj) / [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/ZHYXxRW) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/pynTjjH)

Reports also came in on Monday that the PS5 and the new xBox have been sold out the moment they are available in stock, as the two gaming consoles are enjoying great demand, this bolds well for the parent companies Sony and Microsoft especially if they can keep up with the demand for this holiday season including Black Friday, holiday [RETAIL SALES](https://ibb.co/J2vDV3F) are forecasted to rise between 3,6 and 5,2%. [XBOX & PS5 NEWS](https://ibb.co/qFMvRz5)

All this while Europe will start to re-open again after a contraction of the economy due to the latest lockdowns. As they saw the Eurozone PMI falling by almost 4% in October. [EUROZONE NEWS](https://ibb.co/8DFqbd7)

Some good news came from [STORE CAPITAL](https://ibb.co/rHy6pGj) as the rent collections for November remained at 90% with no new tenants requiring deferrals, this suggests that companies are managing to survive even with the current restrictions in place.

We also saw reports that Janet Yellen will be the next Treasury pick as she would become the first person to be at the top of the FED the White House Council of Economic Advisers and the Treasury and she will become the first woman to lead the Treasury. [TREASURY NEWS](https://ibb.co/bRyZk8G)

Moving on, Tuesday we saw the [DOW](https://ibb.co/K0SW54V) spike more than 1,5%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/8j7WcXs) rising 1,6% and the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/S7D4MJ3) up more than 1,3% in what was a very good day for the stock market with more than 70% of companies advancing and 167 new highs on above average volume. The leaders were once again Energy and Financials, as this 2 sectors, will be two of the fastest benefiting from the end of the pandemic. The rally was continued with value companies leading the way for the 2nd straight day. You can struggle to find red spots in the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/FgNk2rg)  from Tuesday but there were a few in healthcare and real estate. This was the first time that the [DOW](https://ibb.co/C7dYJVD) closed over 30k. [CHART](https://ibb.co/FHmJRYw) / [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/C2WXYW6) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/S5DbTNV)

[NIKOLA](https://ibb.co/M15WTJ4) stock tumbled after the recent rally as the GM deal seems less likely every day, as the deadline for the deal is December 3rd.

While October [HOME SEARCHES](https://ibb.co/8PVX9KT) surged over 200% as a Redfin report shows, this leads me to believe that the strong housing demand will keep remaining at this levels for a good period of time. 

On Wednesday we saw the stock market take a breather, as the [DOW](https://ibb.co/0f0Xt8g) lost 0,6%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/LYdGYSz) lost 0,16% while the pandemic plays regained some momentum with the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/37Y7qGX) being up almost half a percent before the stock market closed for Thanksgiving.

About 54% of companies were losing ground with below average volume for the day, as Technology and consumer discretionary and staples were the gainers for the day. Value plays did see some normal corrections after the huge gains in the last days as investors were cashing out some money probably before the day off. [CHART](https://ibb.co/pW4g7g4) / [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/ZJxg1MW) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/zhGhJMB)

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/PDyDqBb) from Wednesday as only a couple of companies Like Amazon, Apple, Nvidia and Shopify were gaining, while the energy sector was the biggest laggard.

Also the AAII investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/CM9RsDQ) from Wednesday showed that people are getting more bearish or bullish as the neutral feeling fell way below the historical average as bullishness remains very high. This is usually a contrarian indicator, as more bullishness gives me reason to take profits and bearishness to invest in the stock market, though I don’t have the same confidence in this as in the past, as I expect this market rally to last until the end of next year.

News came in from Delta Airlines as pilots approved pay cuts and lower guaranteed hours that could avoid more than 1700 pilots getting cut off. This are great news both for the company and the pilots, as air travel will pick up again in the next years. [DELTA NEWS](https://ibb.co/PmHQMDf)

Also, Deere reported blowout [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/z4C2L6S) and a beat of more than 1$ per share and a revenue only 0,6% below last year while also issuing strong 2021 forecasts as they see the equipment sales climbing more than 10% compared to 2020 with a strong net income guidance of 3,6 to 4 billion $ compared to the May guidance of 1,6 to 2 billion $. [4Q 2020](https://ibb.co/FKNjHKs) / [2021](https://ibb.co/PT8GhBW)

We closed the week on a short day on Friday as the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/8PXVwTT) led the way up 0,93%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/6Pgyrd9) up 0,24% and the [DOW](https://ibb.co/82j8ft0) barely up 0,13%. As we saw about 55% of the companies advancing on way below average volume due to the short day of trading with 85% of companies trading below average volumes. Friday was a pretty divided day as Health Care and Tech lead the way while Utilities and Energy saw a slight pullback after the big gains this week. [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/s3n9Sdb) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/Ldx38vW) / 

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/TggK0j5) from Friday as we see that the market was dragged higher by the big tech companies and communication services while the rest of the market was pretty much lagging.

So for the week, the Nasdaq lead the way up 3% and closed at the 45th record of 2020, the SP followed up 2,3% and closed a 26th record of the year with the DOW also rising 2% in this shortened week. While the [VIX](https://ibb.co/n6M1Z9k) closed the week just below 21, at the lowest level since February.

So great signs for the recovery of the economy still popped up almost every day, as the stock market is more forward looking than it is a reflection of the current economic conditions. As November will likely be the 7th straight month of job gains, though they will be the fewest in number since the recovery of jobs has begun. [NOVEMBER JOBS](https://ibb.co/ZVMDxtr)

Also, Bitcoin has seen its price drop from almost all-time highs at 19,5k down more than 3k before bouncing back to around 17k. The cryptocurrency was due for a correction as it had seen a huge rally in since Labor Day and this correction came as news popped of the Treasury attempting to rush out regulation on crypto-wallets. This would be a big negative factor for people who own Bitcoin not for just it’s value but for using it also. But we will have to wait and see as the Treasury boss will be replaced when the Presidency changes. [BITCOIN NEWS](https://ibb.co/FhpVSjC) / [BITCOIN CHART](https://ibb.co/myVqJzN)

Some company news from Friday were that [PALANTIR](https://ibb.co/hDMN8vz) saw it’s stock plunge from all time high of 33,5$ to 27,6$ after Citron tweeted that they are shorting the stock with a 20$ price target. This are common tactics that short sellers use in my opinion to get the fast results they expected. Citron also got into a short position on NIO recently and that news also made the stock take a plunged but that has since recovered and even made new all time highs since.

Great news came for sports betting companies like DraftKings and Penn national as Canada seems to be going the same way as the US as legalizing sports betting advances more and more. [CANADA NEWS](https://ibb.co/6F20V4W)

Also, Tesla has seen a huge spike in the last weeks since the SP500 news, and the stock might see another spike as Musk [TWEETED](https://ibb.co/qyLQXRp) that the full self-driving feature will be released wider in the next weeks as the company finally approaches the end of software development as they collect more and more data. Tesla has surpassed Berkshire and is now the 6th largest company in the US as the stock is up more than 600% year to date making Elon Musk the second richest person in the world behind only Bezos. The company will go into the SP500 index at about 80% of its total market value cap as the index only counts the free-floating shares. I believe we won’t see such a big spike in price when the company will be added to the SP in December, just like it happened with the stock split its more of a buy the news sell the event type of thing. As I expected the stock jumped over the previous all time highs and it might see a little correction when the event actually happens, but in the long run this a company that I will continue to own in my portfolio. [TESLA CHART](https://ibb.co/S3w4YVD) / [MUSK WEALTH](https://ibb.co/b6xRMZL) / 

Next week we will have some interesting earnings reports that I expect to beat the estimates from companies like [NEXT WEEK EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/6yNcM9m)

[AUTOHOME](https://ibb.co/nQ08V04) which is a company that has great potential as it trades at a low P/E, they offer leads and services for auto consumers in China and they have a very wide consumer base to spread to.

With [ZOOM](https://ibb.co/br3pPJC) also expecting to report on Monday after the close, I recently just sold out of my position in Zoom. I think there is too much positive expectations for the company as it trade at almost 200 times earnings per shares.

Also, [Salesforce](https://ibb.co/D5dwYYW) are expected to announce earnings on Tuesday, as the company saw it’s stock tumble after the news of a possible acquiring of Slack. In the long run that will be a very good play for the company as they have continued to buy more and more companies that allows them to keep growing.

Other companies that are reporting and are very interesting to watch are [CrowdStrike](https://ibb.co/X3YBpqN) and [OKTA](https://ibb.co/rGLJtPW) also on Tuesday with [DocuSign](https://ibb.co/vvmSw3p) , [Dollar General](https://ibb.co/23YQzcg), [Marvell](https://ibb.co/nfbYcgG) and Snowflake reporting on Wednesday.

Good news came this Saturday for online retailers as sales jumped more than 20% on Black Friday and are expected to grow between 15 and 35% tomorrow as Cyber Monday may set a new record for online sales.  [RETAIL EXPECTATIONS](https://ibb.co/QFbmcPD)

Here are the most important economic data that we are looking for in the next week as it will be a week full of numbers that may impact how the stock market reacts in the near future. Hopefully we will see an improvement in PMI and a decrease in jobless claims and many more improvments. [NEXT WEEK ECONOMIC DATA](https://ibb.co/DYp3LyP)

2020-12-11 07:27:08,Short returns on TSLA?,"Advice for beginners

Hey guys, so I recently started investing this year amid the pandemic and am looking for some advice. I’m a student in my early 20s with bills so budget is tight but I figured it’s better to start building a financial base earlier rather than later. I started with around 400 that I was prepared to lose entirely, but with a little research and gambling I’ve been banking in on the short returns since about September in TSLA. I continued buying and selling in short increments, along with purchasing shares at low points while holding my previous investments. I currently have almost  1k invested and am looking for any input from some folks more knowledgeable on this than I am. Should I be wary of buying and selling frequently or day trading? Is this stock gonna hit the dirt in the next few weeks? (Beginner so please excuse improper grammar/phrasing)",2,1.0

2020-11-26 00:55:49,An Explanation of $TSLA's Recent Surge,"[Barron has an excellent article on why Tesla has been surging of recent](https://archive.is/bI3Ka#selection-1409.9-1409.68).

The rise in $TSLA since the S&P 500 inclusion announcement is disconnected from Tesla's fundamentals and $TSLA has been behaving more like an independent commodity. Essentially speaking, it's an issue of demand and supply.

The S&P 500 index funds have to buy Tesla regardless of its price when it gets added to the index. Around $4.6 trillion is directly indexed to the S&P 500. This has created a phenomenon of rising demand for $TSLA.  The supply has so far remained fixed. Whatever price you buy $TSLA for now, you can sell it to the index funds (even if the price is higher) from December 18. But wait, it doesn't stop there.

The higher $TSLA rises, the more of Tesla's float index funds would have to buy. The more of Tesla's float index funds would have to buy, the higher $TSLA would get bid up. This has created a positive feedback loop driving Tesla's share prices higher. *The higher $TSLA rises, the higher $TSLA will rise*. There is no obvious place this stops as the index funds **have to buy** $TSLA. Something that might break the positive feedback loop is if Tesla issued new shares. An increase in supply with the same level of demand would drive the price down.

In the 7 trading days since the S&P 500 inclusion announcement, $TSLA has risen on all but one of them and has appreciated 40%. When the S&P 500 announced Tesla's inclusion, index funds needed to buy only $51 billion, now Barron estimates they need to buy around $70 billion worth of $TSLA and 2 million extra shares.

The good news (or bad news for some $TSLA speculators) is that reason would return to $TSLA's price post December 21. The speculators would sell off the $TSLA they bought to the index funds, and the crazy feedback loop would end. However, that wouldn't necessarily be all. Indexers only need to buy a fixed amount of $TSLA. If the speculators overbought $TSLA (bought more $TSLA than the index funds need), they would find that they are unable to sell all their $TSLA to the index funds. They would be left holding the bag so to speak. These speculators may then try to get rid of the $TSLA they have by setting even lower bid prices, and this should drive the price down. **The extent to which speculators overbought $TSLA relative to the demand from indexers and benchmarkers would determine the drop in $TSLA post December 21.**

If you want to short $TSLA, I think short term puts bought on December 21 would be sensible. $TSLA should drop after December 21. It's not clear how far the drop would be, but there would likely be some drop. Before then, for a brief moment in time, Tesla would be the US' sixth or fifth most valuable company and Musk might be the world's richest man.",15,0.79
2020-11-27 06:28:45,"TSLA, the most valuable car company in the world due to its Reddit meme stock pump success, is recalling Model X & Model Y SUV's on safety concerns (steering control can fall apart)","A cosmetic design feature and quality control in construction flaws can lead to steering control mechanisms coming apart while driving. 

Tesla is known for its production quality issues and is currently ranked the second worst car for quality in some rankings. In the [11/19/2020 Consumer Reports, TSLA sank in reliability ratings to second to last](https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2020/11/19/tesla-reliability-sinks-in-consumer-reports-annual-survey/?sh=49e829275fbb), just above Ford Lincoln's bottom place. 

The poor quality of TSLA's construction appears to have not been improved by Elon Musk and TSLA receiving vast injections of capital in 2020 via its stock valuations that elevated TSLA and Musk to most wealthy status.

2020-11-06 13:20:54,New Tesla ($TSLA) bull: Any quirks I should be aware of?,"Just became a Tesla bull today.  I have read over the fundamentals (with a very critical eye, I might add) and the technicals in reaching my conclusion.

However, I am just wondering if there are any quirks about Tesla that I should know about, such as non-earnings reports days to note, seasonality, or odd occurrences or price movements that tend to happen from time to time.

Based on my research I know about the following:

* TSLA tends to be volatile, so don't overreact 

* Elon Musk tweets random stuff sometimes.  Don't overreact to it

* Once a year, they have a Battery Day.  This year's Battery Day is already past.

* TSLA should be valued as a tech company rather than a car company.  i.e. Treat it more like AAPL than GM.",8,0.61

D) NIO is the biggest EV company in china and was recently given 1.5 billion credit from chinese banks and recent production reports have been positive

E) anecdotally, I believe china likes monopolies because it's easier for them to control. So signs point to NIO being the one they back

I've heard numbers like $50B worth of stock needs to be purchased for the index fund and all other pensions etc that mimic the sp500. 

 When it's Dec 24, is there just a marker order placed for X amount of stock?  That last fill would be at $1000 I would think.  I know there is market float of some shares to ease the transition, but I can see that being depleted so quickly.  

If someone is buying, there has to be someone selling...  It seems in my small mind, who would ever sell shares before the entry?  Until that influx of new shares hits, it can only go one direction and I would the hedge funds trying to manipulate it down would be too risky that another pension would gobble the shares up for better entry when they know they have to purchase them before the entry date.

2021-03-06 01:51:07,Tesla breaks a record: The biggest six-week drop in value ever,"""Tesla and  founder Elon Musk are renowned for notching firsts. In 2012, the EV-maker unveiled the first-ever premium all-electric sedan, the Model S. Six years later, Musk’s SpaceX launched the world’s most powerful rocket, the Falcon Heavy. That milestone marked another first, since the Falcon carried the Tesla Roadster into space, making the pioneering EV the first auto ever to orbit the Earth.

Recently, Musk has set supersonic financial records. Tesla’s moonshot from a market cap of $30 billion in mid-April of last year to $849 billion on Jan. 26 dwarfs the leap of any other young comer on the rise in a nine-month span. By early January, Tesla’s rise had lifted Musk’s net worth to $185 billion, placing the Tesla founder on a new pedestal as the world’s richest person.

Musk just achieved a new financial first––for the stock losing the most value ever in a brief period. Since that late January peak, Tesla’s valuation has cratered by 36%, dropping by $305 billion to $544 billion at mid-morning on March 5, as its shares tumbled from $883 to $566. No company in the annals of equity markets has ever dropped on a scale remotely that big in just five and a half weeks. Tesla’s $300 billion–plus descent exceeds the market caps of all but the 16 most valuable companies in the S&P 500. Tesla dropped by far more than twice the combined market caps of Ford and General Motors, and by $100 billion more than that of the world’s second most valuable automaker, Toyota.

It may reassure Tesla bulls that it’s been a highly volatile stock in the past: It has seen big drops and then always recovered to shoot beyond previous peaks. From mid-February to mid-March of last year, it shed half its value and in the first two weeks of September, fell 34%, only to roar back on both occasions. The September slump shaved $186 billion from its valuation, but Tesla got it all back, and $400 billion more in the months ahead. Sure, you’ll hear, Tesla will suffer big bumps along the way, but its long-term trajectory will trace a sharp upward climb.
Still, the 34% decline means that Tesla’s shares need to rebound 56% to regain their old peak of $883 (and valuation of $849 billion). Overnight, investors decided that Tesla will earn a lot less than they foresaw as recently as late January.

What’s driving Tesla’s big pullback?

Let’s assume shareholders will want at least a 10% annual return in exchange for what can be counted on as a wild ride. To get there as of late January, Tesla needed to be worth $2.2 trillion by early 2031. At a premium price-to-earnings multiple of 30, Tesla would be generating $73 billion in yearly GAAP net earnings. That’s $5 billion more than Apple, by far the biggest profit spinner in the S&P, made last year.

Now, shareholders have lowered the bar––but that bar remains dauntingly high. Using the same formula, the bogey is now $1.44 trillion 10 years from now, and earnings would need to reach $48 billion. To get there, Tesla’s 2020 profits of $721 million have to grow at an annual pace of around 50%.
That Tesla suffered such a huge fall, so fast, highlights the extreme uncertainty in assessing what it’s really worth. In reality, investors have little or no idea how much Tesla will earn in the future. Will the number be $60 billion in 2031 or $10 billion, something lower than that or something in between? Making any reasonable estimate requires so many assumptions that the exercise is futile. What remains is a super-sexy product, a charismatic CEO, a cult following, and a great narrative. What also remains is a still-giant valuation that can only go higher if great numbers start coming in, and fast. Otherwise, Tesla is sitting on an air pocket whose deflation would set new records unlikely ever to be equaled.""

2020-07-08 15:56:35,My 1 year TSLA ride and how I DCA out of my position.,"Hi all. Today I officially closed out my Tesla position at least for the time being. For me the price has gotten to high for my personal comfort level so I sold my last 2 shares and I feel fine about it. Here is a story of my 1 year ride on the Tesla coaster. 

My first purchase was 5 shares back in June of 2019 @ a price of $220 a share. I work in the solar industry and was seeing how many power walls my company was installing to pair with solar projects. I also was noticing more and more Tesla's on the road and this is what swayed my decision to jump into what at the time was considered a bad stock. By July the stock was up to $260 and I was feeling great about my investment. Earning were just around the corner so I decided to hold and see what happens. It did not go well. The stock dropped right back to my purchase price and even dipped below a few times. I stuck with it because I believed in the company and my position never got to -10% which is a rule I try to follow and cut loses there. Thank good I stuck with it because we all know what happened from there. October earnings hit and the price jumped and continued to climb. 

My next purchase was 1 share @ $354 in late November. Next quarter earnings come out and that's when things really got crazy. By January I was over 100% return on my investment. This is where I made my first sale. I sold 3 shares or half my position @ $479 a share and essentially took all my risk off the table. This is a strategy I always take with any stock that has a 100% return. I've been lucky in the 10ish years I've been investing to have had that opportunity several times. It helps that I started investing in the greatest bull marker ever but I also did my research, learned from past mistakes, and tried not to repeat those mistakes. 

My next sale was 1 Share @ $731 in early February. This locked in official profit but also left me with 2 shares to wait and see if this rocket ship would continue. Covid hit and the market dived. However it was very easy for me to sit and watch as my Tesla shares went from $900 to $400 because I had already made money on the trade. Had I been smart I would have bought back in and rode the wave again but I had decided to put most of my profits into QQQ and I also wasn't sure the selling was over. 

Today after seeing the crazy run Tesla has been on I decided to end this adventure for now and sold my last 2 shares @ $1393. This put my total profit on this trade at $3,493 minus some small commissions.  

My average purchase price was approx $243 and my average sale price was $825. Sure had I've had the guts to keep all 6 shares I would have done even better but for me I feel much better reducing my exposure as a stock climbs that rapidly. 

I see lots of post on here about DCA into a stock but not many on DCA out which to me is a great strategy as well. It's incredibly hard to nail to perfect time to get into a position and it's just as hard to decide the perfect time to get out. DCA both ways for me takes away some of that FOMO especially if you have already locked in 100% gains.

Hope you enjoyed my story. Keep learning, keep investing.",245,0.88

2020-08-26 14:14:37,Is it too late for TSLA?,"So I know this is all people probably see on this subreddit, but I feel like this is a step above a noobies post (lol probably not)

So I’ve been pondering for months, do I buy tesla ? And I’ve been thinking this every day since it was at $400 at the crash and every day it just gets higher and higher.

Today I went to buy in as abit of a YOLO, but the market just closed and my order didn’t go through.

After chatting to my old man (Dad) he believes i’m just chasing after what I have missed out on and really just running into the FOMO trap. 

I still want to buy in but I’m not sure to buy in pre-split and look to liquidate some of the position straight away or buy post split with the price potentially being Inflated. 

My feeling is that after the split a lot of people will look to liquidate some of there positions to earn some profit after holding for so long, therefore dipping the price abit. 

However being tesla who even knows anymore, it just feels like it’s going up and will never stop 🚀

But who knows, might just expand my position on NIO at this point - see if it’s the new TSLA

I’d be interested to see other peoples feelings and if anyone else is having these thoughts",5,0.59

Last Friday, I was looking to swing trade and TSLA seemed an like a great candidate for that purpose. I bought 9 shares when it had dipped to $1430/share on Friday with hopes it climbs up to $1490 and makes a quick profit. Come Monday, TSLA dipped again to the $1370's and I was getting worried.

 A record half-billion dollar redemption from Ark Invest's flagship fund in a single day has led analysts to highlight the risks arising from the ETF's heavy exposure to illiquid stocks if outflows pick up pace.

Investors yanked $465 million from Ark Innovation on Monday, according to Refinitiv data. More such redemptions would prompt Wood's fund to sell liquid holdings to manage the squeeze in the near-term before looking to unwind its illiquid holdings.

Ark Invest meanwhile shuffled its portfolio on Tuesday by cutting its already-tiny holdings in Apple, Amazon, Taiwan Semiconductor and Google-owner Alphabet to beef-up its Tesla stake on Wednesday.

This is one of the problem that ark funds is trying to mitigate. Many people are very bullish and saying they are 50 to 70% into the ark funds, but they don't even know what stocks are inside these funds. People please realize that ark funds are high risk high return funds, so you should only invest a reasonable % of your portfolio into these funds.

**What is Cloudflare?**

Cloudflare is going to make a leading player in next-generation computing. From their blog: [https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/). Excerpt:

>“Imagine you’re the maintainer of a high-traffic media website, and your DNS is already hosted on Cloudflare.  
>  
>Page speed is critical. You need to get content to your audience as quickly as possible on every device. You also need to render ads in a speedy way to maintain a good user experience and make money to support your journalism...  you’re going to need to pay for some beefy servers to be able to handle spikes in traffic and respond to requests in a timely manner...Cloudflare Workers allow you to run your code on the edge quickly, efficiently and at scale. Instead of paying for a server to host your code, you can host it directly inside the datacenter”

Seriously, this is cool, and it’s only beginning. Cloudflare is innovating every day. Their customers absolutely love them. As a software engineer, they have already have some products are there that are pretty cool like Cloudflare Pages and Cloudflare Workers. I think what’s going to help them into a powerhouse is this:

&#x200B;

>Over the coming months, we’ll be working on integrating Workers and Pages into a seamless experience. It’ll work the exact same way Pages does: just write your code, git push, and we’ll deploy it for you. The only difference is, it won’t just be your frontend, it’ll be your backend, too. And just to be clear: this is not just for stateless functions. With Workers KV and Durable Objects, we see a huge opportunity to really enable any web application to be built on this platform.

Soon, developers will be able to make full-stack applications end-to-end using Cloudflare’s network. Cloudflare will handle all of the annoying stuff about development including hosting and deployment. And they’ll allow developers of all size to instantly scale their application across the entire United States, all while increasing developer productivity and satisfaction.

If you’re not a developer, you probably didn’t understand most of that, but essentially, they’re making it so you can build entire applications using solely their infrastructure. This is actually genuinely cool, and will save the average developer tons of time and money.

I can easily see how this propels their growth even faster than 50%. And if this thing inches up to 60-65% YoY as it expands it’s profitability... 🚀🚀🚀

(And even if it doesn’t, and stays at 50%, it will still 🚀 but slower. Regardless, it’s going up)

&#x200B;

\---

“BuT iT tAnKeD oN EaRnInGs”

That drop is an absolute blessing to those who aren’t long. Plus it’s hardly a tank when it’s at ATHs if you exclude the one week in its history where it was higher

Its earnings was good, and to those who haven’t read it, [do so](https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2021/cloudflare-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-financial-results/) besides relying on a stock’s immediate reaction. To the 90% who will completely ignore that sentence:

>Revenue growth was 50% YOY which is consistent with the last 3 earnings

&#x200B;

Revenue right now is $125 million **per quarter**  or $431 million for 2020. Doesn’t sound like much at first, but those of us know the power of compound interest knows how fast that number will be pumped. 5 years from now, that’s $1 billion a a quarter or 4 million a year. In 8 it will be $3 billion/quarter or 12 billion a year

Yes, 5-8 years is a long time. This is a buy and hold stock. That’s why I’m long Jan 21 115c.

The revenue and growth isn’t the impressive part. The margins are

>GAAP gross profit was $96.9 million, or 76.9% gross margin, compared to $65.7 million, or 78.3%, in the fourth quarter of 2019.

High 70s margins is absolutely incredible. And it's consistent quarter to quarter. That means once NET does reach profitability, they’re going to be **raking** in dough

That being said, NET isn’t profitable yet, which is pretty much the only argument bears can muster (that and high valuation but more on that later). Keep in mind they’ve been screeching the same thing since 2019 and that hasn’t stopped it. But once profitability is out of the way, there’s nothing stopping it from being a $300 stock. Here’s why:

\- Like I mentioned earlier, their losses are decreasing and if my hypothesis is correct, they will reach profitability by early ‘22

\- Currently 15% of the internet goes through Cloudflare’s network and that number is increasing. Literally, 1/6th of the entire internet infrastructure is worth $25 billion. In comparison, a bike company (PTON) is worth double that.

\- Boomer companies who need to replace their shitty infrastructure will likely turn to Cloudflare due to their reliable secure networks with guaranteed security. Not to mention their prices are dirt-cheap compared to their competitors.

&#x200B;

—-

**CONS**

The only cons are people concerned with profitability (covered already) and evaluation (priced at 60x sales which tbf is absolutely outrageous). However I think this is still short-sighted. As long as the bull market remains intact (big IF, but I’m a bull so as long interest rates are 0), there’s no reason to believe the rocket rally will end. As we see with SHOP and TSLA, traditional valuations don’t matter if the product has a dream, vision, and story, which with Cloudflare’s “Build a Better Internet” shtick, I think it does. Especially because customers actually like their product and Cloudflare will continue to innovate and build upon Cloudflare’s already enormous Cloudflare network.

This stock already got [multiple](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/cloudflare-drops-despite-multiple-price-target-upgrades) analysts upgrades. The drop was a blessing to those who aren’t in. Start investing in quality and innovation; $85/share is a whole lot less than $300 which is where they will be by 2025 (I want to say 2022, but I’m trying to be conservative here).

Seriously, give this a second look. I’ve been playing NET since 37. It’s a shit stock that consolidates for months, then rockets 30% in a week. Earnings being great (and not excellent) is the only reason NET hasn’t done its 30% move. I’m completely assured that it will soon

2021-03-15 06:31:45,Ford ($F) - Ugly Duckling to Golden Goose,"# Overview

For much of its’ history, Ford ($F) has been a boring dividend stock, yielding between 5% and 10% per year and generally languishing between $5 and $15 a share. Not exactly an inspiring story of growth or innovation. In a sector that hosts charismatic CEOs, exciting newcomers, and glossy new entrants to the industry, selling people on Ford’s potential certainly seems like an uphill battle. I mean… just look at this chart, Ford hasn’t had meaningful sustained price movement since 00-01, and that was in the wrong direction.

I would like you to forget what you think you know about Ford and begin to look at them in a new light. Ford is no longer the ugly girl at the dance or the fat kid in gym class, but rather Ryan Reynolds in *Just Friends* or Laney Boggs in *She’s All That*. To understand why I think Ford is the most compelling value opportunity in the auto sector today, we’re going to have to look at its maneuverings over the last 3-4 years.

# New Leadership, New Vision

**$11B Restructuring Plan**

In October of 2020, Ford hired its’ new [CEO Jim Farley](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/people/james-d--farley--jr-.html) who had previously held the title of COO within the company. Farley was the architect behind the company’s [$11B restructuring plan](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/11/26/ford-statement-on-business-transformation.html) that it announced in June of 2018, and it has only accelerated its’ pace under his guidance. By most estimates Ford is about halfway through its plan to restructure the company, which primarily involves cuts to unprofitable sectors and refocusing on profitable ones, as well as investment in future technologies.

**Trimming of Fat**

Ford has made a few major moves to shore up losses it was incurring in unprofitable arms of the business. The first, and one which you are probably already aware of, is the discontinuation of many of its sedan lineup in North America. In the middle of 2018, Ford announced that it would be [eliminating the Taurus, Fiesta, Fusion, C-Max, and Focus sedans](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2018/04/25/ford-cutting-car-lineup-earnings/34244867/) from their lineup moving forward. The estimated operating cost savings was $25.5B through 2022, and Ford announced that they would be focusing on their more profitable SUV and pick-up models moving forward.

Ford also announced in 2021 that it would be largely [exiting the South American market](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/01/11/ford-advances-south-america-restructuring.html), which hadn’t turned a profit since 2012 and in fact accounted for over $5B in losses during that period. They would continue operating at small-scale producing their popular Ranger pick-up and commercial vans but with the closure of their main manufacturing facility in Brazil, Ford finally cut bait in a difficult market for most traditional automakers.

Ford Europe had a [major redesign](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2019/06/27/ford-looks-to-the-future-in-europe--business-redesigned-for-prof.html) under Farley when he was President of Global Markets, slashing underperforming models from its lineup and refocusing on its highly profitable commercial vehicles as well as increasing imports of its iconic models. They also announced a [strong shift toward EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2021/02/17/ford-europe-goes-all-in-on-evs-on-road-to-sustainable-profitabil.html) with the goal of selling only electric vehicles in Europe by 2030.

**EV Investment**

Here is the section everyone is interested in, and one which GM rightly received a lot of hype for when they announced a [plan to spend $27B on developing EVs](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/gm-accelerating-ev-plans-with-additional-7-billion-announces-new-pickup.html) and autonomous vehicles by 2025. After that announcement, GM was viewed by many as the front-runner for EVs among traditional automakers. Not to be outdone, Ford announced a [$29B investment in EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/04/ford-raises-planned-investment-ev-av-leadership.html) and autonomous vehicles to be spent by 2025. To date, that is the third largest investment in EVs in the world, only falling short of the $86B and $87B investments by the mega-conglomerates VW and HMG respectively.

**Revival of Valuable IP**

In the last few years, Ford has refocused much of their business on their greatest hits. They’ve cut unpopular IP from their lineup and re-released the Bronco as well as reworked the Mustang into a crossover EV. In my opinion, this demonstrates a greater understanding of their markets and how to capitalize on their most valuable asset, which is their IP. Their most profitable model, the F-150, will be released as an EV in 2022 or 2023, and I expect that the Bronco will also see an EV model in the next few years as well. I believe that Ford has become a leaner and more focused company within the last 3 years and is set to continue their dominance in pick-ups as well as siphon significant market share in the EV and SUV spaces.

# The Power of Partnerships

**Ford, VW, and Argo**

Ford, along with fellow automotive titan Volkswagen Group, have both taken [large stakes](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2020/06/02/volkswagen-investment-argo-ai-ford-self-driving.html) in a company dedicated to autonomous driving software called Argo AI. Partnering with a company with considerable resources like VW takes some of the pressure off of Ford to develop this technology solo. While there haven’t been too many details released about this partnership or the progress being made by Argo AI, it is reassuring to know that Ford is actively invested in developing autonomous driving along with another industry leader in VW.

**Ford and Google**

In February of 2021, Ford and Google announced a [partnership](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html) to place Google’s software and technology in all of Ford’s new vehicles beginning in 2023. The operating platform in these new vehicles will be based off of the Android platform and all new vehicles will come equipped with Alphabet products like Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Assistant, and the Play Store. The addition of a familiar and established operating system like Android will give Ford vehicles a competitive edge over other automakers who try to create and implement their own subpar operating software (\*cough\* Toyota \*cough\*).

**Ford and Rivian**

Ford made headlines in April 2019 when they invested in Rivian for an undisclosed stake. What is clear from statements made by both CEO’s at the time is that the investment was both for equity as well as a strategic partnership. A planned vehicle by Ford, which has yet to be announced, will be built on Rivian’s unique [“skateboard”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2019/04/24/ford-jumps-on-rivians-skateboard/?sh=215fbc2d23ef) platform. This platform consists of “a flat frame that contains the batteries, suspension, motors and braking” on which the cab rests, and theoretically cuts costs in the manufacturing of EVs due to fewer overall parts in assembly. I suspect that this may be the platform used in the inevitable Bronco EV release, due to the striking similarities in the size and styling of the Bronco and the Rivian R1S. It is also possible that Ford may release an entirely new model on the platform, but that is just my hunch.

The equity stake in Rivian was undisclosed, but I expect that that stake may be worth [between $2B and $5B](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/23/rivian-scores-1point3-billion-investment-from-trowe-price-others.html) based on the valuation of Rivian at time of investment (\~$5B-7B) and now (\~$30B-$50B). This equity stake and strategic partnership will serve Ford well in their future development in the EV market.

# Financials and Valuation

**Financial Overview**

2020 was a tough year for many industries and the auto sector was no exception. Ford had 4 consecutive quarters of negative EPS, their YOY revenue fell by almost 20% when compared to 2019, and they had to eliminate their dividend in March 2020 for the first time since 2009 when it was eliminated during the Great Recession, before being reinstated in 2012. So where does this leave Ford now?

Despite the blow to revenue in 2020, Ford is emerging leaner and better equipped to dominate the market in 2021 and beyond. Revenue decreased 20% in 2020, and Ford had to take on significant new debt to continue financing operations. However that appears to be true for most other major automakers during the pandemic, so I don’t expect this to be a major factor in determining which automakers will be most successful in the future. I expect that 2021 will be a blockbuster year for Ford as revenues increase to pre-pandemic levels (I expect higher earnings in Q3 and Q4), and they continue to develop the most profitable arms of their business.

**Dividend Reinstatement**

GM and Ford both eliminated their dividends to survive the pandemic in March 2020, however there is widespread expectation that they will reinstate them sometime this year as revenue begins to pick back up. I personally view this as an incentive to buy Ford before the announcement. If they reinstate their .60 yearly dividend, it would amount to a \~5% annual yield based on the current stock price of 13.37. I expect that the return of their dividend will also attract the return of investors who value dividend stocks which may push the price up further all on its own. I believe this is a mini-catalyst for short term price movement for Ford, and collecting on the dividend won’t hurt either.

**Comparison to Other Traditional Automakers**

Generally, I like to look at 4 different ratios to quickly judge the valuation of a company compared to their peers in the same industry. Lets compare Ford’s numbers to their closest 5 competitors (Toyota, Honda, VW, GM, Daimler) to get a sense of how fairly they are currently valued. I’m avoiding comparing Ford to newcomers like TSLA, NIO, etc. because frankly the numbers aren’t comparable. Financial data was gathered from Finviz and Yahoo Finance.

Quick definitions of the ratios, with respect to current valuation:

P/S = Share price/Sales per Share (Lower is better)

Forward P/E = Share price/(Estimated net profit for next year/# of outstanding shares) (Lower is better)

Debt-to-Equity = Total debt/shareholder equity (Lower is better)

Current Ratio = Current assets/Current liabilities over the next year (Higher is better)

Price to Book = Share price/Book value per share (Lower is better)

|**Ratio**|**Ford**|**Toyota**|**Honda**|**VW**|**GM**|**Daimler**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/S|0.39|0.99|0.45|0.53|0.66|0.50|
|Forward PE|8.64|12.92|9.24|10.67|9.49|8.87|

As you can see, Ford has noticeable strengths and weaknesses when it comes to valuation. Strictly looking at revenue metrics like P/S and P/E, Ford is the most undervalued company on this list. They do however carry the largest debt burden of all of the listed companies, so that is something to keep in mind. I’m not particularly worried about their debt situation, as their Current Ratio at 1.20 indicates that they are in no present danger of being crushed by their debt, and I expect that strong future revenue will allow them to dig themselves out of that hole.

Compared to GM, who I believe to be their closest competitor, they are trading at a much lower revenue multiple (0.39 vs 0.66). Even accounting for Ford’s higher debt burden, I believe they should be trading closer to a 0.50 multiple, which puts them more in line with other traditional automakers.

My personal price target: **$17.14/share**

# 2021 Outlook

**Massive Demand**

Ford’s most recent releases the 2021 F-150, the 2021 Bronco Sport, and the 2021 Mustang Mach-E are all flying off dealer’s lots at [record pace](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/05/demand-looks-very-high-for-fords-tesla-fighting-mu/). The auto industry quantifies demand with a specific metric called Time to Turn. This is a measure of how long a vehicle sits on the lot before it is purchased. The industry average Time to Turn is somewhere [around 60 or 70 days](https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/auto-industry/new-vehicle-inventory-swells-in-february.html) for new vehicles. Anything under 20 days generally indicates that a specific model is in very high demand. I’ll list the Time to Turn for Ford’s three new models in 2021 below:

2021 Ford F-150: 9 days

2021 Bronco Sport: 13 days

2021 Mustang Mach-E: 4 days (!!!)

As you can see Ford’s recent releases have been massive successes so far, and I expect that as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic that demand will only continue to rise for these models.

**7500 tax credit availability**

Remember that $7500 federal tax credit that everyone was all excited about when EVs first went to market in the U.S.? Me neither. The reason you may not have heard about this tax credit in awhile is probably due to the fact that the biggest seller of EVs (Tesla) is [no longer eligible](https://www.cars.com/articles/tesla-tax-credit-is-expiring-heres-everything-shoppers-need-to-know-1420700959540/) to receive the credit for purchases of their vehicles. The second biggest seller (GM) is about to lose eligibility at the end of this month.

The way this program works is that an auto manufacturer is eligible for the credit for their first 200,000 vehicles sold in the U.S. After that, they are only eligible for state-level tax credits which tend to be much smaller if they exist at all. To date, Ford has only sold a measly 10,000 EVs total in the U.S with around 5,000 of their largely unsuccessful Focus EV and 5,000 of their new 2021 Mach-E. That means they have an enormous 190,000 vehicles left for which their purchasers can be incentivized by the tax credit. In my opinion this gives Ford a massive advantage over their closest competitors (GM and Tesla), and in fact, we are already seeing Ford stealing market share directly from Tesla as it appears that [nearly 100% of Tesla’s recent loss in market share is attributable to Ford](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/04/business/ford-mustang-mach-e-tesla-market-share/index.html).

Bear Case

**Chip Shortage**

As I’m sure you’ve heard by now, semiconductor shortages are projected to be a [massive problem](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/01/semiconductor-shortage-halts-auto-factories/) for the auto industry as a whole. Recent estimates put nearly 1 million new vehicles affected by the shortage in Q1 2021 alone across the entire auto sector. Ford has already had to cut shifts at some of their manufacturing plants because they cannot secure enough chips to produce as many vehicles as they’d like. A few automakers like Toyota and Hyundai had the foresight to maintain their semiconductor supply, and thus their 2021 production will not be affected. The chip shortage will surely cut Ford’s top-line revenue, and it is not expected to ease until late 2021 at the earliest.

**Battery Supplier Issues**

In February 2021, the U.S. International Trade Commission [ruled against battery supplier SK Innovation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-sk-innovation-ford/u-s-itc-criticizes-ford-for-pursuing-sk-innovation-battery-deals-idUSKBN2AX00Z) in their patent battle with competitor LG Chem. SK Innovation is the contracted supplier for batteries for the planned F-150 EV. This caused reasonable consternation among investors who were worried that the F-150 production timeline could be affected. Buried in the ruling however, was a stipulation that SK Innovation could continue to supply Ford with batteries for the F-150 through 2025, which should give Ford time to shift to a new supplier. There is always a chance that the Biden administration overrules the ITC in favor of securing greater production capability for the U.S. Nevertheless, this represents a hurdle that Ford will have to address in the future.

**Debt Burden**

There’s no way to sugar coat it, Ford has a ton of debt. They were a relatively debt heavy company prior to the pandemic, and that has only become worse. If you look at the company comparisons done above you can see the relatively high debt-to-equity ratio that ford carries compared to other automakers. The good news is that much of that debt isn’t due in the near future and Ford’s outlook is due to improve significantly from the disaster that was 2020.

**New Competition (Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, Etc.)**

This post has already become obscenely long so I’m not going to go into great detail here. You’ve all heard of these companies and how they intend to disrupt the auto sector, costing traditional automakers market share. There is no doubt that there are more players on the field these days, and Ford and GM will not have a virtual monopoly on the American market anymore. I personally only have high hopes for a few of the newcomers, but they still represent one more obstacle on Ford’s path to success.

**Closing**

I believe that Ford is currently undervalued and is ready to succeed as a leader in EVs in the future. This does not mean that investing in Ford is a sure thing; parts shortages, a high debt burden, and emerging competition all represent serious threats to Ford’s core business. Nonetheless, I am confident in Ford’s future prospects and consider them to be a strong buy as a long-term investment.

2021-02-01 18:52:09,GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next,"Hello all,

If you don't recognize my name then perhaps you haven't seen my posts at the start of all this. You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Things looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.

Now, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.

But what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.

Melvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.

One of two things can happen to these people:

1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able
2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.

This logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.

So what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.

Now, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**

If shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?

Normally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.

If they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.

Another question to consider:

If shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.

The final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.

Now, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.

Now, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:

1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.
2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.

**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.

I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.

**EDIT:** For people claiming the liquidity defense, please tell me why trading on TSLA was not blocked during its insane short squeeze. If that sounds aggressive I'm sorry, I'm truly trying to find an answer to this question. 

**EDIT2:** This all speculation, no one knows what comes next, no one. We just do our best to guess.

**EDIT3:** Revolut has set AMC and GME to sell only today. I can’t wrap my head around these moves, but the squeeze is over? Not likely...something simply doesn’t add up here

**EDIT4:** Today’s volume already blows away yesterday’s and Fridays giving more merit to my thesis. Trading restrictions still have complete blocks on GME but RH opened the flood gates an hour ago. My God this stock is exhilarating.

**EDIT5 - 02/03 08:17** I know everyone wants an update to my option and I would love to give one. Sadly the transformer in my building has blown and the power is out on my entire side of they building. This means no heat and no electricity. My dog and I are freezing and worse than that I work from home. 

A quick update on my personal opinion, I’m still bullish. Yesterday was expected, I didn’t think it would go under $100 but we figured it would be bloody. Today is very interesting with T+2 definitely being over that means we are starting to get some Failure To Delivers. GameStop getting listed on the [short restriction list ](ftp://ftp.nyxdata.com/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers_2021/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers_202102/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers20210202.xls) makes things interesting as well. Apparently Warren is also pushing for an emergency meeting, just speculating but it could result in a 30 day trading halt. Moral of the story, I’m still bullish, Im still holding, this is all speculation, anyone who pretends it isn’t speculation is full of shit. You ultimately have to decide. If you want Mark Cubans insight on the whole situation check out his [Ask Me Anything](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawubt/hey_everyone_its_mark_cuban_jumping_on_to_do_an/). Good luck, make the best decision you can make and don’t regret it. Hindsight is always 2020 in the stock market.

2020-07-17 07:46:26,Hyliion: The REAL TSLA/NKLA killer - at least in the trucking industry,"Hyliion (future ticker HYLN) should be IPOing via reverse merger sometime within Q3. Hyliion makes electric power trains for semi-trucks and their system fits in existing OEMs so trucking companies don't have to buy an entire new truck and retrain the drivers like with TSLA or NKLA.

The current version runs on renewable natural gas (recycling farm and landfill waste, reducing overall methane and carbon emissions to negative levels), and the next generation Hypertruck ERX that should be released in 2021 will be fuel agnostic and also able to run on hydrogen.

This is an important IPO because unlike Tesla and Nikola, the Hyliion power train not only helps the environment but actually saves trucking companies money over traditional diesel over the lifetime of the truck - it pays for itself in less than two years, after which every year it saves up to $20K in gas. Not only that - it goes 2-4x further and fills 3x faster (1300 miles per 10 minute renewable natural gas fill) than the Tesla semi (300-500 miles per 30 minute charge.)

Here is a price comparison of cost of 7 year ownership:

* Traditional Diesel - $431,850
* Hyliion Hybrid Electric (current version) - $404,493 (6% savings vs. diesel)
* Hyliion Hypertruck ERX (next gen coming 2021) - $279,776 (35% savings vs. diesel)
* Tesla Semi - $438,000 (costs 1% more than diesel)
* Nikola - $637,500 (costs 48% more than diesel)

The Hyliion Hypertruck ERX also is the only one that gets better 7-year total payload than diesel - gaining $35,000 worth of payload capacity, while Tesla loses $140k and Nikola loses $52.5K in payload capacity.

Given the drastic cost savings relative to traditional diesel, much less their even more expensive and worse performing electric semi-truck rivals, Hyliion has the opportunity to be a game changer in the trucking industry, saving both money and the environment at the same time. Other than a higher upfront cost than traditional diesel, there is no real disincentive for the trucking industry to convert to Hyliion power trains.

This will make it harder for Tesla and Nikola to compete outside of niche appeal - it is a luxury in an industry on slim margins that cares about the bottom line. Once Tesla gets their semi truck driving fully autonomously will it have a bigger advantage, but until then Hyliion should win the next decade.",31,0.78

2. MSFT & AMZN have a very diverse business portfolio and are less dependent on singular product sales like AAPL & TSLA longer term however with the ways things are in the world MSFT, AMZN and AAPL are very much positioned to capitalize.  The jury is still out on TSLA for me.
3. I think after stock splits of TSLA, AAPL the smart money moves to MSFT and AMZN, and their price movement in the last couple of weeks is impacted by the capital needed for investors to build their positions in AAPL and TSLA.  This is clearly indicated by the volume development in the last month AAPL and TSLA(\~+27% for both in the last month) v MSFT (\~+0.6%) and AMZN (\~+5%) in the last month.

The magic numbers: if AMZN or MSFT were to hit $2trn MKT Cap (not unrealistic), then their share price would need to be: :

\- $4K (AMZN) - increase of 18% from today.

To be more competitive in pricing AMZN will need to look at a possible 1:20 stock split

\- $265 (MSFT) - Increase of 20% from today.

To be competitive in pricing MSFT will possible be looking at 1:3 stock split if they were to proceed, but this might be a year or so out.

Looking at the speed and monumental increase post split announcement of AAPL and TSLA ... imagine what will happen if AMZN did a split... Lock, Load and be ready....

AAPL +16.1%

TSLA price targets from same sites is as high as 800, and as low as $19!!! It currently trades for around $425......

I priced it out and it was $117 so I pulled the trigger.  Keep in my most of my total option buying has been between $80 - $150 total.  I just saw that this fell within my “learning budget” at $117 and bought it......forgetting it was x100.  So I paid $11,700.  I didn’t realize this until last week when I checked on it figuring it wasn’t going to go down enough to happen and I would just let the option expire.  When I realized my error I sold it and recouped $2500 giving me an expensive $9,200 learning experience.  Doing the math I figure after the split I would have had 5 x $395 PUT on TSLA if I didn’t sell it.  And given the trend the last few days it might actually fall below that.  So did I make a mistake?

2021-03-05 18:21:48,PSA: Why Treasury Rates matter for your Fundamental Equity Valuations,"*FYI This is going to cover some very fundamental stuff that I'm sure a lot of you already know, however since there's plenty of casuals and new joiners, I figured it might be worthwhile to give a primer on.*

Here's a simple question: **What is a stock worth right now and why?**

There's lots of ways to answer this question, many (revenue multiples, earnings multiples, etc) are short hand or simplified ways of describing the same thing.

The foundation of modern finance answers this with: **The Present Value of all Future Cash Flows**

Regardless of whether you're talking about equity in a growth tech company, a value oriented utilities operator, or even a distressed oil company, the answer can be broken down further into two components or sets of assumptions:

1. What are those future cash flows this company will produce for this equity share I'm buying?
2. What discount do I give them to calculate their value today?

# Future Cash Flows:

The first component I imagine everyone is conceptually super familiar with. Everyone see's headlines about revenue growth or earnings growth and some kind of % figure that gets them excited. So when it comes to the value of equity, which do we care about?

The answer here is less commonly thrown around. The cash flows we calculate into for an equity valuation are the **Free Cash Flow to Equity**, or **FCFE.**

In short, **FCFE** is how much cash is available to all shareholders **AFTER** all expenses, reinvestment, and debts have been paid. A comparison for personal income would be, this is like calculating how much you have left each month from your paycheck after you take out taxes, pay for groceries, pay that student loan bill, pay rent, and pay for that oil change on your car.

So how do you calculate a company's **FCFE**? Thankfully lots of companies do this already in their non-GAAP calculations, but if they don't it's relatively simple on your own.

`FCFE = CFO - Capital Expenditures + Net Debt`

Thankfully CFO is a standard GAAP accounting figure you'll always have. Capital expenditures are generally straight forward but can be disguised. And net debt is the net change in debt balances, if you issue more debt, more cash is coming in the door, that's considered that higher cash flow to the shareholders.

So this gives you an idea of excess cash that theoretically is coming back into your pocket as an owner of the equity. But you can't do this for infinite years right? At some point you have to just create a final value at some point in the future. This is called our ""Terminal Value"" and it represents some generic assumptions about growth and costs of capital to give you an idea of what all the years beyond that are worth. The formula is pretty straight forward. If I want build a 5 year model, I will include my terminal value in year 5. The formula for figuring this out is as follows:

`Terminal CF = yr 5 FCFE * (1+g) / (WACC - g)`

Now there's a couple ways to think about this, but the easiest way is to simply view it as the value of all cash flows AFTER year 5 at an **assumed growth rate (g)** and assumed **cost of capital (WACC)**. This value is calculated as if you existed in year 5 already and assumed long run growth rate is also the same as the long run rate of growth in the economy. If you subscribe to Damodan's school of valuation (widely viewed as the authority on equity valuation modeling), there is an argument for g being the nominal gdp growth rate.

Now that we've put together the string of cash flows, what is the actual value of what you're receiving?

# Discount Rates:

This is the second component of the answer fewer people on here seem to incorporate when thinking about stocks. The idea here is that there is some inherent discount you need to apply to something you're going to receive in the future. It's a little bit longer but stick with me.

Let's take a step back and think about what that means. If I say I'm going to give you $100 tomorrow, generally you're pretty safe in assuming that's the same as having $100 today right? Cool that's fairly easy. Now what if I tell you I'll give you $50 in 10 years and $50 in 20 years. Are you going to value that the same as scenario 1? No right? Because if you get $100 tomorrow there's still 10+ years of time to do more productive things with that money than you would have in scenario 2 (i.e. invest it etc).

So how does this apply to valuations? Think of all those cash flows we talked about before. The value of ""buying the thing that gives you those cash flows"" is basically all of them summed up right? **Wrong**. Remember those cash flows are in the future... And things in the future are intrinsically worth less than they are today.

So how do we figure out what they worth today? Well that brings us to one of the most fundamental formulas in all of finance:

`FV = PV (1+r)^t`

That is, for a **given rate of growth (r)** and a **given amount of time (t)**, we can figure out what the future value of any amount will be.  If we know our future values, but not our present, then we can just flip this around and solve it the other way:

`PV = FV / (1+r)^t`

We already know FV is just the cash flows we talked about above already. So what is the 1/(1+r)\^t? That's what we call our discount factor and this is where we are finally getting to the topic of this post's title. t is super easy, years are years unless you're some sort of time traveler. The real question here is **""HOW DO WE KNOW WHAT RATE TO USE?""**. The answer in finance to discount your cash flows by the company's **Weighted Average Cost of Capital** or **WACC**. The concept here is that cost of capital comes in two broad components, cost of debt, and cost of equity. Cost of debt is sort of self explanatory. You have some debt, you owe interest on it each year, there's some marginal tax benefit by interest payments lowering your tax obligations, etc. But let's ignore this for a second and pretend we're looking at a company with zero debt.

What the fuck is ""**cost of equity**"" and what does it mean? It's far less tangible of a concept because there are no explicit interest payments that you can point to as ""costs"" like there are for debt. Instead some nobel prize winning financial economists (Jack Treynor \[mentor of Fischer Black\], William Sharpe \[known for the Sharpe Ratio\], and Merton Miller \[known for Modigliani-Miller Theory\]) captured essence of determining an equity share's ""cost"" through a theory called the **Capital Asset Pricing Model** or **CAPM** for short. This was a formula designed to determine what ""cost"" should be assigned to an asset based on a risk free rate of return, a market rate of return, and the inherent correlation of your asset with that market. You can see where I'm going with this. The formula is as follows:

`R(E) = Rrfr + B*(ERP)`

R(E) here represents the expected return of an asset. This can also be called your expected return on an equity or to the company issuing this equity it is the ""cost"" to them that's expected in return for the investor buying their equity.

Rrfr is just shorthand for the expected return on a risk free asset. You wouldn't ever buy into an equity share with the expectation that it gives you less than what the most risk free asset is right? Cool. So in the broad scheme of things there's a couple of things you could use for this, but one of the most common is the 10 year US Treasury yield (or some other duration US Treasury note/bill/bond). The US Government is widely believed to be the most risk free counterparty in the world. It's the nature of being a reserve currency.

B is your assets beta to the market. There's a lot we can unpack with this but for an oversimplification, let's think of it as for every 1% the broad market changes, how much does your equity change by?

And finally, ERP. This is the Equity Risk Premium. There's several ways to approach this but the simplest is to think of it as the general expectation of investors as to how much the broad market should outperform risk free assets. People purchase equity shares with the expectation of higher returns than safer assets? Seems reasonable.

Let's try this out with the broad market. Let's assume beta (B) is 1.0, the risk free rate is 1.0% and the ERP (expected spread between risk free and market) is 8%.

`R(E) = 1.5% + 1.0*(8%) = 9.5%`

That's a fairly reasonable rate. The sanity check here is comparing it to cost of debt. Because equities are lower in the capital structure, their cost should explicitly always be higher than the cost of debt. In the broad market companies are borrowing at less than 9.5% so that rough eyeball test checks out. If you invest in the broad equity market, your expectation is for companies to deliver 9.5% in value to you each year.

This finally brings us back to the topic of this post. You can see, wayyyy down in the granular details of a valuation, the equity markets fundamental valuation are inherently baselined on risk free rates. Now let's combine this with what we talked about above and see why such small changes in that tiny rate can have such large outcomes in valuations.

# Case Study: QuantumScape Corporation (NYSE: $QS)

I'll be honest, the reason I chose this is largely because it's one of the extreme examples that demonstrates how such small changes can make disproportionate impact. Also it seems to be a fan favorite whenever I see it mentioned.

For a case study I want to do a super rudimentary valuation. For disclosure, this is not a robust valuation or financial advice. I'm going to eliminate as many factors as possible and try to keep it just to what we talked about and help illustrate things. I'm not putting this here as DD or an opinion on this stock.

First things first, lets get some cash flows. For this we're not going to do anything fancy. When they were acquired by the \[insert s word thing that shall not be named\] they gave management forecasts and we're just going to take them at face value and extrapolate. Their projected first revenues will come in 2024 but it's nothing really material (14m FY24, 39m FY25, 260m FY26) until we get to FY27 (3.2bn). But remember, we don't care about revenues because as equity holders that's not what we receive. Looking at management's forecast, their Free Cash Flow doesn't turn positive until FY28 when it makes up \~8.5% of revenues. So lets use this and use some really wild assumptions. I'm going to say revenues go up by 75% each year after that and FCF margins stay the same at 10% (pretty insane growth assumptions given such a capital intensive manufacturing company).

&#x200B;

||2028|2029|2030|2031|2032|2033|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenues ($m)|6500|11,375|19,906|34,836|60,963|106,685|
|Free Cash Flow ($m)|565|1,138|1,991|3,484|6,096|10,669|

Now we need to find our terminal value as if it is at the end of 2033 looking forward. Let's assume a relatively high steady state growth of 5% (3% real growth and 2% inflation). So our figure in year 5 is 106\*(1.05)/(.19-.05) = $133.3 billion

At first glance impressions are easy to be ""holy fuck, they're going to have $100 billion in revenue? they're generating cash flows of $150 billion?!? they're only at $15 billion market cap?? sign me the fuck up! buy buy buy!"". But let's take this all the way with step 2 of answering our ""What is this worth today?"" question.

So for this part we need to make a lot of assumptions. And this is important because equity analysts express their views often the most through not assumptions on how a company's cash flows look, but how to think about those cash flow value in present dollars.

Continuing our simplification, let's keep assuming no debt involvement here (mainly bc this post is fucking long) and let's jump back to using CAPM. Let's use the below values:

Rrfr: 1.0%

Beta: 2.0

ERP: 10%

Using these we can see this stock's cost of equity is \~21.0%. It seems high, but this is expected from something with such fantastic growth being priced in to have such a high beta. TSLA for example has a beta of 2.0 and realistically a stock growing at 75% yoy in an economy growing at 3% nominally would likely have a beta much higher than that.

So using our formula's above we can now now solve for our discount factors (the 1/(1+r)\^t numbers to multiply our cash flows by).

&#x200B;

|Year|FY2028|FY2029|FY2030|FY2031|FY2032|FY2033|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|t|8|9|10|11|12|13|
|WACC|21.0%|21.0%|21.0%|21.0%|21.0%|21.0%|
|Discount Factor|= 1 / (1.21)^(8)|= 1 / (1.21)^(9)|= 1 / (1.21)^(10)|= 1 / (1.21)^(11)|= 1 / (1.21)^(12)|= 1 / (1.21)^(13)|
|(DF)|0.22|0.18|0.15|0.12|0.10|0.08|
|PV CF ($m)|141|205|296|428|619|10,686|

The sum of all the PV CF should give us what we think this stock is worth today (since no debt, this would be same as market cap, ignoring any cash balances they currently have). So we get $12.4bn. Compared to a current $15 billion market cap that's another 20% drop WITH some pretty damn rosy assumptions (and low yields). Fuck.

But that's not all.

Now let's dial in new more realistic assumptions. Let's think of pre-covid life and what the norms back then were. 10 year interest rates were between 2-3% in 2018/2019 and inflation was tipping on the hot side of 2% going into end of year 2019, so a 10 year treasury at 2.5% seems a realistic norm and with a higher vol/growth stock like this we can be more realistically at a beta of 2.25. And finally let's keep our ERP and g (macro assumptions) the same.

Our cost of equity is now 25% which makes our discount table look like this:

|Year|FY2028|FY2029|FY2030|FY2031|FY2032|FY2033|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|t|8|9|10|11|12|13|
|WACC|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|
|Discount Factor|= 1 / (1.25)^(8)|= 1 / (1.25)^(9)|= 1 / (1.25)^(10)|= 1 / (1.25)^(11)|= 1 / (1.25)^(12)|= 1 / (1.25)^(13)|
|(DF)|0.17|0.13|0.11|0.09|0.07|0.05|
|PV CF ($m)|109|153|214|299|419|5,718|

With just a slight change in treasury yields and a slightly more realistic shift in beta, we're now talking about a market cap of $6.9bn or a 55% FURTHER DROP from current prices. Start shifting those 75%/yoy growth assumptions towards something that decelerates (a more complicated n-stage DCF that's too much to get into here) and you drop even further. A 10% deceleration yoy would bring this present value more in the $4 billion range.

I'm sorry for being so long winded here, but I felt it was important to explain. In a nutshell that folks, is the power of compounding and why small shifts in a seemingly benign rate can shift massive changes in values for these growth stocks that are primarily basing their value on cash flows happening 10-15 years from now.",501,0.95

So after thinking about it long and hard, going back and forth, I decided to cash out and get off this reusable masterpiece of a rocketship. It had taken me and my SO safely from Earth to Mars and it was time to get off.

The money we made from TSLA helped us make a down payment on our first apartment, so it went to good use. 

Selling TSLA felt bitter sweet as I love this company, I have a man crush on Papa Musk and I was planning initially to hold my dear TSLA shares “forever”. However, I’m forever grateful to this company as it made buying an apartment possible for me. Believing in it paid off.

Thank you Elon. Thank you TSLA. ❤️

Edit: Thank you guys for all the comments! It is crazy how emotionally attached you can get to a stock. I’ve just spent countless hours studying this company and Elon. I believed in it when so many said I was crazy (or thought it). Elon is a true visionary and I truly believe TSLA is going to continue on its path to greatness.

Also, I wasn’t trying to time the top at all. It’s near impossible to do anyway. I just saw an opportunity, went with my gut feeling and seized it.

“With 180k for 4Q the line in the sand, we believe given the underlying strength we are picking up in China as well as a late push in Europe and the U.S., that 190k-200k is well within reach,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a commentary.

He added that “while there are some logistics speed bumps throughout Europe that could derail a number of deliveries in the next few days, the theme of the Tesla story and overall global EV demand continues to be around white hot demand coming out of China.”

Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy also has a neutral rating on Tesla, with a $400 price target. He forecasts 183,000 deliveries this quarter, above what he sees as the sell-side consensus for 163,000 and the likely buy-side consensus for 175,000 to 180,000 deliveries. That would take Tesla to 502,000 deliveries for 2020 as a whole.

Rightly or wrongly this is one man's evaluation of Tesla.  It caused him to sell on the first big jump to $640.   He makes a great case for $427 (which is why he sold on its first rocket to $640) but has rewritten his valuation so that you can add up the parts and see what you come up with yourself.

2021-03-09 13:21:15,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, March 9, 2021. Please enjoy!","After a steep pullback in the last couple of weeks, stocks roared back Tuesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq recording its best day since April 2020. The move marked a stark reversal after the index sank into a correction by the close of Monday's session, plunging a total of more than 10% from a recent record closing high. Goes to show how volatile the market can be. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 1.42% higher and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.10% up.

The sharp contrast between the performance of the Dow and the Nasdaq in recent weeks underscores market participant’s increasing rotation out of high-flying tech stocks that led the markets higher in 2020 into stocks that are poised to directly benefit from the impending economic reopening. 

The Treasury yield pulled back a little but remains at elevated levels, which was pressuring equity markets, particularly tech stocks, in recent weeks. . Rising interest rates hurt high-growth stocks the most because high-growth companies generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. 

Courtney Dominguez, Payne Capital Management Senior Wealth Advisor said, “This is a trend that tends to happen as we get out of a recession: You tend to see stocks move towards cyclical. So things like value companies or small caps, things like energy, tend to do really well when you’re coming out of a recession. And what happened last year is, those tech companies were really doing so well that their prices were getting extremely high. I don’t think these companies are going away. I think a lot of these are going to be things that we continue to have in our workplaces going forward. But the question is, are these companies so expensive, is all the optimism already priced in?”

Over the weekend, the Senate approved the $1.9 trillion stimulus package. The bill, which includes $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify is set for a vote in the House of Representatives tomorrow before being sent to President Biden’s for signature. The bill is likely to pass before the March 14 deadline where enhanced federal unemployment benefits expire.

KEY POINTS
Congress reached a deal Sunday on a $900 billion coronavirus relief package, according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Lawmakers will move to vote on the proposal, along with a full-year government spending bill, as soon as Sunday night.
Millions of Americans have awaited aid for months as Congress failed to agree on another plan to boost a health-care system and economy buckling under the weight of the pandemic.

Congress reached a deal Sunday on a $900 billion coronavirus relief package, a long-delayed effort to boost an American health-care system and economy buckling under the weight of the pandemic.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced the agreement on a pandemic aid and full-year government spending bill. He did not delve into many details. Congressional leaders have not yet released text of the more than $2 trillion legislation, which they hope to pass in the coming hours.

The agreement follows months of sniping on Capitol Hill over how best to fight a once-in-a-century crisis. A new round of aid cannot come soon enough for the millions of Americans who have tried to scrape together enough money to afford food and housing.

The $900 billion coronavirus relief plan under negotiation on Capitol Hill was set to include direct payments of $600 to many adults. Some families were also expected to get $600 per child.

The proposal was set to put at least $300 billion into small business assistance including Paycheck Protection Program loans. It would also add a $300 federal unemployment supplement and temporarily keep in place pandemic-era programs that expanded unemployment insurance eligibility.

If those provisions expire the day after Christmas, 12 million people will lose unemployment benefits.

The measure was also set to put critical funding into the distribution of the two FDA-approved Covid-19 vaccines. Health-care workers and top government officials have started to receive shots, and widespread inoculation in the coming months will help the world to emerge from the pandemic’s shadow.

The rescue package was also set to send relief to hospitals, many of which have struggled to keep up with a flood of Covid-19 patients. It was also expected to put new money into education and transportation.

As lawmakers finally reach a deal, the help comes too late for the nearly 8 million people estimated to have fallen into poverty since June. Many in Congress say the proposal will not go nearly far enough to address the scope of the health and economic crisis.

Progressives and some Republicans have pushed for larger direct payments and retroactive federal unemployment payments. A $600 weekly supplement that buoyed millions of jobless Americans in the early months of the pandemic expired over the summer, and it took Congress months to agree to reinstate it.",2465,0.95

With shares up 730%, Tesla bears have seen more than $38 billion in mark-to-market losses this year, according to data from S3 Partners. By comparison, the next-biggest loss for short sellers was on Apple Inc., at just under $7 billion, S3 data shows.

Many of Tesla’s short sellers have closed out their positions over the course of 2020, with short interest falling to 6% of the float from nearly 20% a year ago, according to S3 data.

The next potential catalyst comes in early January, when Tesla reports fourth-quarter vehicle production and delivery figures. Tesla expects to deliver half a million cars in 2020, a huge milestone for a company that initially struggled to mass-produce its Model 3 and is now building additional factories in Berlin and Austin, Texas.

2021-01-17 05:13:12,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How is ""Hype"" calculated?**

Well, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

Do some DD and look at what they are doing right now and the plans they have in the next five years.

2020-07-14 13:40:01,Share price of TSLA after inclusion in S&P500 (assuming they make it),"Sorry if this comes across as a stupid question - I'm fairly new to the stock market scene! My question is: what will actually happen to the SP of TSLA if and when it gets included in the S&P500? My immediate thoughts are that all the funds tracking S&P500 will then have to pour money into TSLA (amount commensurating to however many % TSLA's market cap constitutes in the combined market cap of all S&P500 companies). If my logic is true, then we can expect a certain rise of TSLA's SP for a period of time after its S&P500 inclusion due to the large number of buy orders flooding in from various funds tracking S&P500, followed by a huge plunge due to profit taking. Something tells me that it's not that straightforward, otherwise it'll be a no brainer for investors to invest in TSLA now, then sell a few days after S&P500 inclusion, i.e. after the big money pours in. Please can someone explain this to me, much appreciated!",6,0.69
2021-02-07 07:26:20,"$BB King – The Blacker the Berry, the Sweeter the Juice","**BB King baby**

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice

**2.4.2021 Prelude**:

If you are new to this DD, just continue on through below. If you have been keeping in touch, I mentioned this stock back in the $6 area and we managed to hit $28+ in such a short period of time. Lots and lots of firepower. To be frank, and many who have messaged me know, I started scaling out past 15 and closed out last Monday in the $20 area. Why? Because I wanted the stock to cool off and to let the market determine who really wanted to invest and own the stock, and who wanted it for the trade cause BRRRRR BB GO UP. Well, I’m back in, and here are my updates and reasons why. In addition, BB is decoupling from the GME trade, and should see much more lift comparatively.

**Intro**

Man Blackberry, who the hell thought I’d be investing in you after the fall of BBM and Brickbreaker. Well, strap in folks as I take you through one of the most bullish stories in stonk history, and it all starts with one statement. Everything you’re thinking about with Blackberry at the moment, is wrong.

It is not a phone company. It is not telling you to use BBM. It is a software, automotive, and cybersecurity company that is about to make a killing.

**Let’s begin**:

BB stock price, 6.71 as of Close on 1-6-2021. 
BB stock price, 9.84 as of Close on 1-18-2021. Only 9 days since I first posted. This is just the beginning.
BB stock price, 12 as of Close on 2-3-2021. Hit a high of 28.77 the week prior…this moved so fast.

**Technical 2.4.2021**

On the 4hr, volume is really cooling down lately and it seems to me that sellers are REALLY drying up. People that didn’t even want to part with their BB shares capitulated. Now we likely wash out yesterday’s nice move upwards before continuing to the upside. MACD cross/flip, Moving Averages basing, just looks overall quite nice.


**Recent Earnings**

Fiscal Quarter End| Date Reported| Earnings Per Share* | Consensus EPS* Forecast | % Surprise
---|---|----|----|----
Nov 2020	| 12/17/2020	| 0	| -0.04	| 100
Aug 2020	| 09/24/2020	| 0.1	| -0.02	| 600
May 2020	| 06/24/2020	| 0	| -0.04	| 100
Feb 2020	| 03/31/2020	| 0.06	|0.01	|500

Surprises along the board.

Revenues Q3, $224 MM.

Revenues projected for Q4, $246 MM. This will be beaten immensely.

Full year Guidance 2021, $950 MM. 

Mkt cap, $4 B. 

Total company non-GAAP revenue of $224 million; total company GAAP revenue of $218 million. Non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.02; GAAP loss per basic and diluted share of $0.23. Net cash generated from operating activities of $29 million.


**NEWS EVENTS**

FB settlement

BB won a suit against Zuckerberg $FB related to messaging, whatsapp, and whatnot. This settlement has now occurred. Check Bloomberg for the deets

Someone I know and trust let me know that there are rumors that the settlement is worth $2B and a 2 year partnership. This is not fact, just rumor, but if it is true that is MASSIVE.

BlackBerry IVY – Intellectual Vehicle Data Platform

The big kahuna that will change BB for the next few years. Per BB website: “BlackBerry and AWS are joining forces to develop BlackBerry IVY, a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology.”

What does it mean to the end consumer (the automakers)

**IVY Fueling Business Outcomes**

BlackBerry IVY will help automakers and automotive suppliers:

* Fuel Innovation by supporting rapid development of new customer experiences
* Drive Revenue by unlocking new revenue streams and business models
* Reduce Costs by moving processing to the edge & reducing raw data transmission
* Improve Operations with enhanced data visibility and access
* Expand Ecosystems by unlocking the broader app developer community
Videos on their YT

Want a TL;DR? Automotive, cloud, cybersecurity, IOT, electric vehicles, every bubble on the planet. And this shit got all of it. Want more info?  [Read this](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/aws) and watch their conferences that they have done or are coming up.

The IVY deal has so much commercial promise. Manufacturers are going to buy IVY because of the data gathering, but more importantly IVY is going to become the universal app store for automotive apps. The IVY platform will be universal across manufacturers and models so a developer can build an app that will work on any car that has IVY. BB will take an app store like commission on revenue. Billions.

After cars, IVY and QNX will move to the broader Internet of Things. Planes, trains, medical devices, EVERYTHING will be connected and needs to be secure. BB has competitive advantages over all the other players, especially Linux because it is not secure, while BB’s QNX has the highest achievable safety certs.

If the automotive biz wasn’t enough they have interesting offerings in corporate data security, anti-virus, and emergency notification systems. They are literally in some of the hottest spaces you could be right now, with no signs of cooling.
As of their conferences, IVY and QNX both seem to be opening up many many more avenues of revenue to tackle within the auto space. Per Steve Rai, what was typically 2-3 avenues of revenue is not 5-6, with IVY being a HUGE 7th.

**Partnerships with big companies**

Blackberry partnered with Zoom (link: https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/10/blackberry-and-zoom-together-secure-your-virtual-enterprise-meetings), Microsoft Teams (link: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-athoc-integrates-with-microsoft-teams-for-critical-event-management-301147559.html) and ServiceNow. BB’s Incident Management Response System AtHoc is integrating into the NOW platform. Cybersecurity adding onto big big platforms that exploded this past year. MORE MONEY. I think this should pull above $10 MM per month, $120MM a year? Sounds enticing to me when we are at $~1B revenue with a 76% gross margin.

Sony announced a BlackBerry partnership, per CEO @JohnChen on Twitter: Thank you for your partnership @Sony. You are an icon and I look forward to experiencing your #ElectricVehicle embedded with @BlackBerry software. But first, where I can get a #Playstation5? #EV#PS5

BB & BAIDU announced their partnership too!

**Patents**

BB Selling Smartphone Patents to Huawei, more $$$$ coming in. Recent Sale news here: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-blackberry-sells-90-patents-to-huawei-covering-key-smartphone/?cmpid=rss&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter

BB JUST won a suit against Facebook for one of the patents they hold: https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/blackberry-and-facebook-are-in-process-of-global-settlement. This is minimum likely worth $500 MM+, but to my knowledge off of some juicy rumors, this is a $2B settlement with FB and a 2 year partnership. MASSIVE.

**Business Implications**

BB makes their money from licensing, cybersecurity (one of the only companies that have not been hacked in this SolarWind shit), BB QNX is already in 175 MM cars worldwide, partnered with XPEV, and is in talks with multiple Tier 1 automakers, 20 different OEMs, and will be in vehicles by 2023. Does that mean anything now? Yes, you dumbass. Per CEO John Chen, my new president, #DidYouKnow @BlackBerry has been selected by 19 of the top 25 #ElectricVehicle manufacturers, and they represent 61% of the Electric Vehicle market?

Bubblicious and sexy. Expect some of the big tier 1s like Nissan, Toyota, BMW, and others to jump on this train. Think TSLA doesn’t have competition? They cant even make a billion dollars unless they sell stock.

Here is the biggest catch: Right now the auto industry is actually selling less cars, and many of the EVs that BB is partnered with are really in the liftoff phase. When XPEV (my favorite EV and I am working on my print for them as we speak), NIO, BIDU, Hyundai, get their EV and Self Driving Cars off the ground and start growing their vehicle output, this number will grow and grow. BB is really at the brink of an explosive couple of years. You are entering at the ground floor.

**CONFERENCES**  

BB has just spoken at the following conferences:
Citi’s 2021 Global TMT West Virtual Conference with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) 

JP Morgan 19th Annual Tech / Auto Forum with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) 

Needham’s 23rd Annual Virtual Growth Conference with Ryan Permeh, Blackberry Chief Security Architect & Co-founder of Cylance and Eric Cornelius, Blackberry Chief Product Architect.

Upcoming conference on Feb 22nd, 2 PM EST with **AMZN** and **BB**. Will update with a link when I get the chance

**Conclusion**:

This stock will generate a lot more cash in the coming years, will gain in the short term by offloading old patents, settling with FB and getting some moolah, growing in their partnership with Bezos gang, roll out to more EVs with Tier 1 and Tier 2 automotive companies, and compete with Tesla on this as well. ~~This trades at $6.70.~~ They already are used by big companies for Access and other Mobile apps, so that someone can securely use their dinky iPhone to work. Think big whales aren’t interested? Look at 2022 2023 option OI. 

From here, 12.5 leads to 15, 28, and probably some wild momentum to 40-50. More shorts have entered, likely more institutions have entered long. It is an exciting time for Blackberry, let’s roll

2021-03-09 23:46:03,Be Careful Trading This Week,"I'm quite sure if I posted this on any WSB-related thread I'd get blasted with death threats and insults about my rationale.

ELI5:  The last two days of GME/AMC movement seems to be driven by something other than a hedge squeeze. Volume is 1/5th of previous squeeze, order flows for GME per Fidelity is NET NEGATIVE (meaning more selling than buying) and for GME, near break even. Maybe, if we're lucky, we continue to see green for another day or two, but I have a bad feeling about a rug incoming, and it's going to be quick and sudden. 

The same goes for the energy sector with TSLA, NIO, XPENG among others. They've been beaten down and I don't see any reasonable shift towards such heavy green across the board. SPCE, Cannabis, etc. were all beaten down and have all resurfaced green. China stocks have also turned green after the blood week. I don't see this as a buy the dip as volume is simply too low. The LVL2 data all day for multiple tickers have been odd in that there were a pattern of similar numbers ( like 32 for GME) that kept showing up on the buy and ask side for hours.

Followup from this post. I was invested since 2019 but this time I just couldn't shake the feeling of it going down fast. Ever since the [China fiasco](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/09/tech/tesla-china-regulators-intl-hnk/index.html) and the way Elon purchased bitcoin just came across as such a desperate publicity stunt. All this started to make me feel really uneasy. From there I sold just in time and managed to avoid the 32% loss from that month. That being said, I know the market altogether dropped and open to the possibility that I may have just gotten lucky. However, I think there has to be something I can learn from this besides ""I trusted my gut"". I'm wondering if those things I classified as red flags may be able to help other investors on this sub in the future. Did anyone else see what I saw? What are your thoughts?",26,0.66
2021-03-06 15:22:27,The Tesla Bear Case,"I’d like to share with everyone my Tesla bear thesis. I share this because I’ve seen lots of misinformation lately, and IMO, the bear case is not as bad as people think. 

I’d like to start by recognizing the good things about Tesla. Tesla is the global leader in battery technology, vehicle software, supercharger network, and full self driving. Traditional automakers are so far behind Tesla that they don’t provide meaningful competition. As of today, I don’t believe Tesla is overvalued at its current price, $597.95. But it’s expensive. I believe in the company, but as someone with a 3-5 year time horizon I’m not buying it’s stock. I believe the downside risk is still big while the upside is limited. Here’s why. 

1. Execution risk. Tesla has a lot on its plate, from rapid expansion of manufacturing/logistics, R&D costs for full self driving and world-best battery tech, new vehicle development, and doing something productive with a solar business which is dragging on the company. Not meeting lofty expectations in any of these will drag on the stock price.

2. Competition. I’m not worried about traditional car companies or upstart EV companies. What I’m worried about is Apple with iCar and Google with full self-driving. Apple is dangerous not because of car expertise, but because of their tech savvy and brand loyalty. Their competition is several years down the road, but very dangerous. And in case you were unaware, Google’s subsidiary Waymo which is considered the leader in autonomous driving tech is reportedly valued at $30 billion. Both Apple and Google can seriously jeopardize Tesla’s dominance in the EV market.

3. Elon Musk. Tesla’s stock price is largely a bet on the vision and drive of Elon Musk. However, Elon Musk has suggested in the past his goal with Tesla was to get the world to switch to EVs. Now it seems he’s succeeding in that, and if he steps down as CEO and focuses on his primary interests, space and hyperloop, I believe we will see a prolonged bear market in Tesla stock. 

I love Tesla as a company and I hope they prove me wrong. And I’d like to mention, even if my bear case plays out, Tesla will still be one of the most valuable companies in the world. But I wouldn’t be surprised if the stock price still hovers around $600 in 5 years (still a $573.9 billion market cap). 

Let’s hear what everyone else thinks, and please correct me if I’m wrong about anything. Cheers",12,0.68
