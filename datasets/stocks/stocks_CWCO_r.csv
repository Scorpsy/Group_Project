I’m 23 and trying to buy stocks that I know offer great value and will return great numbers down the road. I’m in it for the long haul - I’m talking 20-30, maybe even 40 years. CWCO seems to be doing very well. It has more cash than debt, it pays a dividend and its potential for new investments seems promising. Thoughts?",1,1.0
