2021-03-31 17:07:05,$ARVL price action,"I have been watching $ARVL for a long time now. Today's price action is a little confusing to me. Anyone know whats going on?

(1) Price didnt budge for months as CIIC

(2) 3 weeks ago, it hit a low around $18 and never saw that price again....until merger

(3) Today, its as low as 15.88 (while everything else is up including ACTC)

What am I missing here? Isnt it oversold? Is this PIPE selling off?

What does this mean for other SPACS that are deemed to be solid like IPOE or CMLF? Should I shave the top off in preparation for the merger date when its going to drop $3-$5?

is this going to be like NVVE and AEVA?   In both cases, I was able to shave the top off with the pop on the date of change.   Then both plummeted to $10-$11.   Is this going to be the norm now for everything?  What's the point of even holding shares?   You aren't going to be rewarded for holding through merger.",4,0.83
