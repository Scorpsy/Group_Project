But why didn't DISCA (and DISCK for that matter) follow?

I get that the there are minor differences like A would have voting rights and B doesn't, plus theres a 30x difference in volume and a corresponding 3x inverse difference in market cap between A and B. The eps is around the same though. The beta for B is just under 1 at 0.97 whilst A and C are around 1.5

So why is there such dispersion between its class A and class B share price? I don't get it.

Sorry, if this is a dumb question.",7,0.9
