In a note to investors seen by AppleInsider, lead analyst David Vogt says that a ""more stable long-term iPhone demand backdrop with better [average selling prices]"" and Apple's ""likely entry into the auto market"" are driving the UBS revision on AAPL shares. 

The analyst says that, based on analysis, aggregate iPhone demand in 2021 and 2022 should be relatively stable. He doesn't believe there's a ""supercycle"" materializing, but he did raise his 2021 iPhone shipment forecast to 220 million, up from 215 million. Looking ahead to 2022, Vogt also raised his 2022 iPhone shipment estimate to 215 million, up 10 million. He attributes the bump to the ""stickiness of the iPhone ecosystem.""
