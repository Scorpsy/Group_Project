What does this mean for a commoner like me who holds 100 shares based off of DD from here months ago? 

Will I be included in the offering at 33/share since I currently hold the stock?

The price is moving downward on the news, is this due to the shares now being ""diluted"" with the new 7.9 million injected with the offering? 

Is this a positive for the current shareholders, or a chance for people who missed the run up to current pricing to get in cheap? 

Thanks for any input.",3,0.8
