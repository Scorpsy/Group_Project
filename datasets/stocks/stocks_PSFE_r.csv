Note: Most of these companies have negative earnings and smaller margins than Paysafe.

I’m  not suggesting it’s worth this much, but for reference, averaging the  above multiples would put BFT/Paysafe’s share price at $135.98

More realistically, taking the average from the lowest four puts the share price at $50.75.

Paysafe is the number 1 digital wallet in Igaming, Draftkings uses them, and most recently they just partnered with Coinbase. As all SPACs do now, it sold off big today with the ticker change so there has never been a better time to buy than now! 

Note : I’m long PSFE with 3,350 shares @15.47

2021-03-31 07:15:30,"PSA: Blackberry / $BB is up 100% for the year, 30% YTD, Nokia ($NOK) is up 30% for the year. What the heck are people complaining about?","Why are people always complaining how Blackberry is misunderstood? Why do they think their ""misunderstood"" technology isn't valued in? There's a chip shortage and $BB needs chips to make money. As far as I know, they don't actually manufacturer the chips. And other companies will get priority in chips before Blackberry.

Even with the recent dips, it's already up 100% for the year. That's pretty good for a stock that always misses out on revenue. And since they need chips to be successful during a chip shortage, I think this stock stays flat or even dips further for the year. But to finish 50-100% for the year is still a nice year. And I think their software is already valued in.

Even $NOK isn't too bad unless you bought at the year high. 

I just don't understand what people expect. Not every ticker can be *""you know what stock"".*

Disclosure: I'm a moron who has a $12/share cost basis, and just think I only have myself to blame. Shouldn't go chasing.",554,0.82
