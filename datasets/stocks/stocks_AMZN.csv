2021-03-08 12:13:25,What is people's confidence level in AMZN right now?,"Its the first time the stock has been below $3k/share in several months. I have 3 shares with a basis of $3,050. I'm comfortable with that but I'm considering getting 1 more share while it's under 3k to lower the basis a bit more. However, if I do so I'll only have about $1.5k left of DCA cash on hand. $1.5k is just under 3% of my total money in my brokerage account. Any thoughts? 

Could it spike back to $3300 quickly or might it be a slow trek back to $3300 if it ever gets back?",9,0.81

2021-03-05 20:41:28,"$AMZN drops as Andy Jassy takes over as CEO, what does history say about when to invest in the dip? Looking at $AAPL in 2011 for a trend.","Hello internet, here's a little context to my request. If you want to get to the meat and potatoes of the request, skip this paragraph. I am a young lad who's getting a grip on his finances. I've decided to start investing, but my young age has me, well, inexperienced. I was planning on opening an brokerage account when I turned 18, but covid had majorly impacted my financial situation from what I had foreseen it to be. So, half a year later, here I am, motivated to start by the GME short squeeze. Having taken a (shortened) semester in highschool where I learned a little about stocks and investments, I've decided that since I'm young and not financially independent to invest in stocks I have a strong feeling are going to grow continually over the years. One of my first thoughts was Amazon, and so with the $20 I had before getting a job I invested about $10 of it into Amazon. 
That investment has since flopped, because as soon as I made the investment, Bezos decided to step down as CEO. actually, this move had been coming for a long time it seems based on a few reddit posts here, one of them dating back to 5 months ago. This experience has taught me to do more research before investing, a valuable lesson to learn. So, now that I have a part time job and nothing to spend the money on, I'm looking at expanding my portfolio. Particularly within my investments in Amazon. 

Even though the CEO transition has plummeted the stock, I firmly believe Andy Jassy will be a strong CEO and that Amazon will recover and begin to regrow. Now, my question is when. My first thought was to look at the history. When has a large tech company changed CEOs, and how long did it take for the stock to recover? So, I looked at Apple. then I got confused. from the looks of it, when Tim Cook took over as CEO of Apple, the stock didn't drop. Why? I'm hoping someone more experienced who might have been invested in Apple at the time could explain to me why the stock didn't drop. Was Steve Job's illness already bringing down Apple's stock growth, and so hearing of a new CEO actually boosted the stock because the public believed Tim Cook would make a good ceo? why isn't this the case with Andy Jassy, who from what I can gather has been the lead of Amazon's most profitable division practically since the beginning? What is the difference between these situations??? Or perhaps, maybe I'm looking at the Apple stock from too macro of a perspective? in which case, how micro do I have to go to see how long it took for their stock to stop dropping and go back up? Apple is only the first of businesses I want to look at who've had CEO transitions – as I know it's important to take multiple examples into consideration when looking for a historical trend – but it's leaving me stumped. I want to invest more into Amazon, but I want to do it at the right time. right now, $AMZN is at the one of the two lowest points it's been at over the last 6 months, and I expect that low to continue to dip, but I'm not sure how long. Any suggestions? Should I invest pieces at every small dip? If so, what percent of my investable money should I invest at each dip? this decision I would make based on the historical trend of stocks' behaviors following CEO shifts, but again, the one I'm looking at ($AAPL) seems to not... make sense. Maybe I should look to different companies for examples? if so, which ones? I'm young and haven't been around long enough to know what tech companies have done this besides Apple. I'm also unsure of what resources I could look into to help me figure out a trend. Anything an experienced investor could offer me would be tremendously appreciated.


TL;DR $AMZN has been dropping since Andy Jassy has taken over, presumably out of concern that he won't lead the company as successfully as Bezos did. Why didn't this concern apply to Tim Cook when he took over as CEO of Apple?  What other companies can I look at to get an idea of stocks' behaviors following a CEO transition?  I'm curious because I want to buy $AMZN at a low price, and so I want to ""see"" (guess/hypothesize) how long $AMZN will sink based on what history has shown. Of course, covid and stuff makes this a very unique situation too, so perhaps it's not even worth finding a historical trend? I'm new to investing and know that I should be investing safely and wisely, but I don't have the experience to determine what would be safe and wise.",9,0.91
2021-02-03 18:49:38,AMZN - where do we go from here?,"I have been a long AMZN investor for past 7 years and mainly because of bezos and how he operates as a startup company even after all these years. They had a stellar quarter and solid guidance for next quarter. But his departure news are troubling for future growth. Are they going to stagnant? The stock didn't move today makes me wonder that other people are also sceptical.

Going forward, what is the bullish case beside AWS. Its funny that I never asked myself that question previously when Bezos was on the steering wheel. I guess bald man was full just of surprises.

I think I am just looking for some confirmation bias so I don't end up selling. Was hoping to put some on NFLX and TSM by selling half my AMZN position.",24,0.82
2021-02-08 04:48:03,Weekly Stock Market News | GOOG / AMZN / PINS / SQ / PYPL / COST & other Stock Market News [02-08],"**The stock market finished a terrific week at record highs. Companies like Google, Pinterest, Amazon & others smash earnings reports while Jeff Bezos bows out. Let’s talk about this & other stock market news**

Hello everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of last week, as we saw all 3 major indexes finish the week with big gains with the SP500 & Nasdaq Composite finishing at new record highs while the Dow Jones did also rise for 5 straight sessions. For the week the [DOW](https://imgur.com/NQpg47q) gained 3.9%, the [SP500](https://imgur.com/cY3wx9N) rose by 4.65% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://imgur.com/T5qgyg5) outperformed gaining just over 6% in what was the best week since early November.

The Volatility [Index](https://imgur.com/Ki1RNHZ) dropped every day last week as it now seats just above 20, with this being a huge level that hasn’t been broken in a long while.

We saw all 11 [SECTORS](https://imgur.com/pp8DYTh) finish the week in the green, with Energy leading the way followed by Consumer Discretionary, Communications & Financials also gaining more than 6%.

[Here](https://imgur.com/tRRK4fZ) is the HEAT MAP from last week, as we saw a hole lot of green in pretty much every sector, with big tech names gaining huge while the biggest lagging sector was Health Care. The big tech names just continue to [increase](https://imgur.com/96Q4J9w) their % of the SP market cap as technology is likely to continue to be one of the best performers in the next decades.

We also saw some interest economic data last week, as manufacturing continue to recover in January as both the [ISM](https://imgur.com/Q9ZPnxF) index and the [PMI](https://imgur.com/nVz0oDe) Index came in pretty solid and continued to stand in expansion territory.

Also, the [ISM](https://imgur.com/jgJ2IbI) Services Index came in better-than-expected rising above expectations due to an increase in employment & new orders.

In terms of Job numbers, we saw [ADP](https://imgur.com/a39dqcB) coming in way better than expected as over 170K jobs were added after a big drop in December. We also saw initial jobless [claims](https://imgur.com/ftMXubP) dropping even more than expected while the continuing jobless claims fell to under 4.6M last week.

This [WEEK](https://imgur.com/vLr3QHG) is pretty quiet in term of economic data, with core CPI, Consumer indexes and jobless numbers being the biggest ones while the [EARNINGS](https://imgur.com/PMP5olx) season continues with some of the most interesting earnings coming from Twitter, Coca-Cola, GM, Uber & PepsiCo while we also have to see how Disney subscriber numbers are continuing to evolve after hugely upgrading their expectations. One other thing that I am also interested to watch is the PayPal investors day on Thursday in which they are expected to provide a 3-to-5-year financial outlook.

In some other stock market [news](https://imgur.com/EcqHtMU), it seems that most of the RBNHD retail investors that have jumped ship are going to Square’s Cash APP with almost 40% of investors choosing the app. We have to see if this trend continues now, after [RBNHD](https://imgur.com/joQIln0) removed limits on all stocks, but regardless, I think Square is a nice FinTech play despite their huge valuation right now, as they will also benefit from the jump in digital currencies and more companies planning to increase investments in integrated POS providers just like Square.

We also had a lot of interesting earnings last week with Amazon [crushing](https://imgur.com/GILwN3r) expectations, beating by almost $7 and almost $6B on revenues as this was the first time Amazon passed the $100B mark in a quarter as the holiday & e-commerce demand combined to give Amazon a 44% increase y/y in sales. The other big [thing](https://imgur.com/WMmAddL) we got from Amazon was that Bezos will step down as CEO as Andy Jassy the current AWS leader will become the next CEO. This news caused some uncertainty for the company, but I believe this is still a long-term buying opportunity as Amazon will remain one of the best companies to own in the world.

Also, one of the biggest fintech companies out there, [PayPal](https://imgur.com/Klv5tD6) showed great strength in their numbers, beating both the top & bottom line as their total payment volume and new active accounts showed continued strength in the move to more & more online payments solutions.

The other big earnings report we saw last week was from [Alphabet](https://imgur.com/5BOUPT0), which also beat by more than $6 and $4B in revenues as they surprised most of the analysts with great beats in most of the segments as their operating margin came in 5% better than expected. The biggest income generator remained the Search & YouTube business as they are still investing huge in their Cloud platform that is still bleeding money, but is very likely to pay out in the long-run.

Other companies also smashed earnings with [Pinterest](https://imgur.com/0zB9SPh) beating expectations after a 76% revenue growth and a 37% user growth while [Ford](https://imgur.com/zerclC2), which was expected to post a loss, turned out positive earnings of $0.43 despite a 9% decrease y/y in total revenues, as the last 2 quarters of the year provided strong evidence that Ford is progressing into turning around the company.

Meanwhile, though they didn’t have an earnings report, [COSTCO](https://imgur.com/6UmGJ7x) reported a rise in sales of almost 18% in January as the total comparable same store sales which rose by 15.9% crushed the analyst expectations of just 11.7%. I believe Costco is one of the best retailers to own despite it trading always at a premium, as the company is also jumping on the e-commerce trend, with a 107% increase in e-commerce sales in January.

And finally, let’s hope for a good day as the [world](https://imgur.com/itl9KxB) stock markets and the US [Futures](https://imgur.com/mlrfLz5) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way after the Treasury Secretary [pushed](https://imgur.com/jfKvaev) for more fiscal aid to help the economy & the unemployment fully recover as fast as possible.

2021-02-11 11:08:19,Message to other young investors,"For background, I'm 20. The markets have been very exciting lately. Huge gains have been made....but also huge losses. I am in the latter group. I saved money for most of my life, and started investing during 2020 after the pandemic hit. I didn't want to trade, I wanted to just get long term investments and hold them. And that did work out pretty well. I was down red at certain points, but it was never SERIOUS drops, and I was confident that my picks were good in the long run. I wouldn't go into details about the weighting, but my portfolio essentially contained AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, SQ, NKE, ARKK, PLTR, NVDA, WMT, COST, DIS, JNJ, PG, V, and a couple other small picks that were my ""fun"" stocks - I actually had a few dozen APHA shares at $6. I had heavy tech weighting, but I was confident in the long term prospects. 

By this year, just about everything was in the green, and collectively up around 15%. Then came BB. BB looked appealing so I sold most of my stocks that had been moving sideways for a while (AMZN, MSFT, NVDA) and put the money into BB when it was low teens. Within a couple days, it hit the 20s and I sold for thousands in profit. The fact that I made thousands of dollars by doing nothing was crazy to me. The rest of my portfolio was also up several thousand dollars (overall, my profit was around $7000 at this point - a combination of the realized gains from BB and the unrealized gains from everything else). 

Then came GME. Several months ago, I neglected GME because I did not think they were a good long term investment, and so I did not buy them when they were less than $20/share. So when I saw the stock jump to 40, and 60 in the span of hours, I thought that was crazy. So what did I do? Naturally, I got FOMO when the stock was almost $400 and bought into the hype because I actually believed in what people over at another subreddit were saying. Within a week, my portfolio dropped around 80% (roughly $20,000). I thought that would be the best learning experience for me, but I bought into the weed hype this week, and have lost another few thousand dollars. **All in all, I've lost 90% of my money in the past month.** I'm young so I can recover, and this wasn't money I needed urgently. But my money I worked for and saved is completely gone because of my decisions. 

I'm writing this mostly for myself because I needed a reality check for myself and don't have anyone to talk to. I can't sleep at nights, and can't really focus on anything else. I've lost all interest in playing video games, and my grades are starting to take a hit. This is really embarrassing for me, and nobody knows I lost my money on stocks (nor do I want them to). I don't know if anyone needs to here this, but please be careful with your money, and don't invest more than you're willing to lose. Especially for young investors, we have such a long time horizon. There's no need to try and get rich quick. Conservative investing will compound over our lives.

Edit: the amount of support has really helped me get out of the dark place I've been in for the past couple weeks. I think I'll call a gambling hotline later just to talk it out with someone. Thanks guys :)

I'd love to hear from everyone how they see things playing out given the context of the US presidential election being a week away.    
    
I'm guessing we'll see a truly wild week. Given the election is only a couple of trading days after earnings are announced, we'll see 5-8% drops as investors seek to take profits and avoid volatility on election day. This could mean opportunities for those with the stomach for what's to come.

2021-02-14 06:01:42,Does anyone else think a catastrophic market crash is NOT coming anytime soon?,"I feel like there’s a consensus on stock forums that a catastrophic market crash akin to the dot com burst is happening soon. They use historical prices to back it up, and they inform anyone who’ll listen to sit on large quantities of cash, because everything will come crashing down soon

Is there anyone out there that thinks that won’t happen?

I can see a -20% decline over the course of a couple months happening in the next couple years. I can also see certain industries that are inflated to come crashing down. If you see what happened to [ZM](https://i.imgur.com/IumMxau.jpg) from October to December, I can easily see something like that happening to a variety of different growth stocks that are completely mispriced. 

But we also have companies making a LOT of money that can justify a lot of the prices. AAPL made over $100 billion **in a single quarter**, and they’re growing 20% YoY. They have almost $200 billion in cash alone, and they’re innovating and finding new ways to make money. Why is a $2 trillion market cap unreasonable?

Same with AMZN, MSFT, and other big tech companies. Unlike the dot com levels, tech companies are actually making a lot of money. I personally can’t imagine a -40% market drop that later stagnates for years on end when companies like AAPL have most cash in hand than their entire 2010 [market capitalization ](https://money.cnn.com/2010/03/29/technology/apple_valuable_companies.fortune/index.htm). 

I know this post is going to get of snark, but I hope we can have an actual discussion. The people who have been screeching “MaRkEt CrAsH iMmInent” are the ones that have been losing the most these last few years (by having large portions of their money uninvested in the midst of an incredible bull run)

With investors finally realizing the potential these tech companies have nowadays, and with tech companies making more money than what was once ever thought possible, does anyone else think a catastrophic market crash just.... won’t happen?",1650,0.95

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 15th, 2021.

# **Stimulus prospects could boost the stock market and interest rates in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/stimulus-prospects-could-boost-the-stock-market-and-interest-rates-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> The prospects of a big government spending program could continue to boost the stock market and put upward pressure on interest rates in the week ahead.
*****
> Earnings season is beginning to wind down, but some big names have yet to report.
*****
> Walmart’s earnings on Thursday should provide a good window into the consumer, as should the government’s retail sales report for January, also expected Wednesday.
*****
> The Federal Reserve on Wednesday afternoon releases minutes from its last meeting, and investors will dig into those for any insight into the central bank’s view on inflation.
*****
> # Two dominant themes amid stimulus prospects
> Inflation and rising interest rates have been two dominant themes for investors recently and have become increasingly so as the market has upgraded its view of how much fiscal coronavirus stimulus could be signed into law.
*****
> “The market is waiting to see how big the package is going to be. It’s going to be important. They can get it through reconciliation,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
*****
> Krosby said that Democrats could pass the stimulus under budget reconciliation, which means they could approve it with a simple majority instead of relying on negotiations with Republicans.
*****
> Some in the markets had anticipated a package of $1 trillion or less if there was a negotiated deal, but that now looks unlikely. Strategists have changed their view on the proposed $1.9 trillion package.
*****
> “There is less pushback to President Biden’s proposed stimulus from moderate Democrats than we expected, so a price tag of around $1.5 trillion seems likely, which is higher than we initially thought,” noted Cornerstone Macro policy analysts.
*****
> They say they expect a bill to come to the floor during the week of Feb. 22, and that it could become law by the first week of March. Investors will stay focused on its progress through Congress.
*****
> Market pros expect the bigger the spending package, the larger the pop will be in economic growth in the near term. That has helped send Treasury yields, which move opposite price, to higher levels.
*****
> It has also increased concerns about inflation.
*****
> # Inflation and rising yields
In the past week, the 10-year yield — a key benchmark — touched 1.2% for the first time since March. It reached that level briefly early in the week but returned to it in the final hour of trading Friday.
*****
> Yields are rising on optimism for an improving economy, but also as inflation expectations also move higher.
*****
> “If you think about the big drivers, they’re related - vaccines, stimulus and inflation,” said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo Securities. “If there’s more talk out of D.C. about moving the stimulus package forward, that sets the stage for yields to go up.”
*****
> The market is concerned about the economy running hotter, since it could be a trigger to change Fed policy.
*****
> At the same time, the Fed has said it would tolerate inflation above its 2% target.
*****
> Krosby of Prudential Financial said the market will also pay attention to the producer price index Wednesday even though it is not typically a big factor.
*****
> “Because there’s such a debate on inflationary trends, I know the CPI [consumer price index] came in comfortable, but the producer price index is coming in and we’ll see if that has eased,” she said.
*****
> “Obviously supply chains are being reestablished and inventories are building,” said Krosby.
*****
> Consumer inflation was running at an annual pace of 1.4% in January.
*****
> # Housing statistics
Housing data is also dominant on the calendar in the holiday-shortened week.
*****
> The National Association of Home Builders releases its housing market index data on Wednesday, a measurement of sentiment around market conditions for new home sales.
*****
> On Thursday, the government will issue data on pending home sales and building permits. Finally, the National Association of Realtors will release existing home sales data on Friday.
*****
> Upcoming hearing on GameStop and short squeezes
Stocks were higher in the past week, with energy, tech and financials as the best performers. The S&P 500 rose 1.2%, ending the week at 3,934.
*****
> There were some market hot spots, like cannabis shares which became the latest target of the Reddit trading community. The stocks shot higher Wednesday, adding to already lofty gains in recent weeks before giving up some of those gains.
*****
> Investors will also be focused on the Thursday hearing before the House Financial Services Committee on the wild trading recently in GameStop and other heavily-shorted names.
*****
> Robinhood’s CEO is expected to testify, as are executives from Melvin Capital Management and Citadel.
*****
> The frenzied activity in some small and shorted stocks has raised concerns about the market becoming overheated. But Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, said the broader market’s advance is intact.
*****
> “Overall, it’s a bull market. I think the steadiness of the advance is underappreciated,” Wald said. He said the market technicals are healthy. Breadth is broad-based and there’s cyclical leadership.
*****
> “The low-volatility, high-dividend paying sectors are at risk,” said Wald. Utilities and consumer staples stocks, which both fit that category, were lower on the week.
*****
> The market was also awaiting the outcome of the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, and it is not expected to react.

> # Presidents' Day Seasonality

> The US equity market will be closed on Monday in observance of the Presidents' Day holiday. Since 1971 when the Uniform Monday Holiday Act set the third Monday in February, rather than on George Washington's birthday (February 22nd) as the Federal holiday, equity market performance during the week of Presidents' Day has been pretty mixed. From the Friday before President's Day through the Friday after, the S&P 500 has traded higher half the time for an average decline of 5 bps. Taking a closer look, in the chart below we show the median returns by day for each trading day in Presidents' week. Tuesday and Thursday have both averaged declines of 13 bps and 7 bps, respectively. Wednesday averages flat performance but the S&P 500 has only been higher 40% of the time. Despite weakness throughout most of the week, equities have tended to catch a bid by week's end with an average 6 bps gain on Friday with a move higher 58% of the time.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021221-Presidents-Day3f.png))**

> In the charts below, we show the average intraday performance of the S&P 500 during Presidents' Day week since 1983 when our intraday data begins. We also include looks for years when the S&P 500 was up and down YTD headed into the holiday. Again, the general pattern has been a steady drift lower until Friday when the S&P 500 has tended to rebound. We would note that the Friday rebound is not an all-day event. As shown, performance is pretty flat in the first several hours of trading with the biggest ramp higher occurring in the final of hours of tradings. That pattern is also consistent for both up and down years, though, in years that the S&P 500 was down YTD headed into the holiday there was a bit of a rebound midweek which was reversed by the end of the week.

> In a recent post we looked at the improving trend of market performance ahead of Presidents’ Day weekend. However, the two days after still display a fair amount of red. Since 1990, Tuesday after Presidents’ Day has been strongest for the S&P 500 with 18 gains and 13 losses for median gain of 0.12% but with an average loss of –0.23%. DJIA also has more gains than losses on the Tuesday after, but NASDAQ is a net loser down 18 of 31 years with and average loss of –0.49% and a median loss of –0.11%.

> Wednesday is all red for all three major averages. NASDAQ and S&P 500 have more losses, but DJIA has a larger average loss. On the Wednesday after the Presidents’ Day holiday DJIA is down 16 of 31 with an average loss of –0.07% and a median decline of –0.10%. S&P 500 is down 18 of 31, average –0.02%, median –0.10% and NASDAQ is down 17 of 31, average –0.01%, median –0.09%.

> # Why Bulls Will Like The Year Of The Ox

> “Bulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.” Old Wall Street saying.

> The Chinese New Year (often called the Lunar New Year) will kick off Friday, February 12, and with it will begin the Year of the Ox. Although we would never suggest investing based on the zodiac signs—it is important to note that the Year of the Ox has historically been quite strong for equities. Not to mention we are saying goodbye to the year of the Rat. Good riddance to the Rat, as the last two years of the Rat were 2008 and 2020, not the best years for many reasons!

> Since the Chinese New Year typically starts between late-January and mid-February, we looked at the 12-month return of the S&P 500 Index starting at the end of January dating back to 1950. And wouldn’t you know it? The Year of the Ox has been up more than 13% on average (with a median advance of nearly 18%); suggesting bulls are smiling indeed!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> “The year of the Ox is the second of the 12 animal signs of the Chinese zodiac, and the Ox is considered a symbol of diligence, persistence, and honesty. Equity returns indeed are quite persistent during the Ox, as it is the third best return out of the 12 Zodiac signs,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> The LPL Chart of the Day shows how all the 12 Zodiac signs have done historically, with the Goat, Tiger, and Ox as the best, while the Rooster and Snake have been the worst.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> We want to stress that no one should invest purely based on the zodiac signs. This relationship is random and the sample size is small. Still, here’s hoping that the Year of the Ox plays out well for the bulls once again!

> # Short Interest Update

> Yesterday, bi-weekly short interest data was released for the period ending January 30th. In the chart below, we show the Russell 3000 broken up into deciles based on short interest as a percent of the float at the end of 2020 and these decile's stock's median change in short interest from then to yesterday's release. As shown, with the short squeeze episode playing out in the second half of January, the stocks that came into 2020 the most heavily shorted have seen the biggest declines in short interest. That decile of what had been the most heavily shorted names has seen short interest as a percent of float fall for a median of 2.65 percentage points. Deciles two and three have similarly seen sizable declines, though, they are far smaller than those of the most shorted stocks. On the other hand, the decile of the least shorted stocks is the only one that has seen the median short interest reading move higher since the end of 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Deciles-F.png))**

> In the table below, we show the stocks that currently have the highest short interest as a percent of float. After the historic move higher, short squeeze poster child GameStop (GME) is no longer the Russell 3000's most heavily shorted name! Having dropped over 100 percentage points since the start of the year, only 42.61% of shares are now short compared to 43.57% for Gogo (GOGO); currently the most shorted stock in the index. GOGO has actually seen its shorts come off a bit this year as well but that decline has been far more modest of only a little more than one percentage point. Of the other stocks in the index, only Tanger Outlets (SKT) and Dillard's (DDS) also currently have more than 40% of the float sold short.

> On the January 27th closing high, GME was up 1,744.53% year to date. But with the short squeeze unwinding, the stock has fallen over 86%. Others of this cohort have similarly seen big reversals of their earlier surges. For example, National Beverage (FIZZ) had doubled YTD at the time of the GME peak, but since then it has been cut by 33.78%. Not all of these have been losers since the pinnacle of short selling though. Fulgent Genetics, have similarly seen big gains of over 30%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Current-High.png))**

> Given GME came into the year with an absurd number of shares sold short, the squeeze has resulted in it being the biggest decliner in terms of short interest of any Russell 3000 stock. Short interest as a percentage of float has fallen over 100 percentage points YTD. The next biggest drop came from BigCommerce Holdings (BIGC) and Dillard's (DDS) which both saw larger than 50 percentage point drops. Of the rest of the top twenty biggest decliners, a baker's dozen have seen short interest drop by at least 20 points. Additionally, of these stocks that have seen short interest fall the most, only three—nCino (NCNO), Berkeley Lights (BLI), and 3D Systems (DDD)—now have a single-digit short interest as a percent of float.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Decline.png))**

> Given the massive short squeezes, there are far more stocks that now have a lower short interest as a percent of float than at the start of the year. In fact, of the Russell 3000 stocks, 1887 have seen declines in short interest compared to only 1146 that have seen an increase. In the table below, we show the twenty stocks to have seen the biggest increases in SIPF since the start of the year. As shown, there is only one, International Game Technology (IGT), that has seen short interest rise by double digits since the end of 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Increase.png))**

> Retailers notably dominate the list of stocks with the biggest declines in short interest. To quantify this, in the chart below we show the aggregate number of shorted shares as a percent of total float for each industry group as of the most recent short interest data and the end of 2020. As shown, just as it was at the start of the year, retailers remain the most heavily shorted industry group, but it has greatly improved with only 5.86% short compared to 8.15% at the end of 2020. That is the only industry group to have seen short interest drop by a full percentage point or more. The industry group to have experienced the next largest decline was Transportation with aggregate short interest falling from 5.08% to 4.13%. Conversely, there are two industries, Banks and Materials, that have higher short interest as a percent of float than they did at the end of 2020.

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week ahead r/stocks.",344,0.98

Another bullish catalyst for stocks in the near term is the fiscal stimulus package that was just approved by the Senate, Tepper said.

The hedge fund manager also said “bellwether” stocks like Amazon are starting to look attractive after the pullback. Shares of the ecommerce giant has fallen 9.7% over the past month, while Apple has dropped more than 11% during the same period.

It is time to buying all big tech stocks.Apple, msft, amzn, tsm, these stocks are all trading at attractive levels due to the recent pullback. Amazon under $3k is really a gift, investors should buy these stocks for a good long term hold opportunity.",35,0.85
2020-11-27 15:37:25,"How much of digital advertising is a bubble fueled by $GOOG, $FB, $AMZN?","The impetus for this question is a two-part Freakonomics podcast, ""Does Advertising Actually Work?"" In these episodes, the host discusses several flavors of advertising, including newspaper, TV and digital ads, the latter which has the largest implications for some of our highest performing companies over the past year. It's clear that this question is hard to answer - there is so much market inertia and business pressures hindering a thorough exploration of the topic, but nonetheless Stephen Dubner is able to present the case of eBay that showed that paid-search advertising has practically no impact on sales. 
Of course digital advertising is important for less mainstream companies who are trying to establish their brand, and micro-targeting consumers is very effective, but that accounts for a fraction of what is spent on these ads globally. Why are giants like Pepsi, Coca-Cola and Kroger still spending so much on ads for products that we all know, and how many hundreds of billions of dollars can they save if they were to conduct their own investigation only to find that these ads have almost no impact on sales? And how would the fallout from these studies affect the digital ad business, which is dominated by $GOOG, $FB, $AMZN in the U.S.?

Early this morning AMCX filed an SEC proxy regarding stock compensation to it's people 

https://www.marketscreener.com/AMC-NETWORKS-INC-8199525/news/AMC-Proxy-Filings-30594120/

Edit: I bought AMCX calls",722,0.96
2020-09-28 07:55:41,AMZN still under value for these 3 reasons,"I feel that AMZN is still undervalued because, firstly, it's so damn sticky it's likely to hold onto a large part of its newly expanded customer base (see below image & ticker news info from Bank of America). 

> Bank of America is out with some shocking statistics on Amazon (AMZN +1.7%) and the e-commerce's site dominance during the pandemic as part of its e-commerce survey update.

> ""60% of respondents search Amazon first when shopping online (vs. 58% last year), while 26% search Google first (up from 25% last year). eBay now at 3%.""

> ""This period, 23% of respondents indicated they complete 76%-100% of online shopping on Amazon, down from 30% in 2019 and 26% in 4Q18. That said, those reporting 51- 75% of their online shopping is on Amazon increased to 26%, up from 17% last year.""

https://imgur.com/a/cD8hKJ8

Secondly, it's got a lower risk factor over the next few months because it's still a pandemic stock and experts are warning that coronavirus cases can rise significantly this Fall/Winter. 

[Thirdly, retailers are racing to prepare for this Fall/Winter, trying to anticipate demand by stocking 10-15% more than normal of basic supplies.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/grocers-stockpile-build-pandemic-pallets-ahead-of-winter-11601199000) So we should see ongoing strong business thru Amazon, but *could* see a repeat of Amazon being the most reliable provisioner of households this Winter if there are more lockdowns. Retailers will be 10-15% more stocked with inventory than they were in March and hopefully people will be more prepared with supplies at home than they were in March, too. But as of Oct 1 we will have 6 months to go until cold/flu season ends in April 2021 and major food manufacturers are still low on inventory.

> Campbell Soup Co. CPB +0.90% ’s overall inventory is only about halfway recovered, and the team is pushing hard to fully catch up by January, according to CEO Mark Clouse. It is racing to get its Chunky and condensed soups and Swanson broths back in stock and adding production capacity for snacks such as Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers and Cape Cod potato chips.

> “A lot of this is going to boil down to how much capacity we’re able to generate,” Mr. Clouse said.

I feel that AMZN can meet its stock price targets over $3500 even if there's a tech stock bubble that's deflating right now.

Because I think it's undervalued, I'm starting to think about call option positions that I can add to as needed.",5,0.61
2020-11-01 01:07:17,"AMZN makes me tech-heavy, still go in during Q4 ""dip""?","Hey All,

I've been watching the recent trends and see AMZN dipping enough that I might be interested in buying, however I am unable to get fractional shares which means getting a full share.

I had set aside around 10k for term stocks and ETFs, which means one share of AMZN would be over 30% of the whole portfolio.

The EPS forecasts are going up, most predictions look positive, the risk seems fairly low. On the other hand with other stocks and ETFs I would be over 50% in tech in a time when sector p/e ratios are at an all time high.

Should I just grumble about the tech bubble and go find somewhere else to put my money?",3,0.64
2020-10-16 16:04:58,"What's going on here with AMZN into the close, algos trading with each other?","So this happened at 3:59 p.m. I was wondering if a lot of people submitted market orders at 3:59 but there weren't any active buyers so some well-below-market-value standing orders got filled.

2021-02-11 05:39:19,"Many tech stocks aren't splitting, despite their levels. Why?","I've been through split histories for many of the big name companies and ETFs, and I've noticed many haven't in over a decade.  E.g. VTI last split 2-1 in 2008, NVidia 2007, and Microsoft in 2003.  It looks to me as if they're either keeping their prices attractive for headlines or they're unsure of the market stability.",30,0.98
2020-08-23 09:41:26,Thoughts on AMZN Stock Split,"I know this topic has been brought up many times and many times people have mentioned Bezos' disdain for stock splits.

However, I can't help think AMZN will announce a stock split in their next earnings report.  With the recent ""value"" created for shareholders of Apple and Tesla with their stock split announcements, I think it would be a disservice to the shareholders by Bezos and Amazon if there hasn't been an internal discussion on a stock split already.

Last stock split was back in 1999.  Stock is currently above $3K, which is almost 30x higher before the stock split in 1999.

Below is a quote from an article I've read:

*""However, nothing has been done to control the price of Amazon’s stock since the last split in September 1999. When asked in 2017 whether he would split the stock again, Jeff Bezos – Amazon’s chief executive officer (CEO) – said that he would not rule it out, but that it was not imminent. As a result, it remains to be seen whether the e-commerce giant will split its stock.""*

A stock split announcement at the next earnings report would be perfect timing, especially if AMZN has another blowout quarter like 2Q.  Assuming 3Q is another blowout quarter and in combination of anticipation of entering the holiday seasons, I could see momentum carrying AMZN share price to $4K+.

In my opinion, the better the 3Q earnings report, the higher the probability of a stock split.

Would like to get some thoughts from others as I'm thinking about biting the bullet and taking the tax hit from gains from GOOGL and re-allocating the funds into AMZN.

EDIT:  I'm going to ask for thoughts in a slightly different way.  I know historically Bezos has been against stock splits.  Last stock split was in 1999 after all.

However, with the recent ""success"" of the stock split announcements by Apple and Tesla, do you think they will have an impact on Bezos' temperament toward stock splits?

I acknowledge if Apple's and Tesla's stock split announcements didn't have such a positive impact to their respective stock prices, I wouldn't even be discussing the possibility of an AMZN stock split.",5,0.69

2021-01-17 05:13:12,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How is ""Hype"" calculated?**

Well, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

2021-02-07 07:26:20,"$BB King – The Blacker the Berry, the Sweeter the Juice","**BB King baby**

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice

**2.4.2021 Prelude**:

If you are new to this DD, just continue on through below. If you have been keeping in touch, I mentioned this stock back in the $6 area and we managed to hit $28+ in such a short period of time. Lots and lots of firepower. To be frank, and many who have messaged me know, I started scaling out past 15 and closed out last Monday in the $20 area. Why? Because I wanted the stock to cool off and to let the market determine who really wanted to invest and own the stock, and who wanted it for the trade cause BRRRRR BB GO UP. Well, I’m back in, and here are my updates and reasons why. In addition, BB is decoupling from the GME trade, and should see much more lift comparatively.

**Intro**

Man Blackberry, who the hell thought I’d be investing in you after the fall of BBM and Brickbreaker. Well, strap in folks as I take you through one of the most bullish stories in stonk history, and it all starts with one statement. Everything you’re thinking about with Blackberry at the moment, is wrong.

It is not a phone company. It is not telling you to use BBM. It is a software, automotive, and cybersecurity company that is about to make a killing.

**Let’s begin**:

BB stock price, 6.71 as of Close on 1-6-2021. 
BB stock price, 9.84 as of Close on 1-18-2021. Only 9 days since I first posted. This is just the beginning.
BB stock price, 12 as of Close on 2-3-2021. Hit a high of 28.77 the week prior…this moved so fast.

**Technical 2.4.2021**

On the 4hr, volume is really cooling down lately and it seems to me that sellers are REALLY drying up. People that didn’t even want to part with their BB shares capitulated. Now we likely wash out yesterday’s nice move upwards before continuing to the upside. MACD cross/flip, Moving Averages basing, just looks overall quite nice.


**Recent Earnings**

Fiscal Quarter End| Date Reported| Earnings Per Share* | Consensus EPS* Forecast | % Surprise
---|---|----|----|----
Nov 2020	| 12/17/2020	| 0	| -0.04	| 100
Aug 2020	| 09/24/2020	| 0.1	| -0.02	| 600
May 2020	| 06/24/2020	| 0	| -0.04	| 100
Feb 2020	| 03/31/2020	| 0.06	|0.01	|500

Surprises along the board.

Revenues Q3, $224 MM.

Revenues projected for Q4, $246 MM. This will be beaten immensely.

Full year Guidance 2021, $950 MM. 

Mkt cap, $4 B. 

Total company non-GAAP revenue of $224 million; total company GAAP revenue of $218 million. Non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.02; GAAP loss per basic and diluted share of $0.23. Net cash generated from operating activities of $29 million.


**NEWS EVENTS**

FB settlement

BB won a suit against Zuckerberg $FB related to messaging, whatsapp, and whatnot. This settlement has now occurred. Check Bloomberg for the deets

Someone I know and trust let me know that there are rumors that the settlement is worth $2B and a 2 year partnership. This is not fact, just rumor, but if it is true that is MASSIVE.

BlackBerry IVY – Intellectual Vehicle Data Platform

The big kahuna that will change BB for the next few years. Per BB website: “BlackBerry and AWS are joining forces to develop BlackBerry IVY, a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology.”

What does it mean to the end consumer (the automakers)

**IVY Fueling Business Outcomes**

BlackBerry IVY will help automakers and automotive suppliers:

* Fuel Innovation by supporting rapid development of new customer experiences
* Drive Revenue by unlocking new revenue streams and business models
* Reduce Costs by moving processing to the edge & reducing raw data transmission
* Improve Operations with enhanced data visibility and access
* Expand Ecosystems by unlocking the broader app developer community
Videos on their YT

Want a TL;DR? Automotive, cloud, cybersecurity, IOT, electric vehicles, every bubble on the planet. And this shit got all of it. Want more info?  [Read this](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/aws) and watch their conferences that they have done or are coming up.

The IVY deal has so much commercial promise. Manufacturers are going to buy IVY because of the data gathering, but more importantly IVY is going to become the universal app store for automotive apps. The IVY platform will be universal across manufacturers and models so a developer can build an app that will work on any car that has IVY. BB will take an app store like commission on revenue. Billions.

After cars, IVY and QNX will move to the broader Internet of Things. Planes, trains, medical devices, EVERYTHING will be connected and needs to be secure. BB has competitive advantages over all the other players, especially Linux because it is not secure, while BB’s QNX has the highest achievable safety certs.

If the automotive biz wasn’t enough they have interesting offerings in corporate data security, anti-virus, and emergency notification systems. They are literally in some of the hottest spaces you could be right now, with no signs of cooling.
As of their conferences, IVY and QNX both seem to be opening up many many more avenues of revenue to tackle within the auto space. Per Steve Rai, what was typically 2-3 avenues of revenue is not 5-6, with IVY being a HUGE 7th.

**Partnerships with big companies**

Blackberry partnered with Zoom (link: https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/10/blackberry-and-zoom-together-secure-your-virtual-enterprise-meetings), Microsoft Teams (link: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-athoc-integrates-with-microsoft-teams-for-critical-event-management-301147559.html) and ServiceNow. BB’s Incident Management Response System AtHoc is integrating into the NOW platform. Cybersecurity adding onto big big platforms that exploded this past year. MORE MONEY. I think this should pull above $10 MM per month, $120MM a year? Sounds enticing to me when we are at $~1B revenue with a 76% gross margin.

Sony announced a BlackBerry partnership, per CEO @JohnChen on Twitter: Thank you for your partnership @Sony. You are an icon and I look forward to experiencing your #ElectricVehicle embedded with @BlackBerry software. But first, where I can get a #Playstation5? #EV#PS5

BB & BAIDU announced their partnership too!

**Patents**

BB Selling Smartphone Patents to Huawei, more $$$$ coming in. Recent Sale news here: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-blackberry-sells-90-patents-to-huawei-covering-key-smartphone/?cmpid=rss&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter

BB JUST won a suit against Facebook for one of the patents they hold: https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/blackberry-and-facebook-are-in-process-of-global-settlement. This is minimum likely worth $500 MM+, but to my knowledge off of some juicy rumors, this is a $2B settlement with FB and a 2 year partnership. MASSIVE.

**Business Implications**

BB makes their money from licensing, cybersecurity (one of the only companies that have not been hacked in this SolarWind shit), BB QNX is already in 175 MM cars worldwide, partnered with XPEV, and is in talks with multiple Tier 1 automakers, 20 different OEMs, and will be in vehicles by 2023. Does that mean anything now? Yes, you dumbass. Per CEO John Chen, my new president, #DidYouKnow @BlackBerry has been selected by 19 of the top 25 #ElectricVehicle manufacturers, and they represent 61% of the Electric Vehicle market?

Bubblicious and sexy. Expect some of the big tier 1s like Nissan, Toyota, BMW, and others to jump on this train. Think TSLA doesn’t have competition? They cant even make a billion dollars unless they sell stock.

Here is the biggest catch: Right now the auto industry is actually selling less cars, and many of the EVs that BB is partnered with are really in the liftoff phase. When XPEV (my favorite EV and I am working on my print for them as we speak), NIO, BIDU, Hyundai, get their EV and Self Driving Cars off the ground and start growing their vehicle output, this number will grow and grow. BB is really at the brink of an explosive couple of years. You are entering at the ground floor.

**CONFERENCES**  

BB has just spoken at the following conferences:
Citi’s 2021 Global TMT West Virtual Conference with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) 

JP Morgan 19th Annual Tech / Auto Forum with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) 

Needham’s 23rd Annual Virtual Growth Conference with Ryan Permeh, Blackberry Chief Security Architect & Co-founder of Cylance and Eric Cornelius, Blackberry Chief Product Architect.

Upcoming conference on Feb 22nd, 2 PM EST with **AMZN** and **BB**. Will update with a link when I get the chance

**Conclusion**:

This stock will generate a lot more cash in the coming years, will gain in the short term by offloading old patents, settling with FB and getting some moolah, growing in their partnership with Bezos gang, roll out to more EVs with Tier 1 and Tier 2 automotive companies, and compete with Tesla on this as well. ~~This trades at $6.70.~~ They already are used by big companies for Access and other Mobile apps, so that someone can securely use their dinky iPhone to work. Think big whales aren’t interested? Look at 2022 2023 option OI. 

From here, 12.5 leads to 15, 28, and probably some wild momentum to 40-50. More shorts have entered, likely more institutions have entered long. It is an exciting time for Blackberry, let’s roll

2021-03-05 18:08:20,If inflation fear is real then why are we not seeing spikes in gold or even Bitcoin,"Call me in denial stage if you want but I refuse to think the recent sell off is “bubble bursting”. We all know inflation will be higher than usual since Feds has been printing money for a year now and why only until recently does people start to take action on inflation risk? Sure bond market has a bearish outlook on the economy but why would some of the obvious inflation hedge like gold or Bitcoin are also down over the past month then. And JPOW’s remarks on future interest rate and inflation rate are very positive and no one seems to believe him. 

Some of you argue that the market is switching over to bonds because it reaches year high. I mean bond yield is still at historical lows. I think this is just a cyclical rotation and some profit taking and a normal market correction as we’ve seen back in September of last year. Just relax and keep buying the dips. AMD sub-80 or AMZN sub 3000 is an absolute steal now. Tech will go back up in no time.",53,0.86

So for everyone trying to predict if AAPL or TSLA are going to keep rising, or if it's going to dip...no one has a crystal ball to answer that. 

If you truly believe in the company, just buy it now...in a few years, it won't even make a difference. Stop trying to time the market.",0,0.44
2020-08-22 04:17:19,"My 2 cents on MSFT, AMZN, TSLA, AAPL","Disclaimer:  I own all four stocks and together they are > 50% of my portfolio (was 45% last week hahaha)

I am looking to rebalance/add more on MSFT & AMZN ... these two will not be left behind in the wake of AAPL MKT CAP.  TSLA is doing its own thing in my opinion

Few things come to mind:

1. Stock split will have to happen soon in AMZN, I actually feel their plans might have been derailed with AAPL and TSLA stock split plans
2. MSFT & AMZN have a very diverse business portfolio and are less dependent on singular product sales like AAPL & TSLA longer term however with the ways things are in the world MSFT, AMZN and AAPL are very much positioned to capitalize.  The jury is still out on TSLA for me.
3. I think after stock splits of TSLA, AAPL the smart money moves to MSFT and AMZN, and their price movement in the last couple of weeks is impacted by the capital needed for investors to build their positions in AAPL and TSLA.  This is clearly indicated by the volume development in the last month AAPL and TSLA(\~+27% for both in the last month) v MSFT (\~+0.6%) and AMZN (\~+5%) in the last month.

The magic numbers: if AMZN or MSFT were to hit $2trn MKT Cap (not unrealistic), then their share price would need to be: :

\- $4K (AMZN) - increase of 18% from today.

To be more competitive in pricing AMZN will need to look at a possible 1:20 stock split

\- $265 (MSFT) - Increase of 20% from today.

To be competitive in pricing MSFT will possible be looking at 1:3 stock split if they were to proceed, but this might be a year or so out.

Looking at the speed and monumental increase post split announcement of AAPL and TSLA ... imagine what will happen if AMZN did a split... Lock, Load and be ready....

“For the first time in four years, the percentage of annual memberships increased in the holiday shopping quarter. In other words, in the December quarter new and renewing members took advantage of the lower annualized cost of a yearly membership, and with that made a longer commitment to Amazon Prime. These new members will be around well into 2021.”

2021-02-17 14:30:34,"HMC (Honda) is massively overlooked, with huge upside potential","I've always loved Honda cars, and recently took a position in HMC after looking over their financials.

When you look at their financials, and how that relates to their stock price, it's pretty amazing that they aren't trading *way* higher. I should disclose that this is using the year data ending 3/31/20 for HMC (I know, a bit old, but you'll see why it doesn't really matter):

Current Market Price: $29.17

Book Value per Share: $43.19

PE Ratio: 5.04

Market Value divided by Book Value: 0.68

2020 Estimated Shipped Cars: 4.5M

Gross Profit: $29.1B

Let's just stop for a second after those figures. The one metric that is truly astounding is HMC is trading *below* it's book value. Honda is one of the largest automotive and motorcycle manufacturers in the world, aside from other products, and yet it trades below its book value. Call me crazy, but even if all it did was reach its book value, you would see a 48% upside. That's already good enough for me.

Now let's talk PE ratio. The current S&P500 PE ratio is right around 40, give or take a bit on when you calculate it out. That's definitely high compared to historical numbers, and there are a whole host of reasons for that that I won't get into. The average S&P500 PE ratio for the past twenty years is 24.9, and its just above 20.1 for the past ten years. With that in mind, HMC's PE ratio of 5 is laughably low. Even if it gets to the S&P500 ten year average PE ratio, which wouldn't even be high by any standard, you're looking at a 298% increase in share price.

Alright, so we're already looking at easy upside from those two metrics, let's slap on another one for good measure - market value/book value. As I mentioned before, you're looking at a 48% upside if the stock price just gets to it's book value. Here's the thing - many stocks these days, including HMC's competitors trade well above their book value. Toyota, for instance, trades at about a 2.6 market/book ratio. If Honda did that, it's share price would be $112.65 right now. Honestly, that seems far more reasonable than where it's at now.

So, even with just those few metrics, it seems clear that Honda is massively undervalued, but it's fun to compare it to the all-scary monster of a stock, TSLA. Take a look at those same metrics and figures again:

Current Market Price: $29.17 vs TSLA at $798.15

Book Value per Share: $43.19 vs TSLA at $24.04

PE Ratio: 5.04 vs TSLA at 1246.88

Market Value divided by Book Value: 0.68 vs. TSLA at 33.19

2020 Shipped Cars: 4.5M (est) vs. TSLA at 500k

Gross Profit: $29.1B vs. TSLA at $6.6B

That's right, HMC has a higher book value than TSLA, and not by some measly margin. TSLA's astounding PE ratio is just outright scary, and that's the type of information that makes Michael Burry's short of TSLA not so crazy, even if he does have a price target of $100 (nearly a 90% loss). That doesn't stop me from having TSLA shares though, which brings me to my next point.

Investor sentiment seems to mean more than anything right now, and HMC has none. It only takes a quick look at trade volume in the last 6 weeks to see that:

TSLA: 925M vs. HMC: 20.2M

My view on sentiment is that it has a lot of power, and sentiment generally sticks for companies that are going places. In my mind it's partly what drove AMZN and TSLA share prices to such insane levels, and not to mention GME. If you look at the 5-year chart for HMC you don't see much sentiment at all. HMC is a safe haven, and seemingly forever a stock that you could sell Iron Condors on just picking up cash. That could all change if people start to catch on that HMC is primed and ready to do *whatever the f it wants* with the $25B it has in cash.

So, here's where I stand. Getting to $43 (book value) would be a correction. Getting to $108 would make it on par with market and similar to Toyota, which I could also view as a correction. If it catches investor sentiment, well, buckle up.

**TL;DR: HMC is massively undervalued by any metric. Upside of at least 50%-300% is more than reasonable, it would be a correction. Comparing it to TSLA is hilarious. Solid financials priming it ready to make moves and catch investor sentiment.**

Positions: 150 shares HMC, 4 shares TSLA. Not financial advice, just providing my own personal view to get some feedback.",164,0.9

2021-02-26 21:57:23,Why equities are just in the beginning of the bull run [Long post],"Wrote this for wsb, but it also goes here, I guess.

TL;DR: This post will try to present the thesis that equities are just in the beginning of the bull run and argues that you should be investing in the stock market right now.

# Premise:

Equities are selling off due to rising [treasury yield.](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/textview.aspx?data=yield) The reason behind the rise of treasury yields are complex.

But let me try to explain nonetheless.

1. People are expecting that the economy will reopen successfully and will have a higher inflation and all that stuff. Now yields being that low, it was slowly getting unattractive as bonds are not necessarily the best investment if the economy goes into full gear as there is less need for safety and [more appetite  for risk assets](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bonds-markets-idUSKBN29Q2NR). Plus, bonds were already at a price where yields  couldn’t have gone any lower(meaning existing bond prices couldn’t have gone any higher). Thus, this lower demand  lead to a rise in yields.
2. This created a feedback loop due to mortgage-backed bond investors selling off their treasury bonds which helped the treasury yield to go even higher. They do it due to convexity hedging. If you have no idea about what I said, [read this one up.](https://www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/convexity-hedging-haunts-markets-already-reeling-from-bond-rout) This has been one of the primary driver behind the recent movement of treasury yield. Overall, this elevated level in treasury yield is unlikely to sustain because the FED continues to abolish the free market and will continue to buy. Thus, the yield is unlikely to rise too much higher.
3. JPow and Yellen has already given us enough indications that they will accept lower rates for a longer period of time. Specifically, until we reach full employment. Thus, they will allow the economy to get hot and also allow inflation to rise if the mean inflation is 2%. These are based on their publicly stated statements, which means it may mean something.
4. Now, consider the scenario, real interest rate will remain negative, the yield in treasury is unlikely to reach too high because of the artificial market scenario. While, we know that ***long term bonds outperformed stocks tremendously*** over the [last 20 years(article data till April 29)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/business/bonds-beat-stocks-over-20-years.html) With long treasury bonds having an annualised return of 8%+, while S&amp;amp;P 500 having only 5.5%+; that was a terrible risk adjusted return for stocks. The same picture emerges for the last 5 years [since 2015(dataset ourdated).](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-17/long-dated-treasuries-crush-s-p-500-performance-over-five-years)
   1. This whole ordeal is because yield was very high at the beginning of the century. And as yield continued to fall, the bonds rose in price, as is customary. Now, as the yield slightly rises, it quickly becomes more attractive as the yields could fall pretty quickly and increase the bond price. This also attracts more bond investors; as a result, I suspect that yields will not rise too much. Plus, it is a very crowded trade.
   2. As a result of bond having this superb risk-adjusted return, stocks saw huge outflows. According to Cathie Wood, [stocks saw $300B in outflows(excluding repurchases)  since 2018 and bonds saw $1T in inflows.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stocks-arent-in-a-bubble-but-heres-what-is-according-to-fund-manager-ark-invests-cathie-wood-11612958113) So, if there is actually any bubble, it is in the bond market. Think about it for a second. Sure, bonds provided absolutely superior risk-adjusted return compared to stocks, but because of this, everyone and their mother are in bonds. Stocks were like the orphan child in the bigger scheme of various financial markets.
      1. Now, bond yields are rising slightly and the yield curve is normalising, but going any higher is unlikely due to the slow abolishment of free market. In this scenario, we won't be seeing any negative rates, while continuing to experience negative real interest rate; being a bond investor would be painful. If you are a bond investor already, you want the yield to go lower, potentially negative, but that is not happening either. If yields rise, you are losing money. If you are a prospective bond investor, you have to worry if yields will go higher just after you invest with all the inflation shenanigans going on.
5. Liquidity is present in the market. Bonds aren't that attractive, stocks are a good bet in this scenario. Especially with all those stimulus talks and stuff. Inflation is also good for the stock market overall as long as we don't go Weimar republic style. After all, you are duddenly not going to stop buying from AMZN, stop using MSFT products or PLTR products just because inflation is here. Question is, which stocks? I think boomer stocks are your best friend(look for the things BRK buys). And after the whole convexity hedging and yield rising stabilises, buying the dip in the tech stocks wouldn't be a bad idea either(I think).
6. US Dollar has been declining after March. It is, overall, good for the stock market and the global economy in general. For one, it makes it easier for foreigners to buy US stocks and two, it boosts the earnings of our corporations in foreign markets. One could say, EM stocks are a potential good source for risk-adjusted return and I also think the same. Although, short USD have had been a popular, crowded and winning strategy for the last year, one should be careful in doing so as any black swan event could catapult the USD higher. However, in the long run, I suppose EM stocks would also be a good area to look out for. Especially, India seems to be the choice for our lawmakers currently.
7. Rising commodity prices and stuff are mostly due to speculation, and not specifically supply crunch. Some are saying that we will see very high inflation due to supply shortage, which would be bad for the market. But I disagree. We have so many structural deflationary forces within our economy. Stagnating wages, high unemployment, technological innovations, cheap labour based production in foreign countries, demographic challenges etc. Some supply crunch is definitely there, but to say that production won't normalise after demand rises due to reopening and stuff is being wilfully blind.
   1. Some of you may not know that CPI does include rents, healthcare expenditures and stuff based on how much they actually cost us, so, before you comment that the government is manipulating CPI to make inflation numbers low, I would suggest you to read how [and what are the weights of each consumption factors.](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/home.htm) Also, stimulus money hardly increases velocity of money because it doesn't really counter the loss of employment income. Just for clarification, there is lots of asset inflation, for example, bonds are very inflated.
8. Our government is doing a shit ton of deficit financing, from that we can expect they will do everything to stop deflation and inflate away the debts. It is in the best interest of our government to keep borrowing money at low cost and to inflate away the debt. Thus, our government has a huge incentive to keep the yield low, while also allowing inflation to rise. You may think, how can this be a free market if... basically, this is capitalism with USA characteristics. Add to that, direct or indirect beneficiaries of these shit ton of deficit financing is, well, the various companies.

# Conclusion

Using my crystal ball, which cost me $0 to buy, I can say this:

This is what I can say from all the points that I have mentioned. Risk assets like stocks are now more attractive than bonds. USD is accommodative for the stock market. Global economic recovery, especially in EM economies will be good, thus helping our companies. Deficit financing. Inflation will be good for ***most*** stocks. Liquidity is present. Bond yields will also stabilise soon as the feedback loop ultimately stops. No deflation. There is likely going to be real inflow into stocks. Stocks will probably finally outperform long term bonds.

Thus, I think, while we will have lower overall rate of return(just like Munger said) in this decade, yet I think we will continue to have a good bull market for a while. Current panic in the market is nonsensical to me.

^(Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I eat crayons and stuff. This is a casino. Don't listen to a stranger on the internet, please don't. I also have used my crystal ball to predict all those future outcomes.)

Risk of my predictions being completely off the mark.

* Fed decides to increase fed funds rate suddenly for overheating/other events and starts quantitative tightening.
* We do have a huge supply crunch in every sector after reopening and inflation goes to the moon. Yields also goes to the moon.
* Black swan events.
* Think of something yourself man!

Edit: My post couldn’t have been more timely! Warren Buffett has warned quite clearly in his annual letter about the ""bleak future"" for debt investors.

“Fixed-income investors worldwide — whether pension funds, insurance companies or retirees — face a bleak future,” he wrote. “Competitors, for both regulatory and credit-rating reasons, must focus on bonds. And bonds are not the place to be these days.”

2021-01-30 22:33:15,Has your opinion of CNBC changed after their coverage of the GME story?,"For several years like many pajama-bound investors, I have gotten up in the morning and turned on CNBC while setting up for my morning trades. 

I've always operated under the assumption that big investors run the network and are the ones with access to get invited on their shows to promote their plays. It comes with the territory knowing that every guest is on there to push an agenda, but generally, my general feeling was they aren't out to screw you over and wanted to be helpful to their viewers.

When I was learning about investing, I did value a lot of the advice they give on diversification, risk, and rising trends. I've even got some massive returns from a few ideas I got solely from watching (MSTR +132% AMZN +73%, TGT +81%, NVDA +63%).

Which takes us to this week where CNBC has been a constant whipping boy on r/wallstreetbets.

Disney parks are reported busy and on capacity limit in Q4, especially in December. They raised limit from 25% to 35% as well. So this shall adds very positively to Q4 revenue.

Disney + subscribers at 87M on Dec 2, over 74M at end of Q3.

With all the revenue increase and recent layoffs, and in Q2 & Q3 they both posted about 15B revenue & close to breakeven profit --- It looks an easy setup for DIS to beat Q4 eps again, and match 15.8B revenue. **My conservative estimate is about 15.7B revenue, and -0.1 EPS. But my high estimate have them on >16B revenue and 0.15 EPS.**

&#x200B;

**Disney + subscribers:** the key growth driver. **My lowest estimate is 92M, and my average estimate is 94---96M, high-end is 100M.**

From NFLX ER, NFLX increased 4M in Oct -- Nov, and another 4M in Dec. They have better increase rate in Dec due to holiday season and Covid lockdown in some countries.

From Comcast ER, Peacork increased 13M subscriber in Q4.

From DIS investor day, we know DIS + increased 13M in Oct -- Nov alone. And they have Mulan, Mando last 3 episodes, Soul on Disney +, all after 12.2 (Investor day cut-off result for 87M subscribers).

Based on the above information, Disney + at least should have 5M more subscribers in Dec, and potentially 10M or more => bringing the total to 92---100M.

In any case, it will be a big feat for Disney +. If it does break 100M, the media will be crazy about its growth, and potentially dethroning NFLX in 2022. Stock -> 200+.

&#x200B;

**Stock Price:** Comcast increased 3% after ER, NFLX 10% (and at one time almost 20%). Assuming DIS on 2.11 closes around 170 (since it never gets any attention, despite the growth picture being very clear now); and the results match the prediction --- **stock will likely trade in 180---200 post ER, depending on how large they beat; with a potential to over 200 if they have >100M subscriber.**

&#x200B;

Disclosure: I have DIS leaps expiring after 2022. My long-term DIS target price is 200--300 this year, and 300--400 in 2022--2023.

Finally, all ER comes with some risk, so be cautious with any weekly option bets.",60,0.94

2021-03-09 15:20:42,Analysis - $LUMN - Lumen Technologies,"# $LUMN - Lumen Technologies (Formerly CenturyLink)

Second time posting DD ($ON was my first [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lh6ppx/on_on_semiconductor_analysis/))- please do provide constructive feedback on what other areas you would have looked into / found useful and overall formatting. Additionally, if you have arrived at different conclusions / can poke holes in the theory I look forward to reading rebuttals in the comments. There was a lot more research that went into this one as some of the kind commenters identified gaps in my research methodology last time so I have tried to make up for it here.

All currency in USD and Millions unless otherwise specified.

### TL; DR

Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink) is a telecommunications company which provides products and services related Network, Cloud, Security, Voice, and Managed Services to enterprise, SME, and retail customers.
Lumen is aiming to position itself as a key infrastructure partner underpinning public and private cloud, edge computing and fiber connectivity. LUMN is building its services with 4 key areas in mind:

1. Physical assets and infrastructure – These include fiber, hardware and facilities.

2. Software managed networking – This is a network-as-a-service (NaaS) offering that can be leveraged to connect organisations with

3. Hybrid Cloud – These include private cloud and datacentres, colocation services and connections with public cloud service provider partners.

4. Lumen Orchestrator – This is the orchestration solution that allows for the management and control of the various services that are offered.

I am currently bearish about LUMN with no immediate plans to invest (although in the event of the price dropping into the single digits, I would re-evaluate this position). There are a few key reasons for this, but I encourage you to read the full bullish, bearish, and neutral considerations in the rest of the post:

1. LUMN earns a significant portion of its revenues from legacy offerings e.g., traditional telephony. This revenue stream has been decreasing YoY for the last few years and this is likely to continue. 

2. Despite the above, there are significant areas of potential for LUMN – specifically in their Edge Computing and software defined networking offerings (see Organisational Summary below). Edge Computing is only a small % of current revenues and while it is likely to grow, it will take time to significantly grow these streams. I view the Edge Computing growth as a slow burner and small market, but this will grow at a rapid rate in the future.

3. LUMN has a high level of debt, and while they have managed to de-lever and reduce interest rates, the amount of debt is still significant. When accounting for intangibles and goodwill, the level of liabilities is roughly 1.6x the value of assets (although specifically looking at long term debt this is a healthier picture at 70% of non-current assets).

4. Revenues have been consecutively down for the last few years and are unlikely to show a significant turnaround next year. This is somewhat mitigated by improvements in margin which are expected to continue and a healthy level of free cash flow at $2,770 although this has been declining YoY. 


Please do have a read of the Bull, Bear and Neutral points in the detailed post below for a more balanced and in-depth view.

### Key Data

All data believed to be accurate as of 05/03/2021

- Price = $13.45
- P/E = -12x
- EPS = -2.12 (dil)
- Forward P/E = 8.5x


# Detailed Analysis

### Bull Considerations

- $LUMN are well positioned to become significant players in high potential markets – specifically fiber and underlying network infrastructure, NaaS and Edge computing.

- $LUMN has several verticals it can offer to customers including Hybrid Cloud, Connected Security and Collaboration. These can be leveraged to grow revenue streams in parallel (i.e., cross selling products and services to customers).

- Successfully managed to de-lever the company from previous debts. While this is a great deleveraging trend and a significant reduction in interest rates by redeeming outstanding 5.375% and 7.00% notes^(1) and replacing them with 4% bonds, the level of debt is still a concern (see bearish consideration item 1).

- The dividend from $LUMN has been consistent and relatively attractive (although on a yield basis this is less so if the price continues to rise). The board are committed to continuing the dividend payment and at the present time it can be safely assumed that $0.25 will be paid per share per quarter for the remainder of FY21. Dividend yield should not be the primary reason for going into $LUMN as yield is ~ 7% (at a stock price of $13.70). In the event of a dip to single digits, the dividend becomes extremely attractive and is worth considering (at a yield of > 9%).

- Despite the overall reduction in EBITDA (see bearish item 4), EBITDA margin has improved and is likely to continue improving into FY21 due to cost cutting measures being pushed by executive leadership.

- Significant number of insider purchases throughout 2020 with one sale.


### Bear Considerations

- Overall, there are likely to be better candidates for returns on investments than LUMN, while LUMN is in a number of attractive areas, it is still growing revenues and these are unlikely to materialise in any significant manner over the next year or two. See competitive advantage section for additional details.

- $LUMN holds significant long-term debt of $31,837 (down from $34,694 in 2019). This debt is primarily due to $LUMN’s all in play to fiber (at the expense of 5g) when they purchased Level 3 Communications for $34,000. It is worth noting that $LUMN has not had an issue with either paying down debt and paying dividends with its current cash flow.

- $LUMN earns a substantial portion of revenues from legacy services. These include voice ($391 in 4Q20) which approximates to 29% of overall revenue. As can probably be guessed, this has regularly declined over the course of FY20. While not all the voice revenue is likely to be a “legacy” product, I am considering it as such as there are likely to be other legacy revenue streams. (N.B. According to $LUMN legacy revenues primarily include voice, private line (including special access), switched access and other ancillary services.)

- $LUMN is facing lengthening sales cycles for its products and services as their customers (and more likely organisations in general) continue to evaluate new infrastructure needs and delay purchasing unless necessary. This is likely to continue until at least 2022 as cost pressure at organisations globally push down purchases.

- Revenues are down both QoQ and YoY with EBITDA down YoY and there is no expectation that they will increase next year with best estimates at stable revenue / EBITDA and worst-case a reduction. YoY revenues have decreased for both FY20, FY19 and FY18, although the rate of decrease has reduced over time.

- Free cash flow while still high is reducing over time and will continue to do so as LUMN are likely to continue to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and paying off its long-term debt.

- Executive compensation (specifically focussing on CEO compensation) is above average for the industry at $17M (compared to an average of $10M for similar sizes). It is worth noting that when comparing against larger companies or those listed as competitors, this level of compensation was not unusual. Compensation did stabilise as performance dropped, however, no decrease in compensation occurred despite the decrease in earnings. While not initially a problem, if the results do not turn around, and there is no decrease in compensation, there is a concern that executive pay is no longer in line with the company’s results.


### Neutral Considerations

- Long term credit rating (Moody’s) – Ba3: Speculative with substantial - high credit risk.

- Speculative Grade Liquidity Ratings – SGL-2: Good liquidity, will be able to meet their obligations over the next 12 months through mostly internal resources but may rely on external sources of committed financing.

- Southeastern Asset Management has increased its position in $LUMN as of Dec 2020. It is worth noting that they have lost (~25%) on the investment to date^(2). Despite this, they remain bullish on the overall prospects as the CEO has tightened controls on costs and margin improves. Additionally, they believe $LUMN can monetise several segments they are in (specifically fiber), and that as a multiple of free cash flow (< 5 at the time of investing) is an attractive valuation. As a final point, they have signed an NDA with $LUMN, and this indicates a higher and more “activist” level of engagement^(3). I have listed this as neutral despite the bullish sentiment of SAM, as their track record for the last year has not been great compared to the overall market.

- $LUMN will be seeing reduced subsidy revenue (from CAF II – A US initiative to improve connectivity) with subsidies declining to $20 by 2022. However, $LUMN believes their investment into providing this connectivity is likely to add to revenue that will make up for the loss in subsidy.


### Organisation Summary

Essentially Lumen Combine underlying infrastructure with platforms (i.e., cloud PaaS) and Applications (SaaS):

1. Adaptive Networking – High performance network connectivity i.e., on premise private lines, Content Delivery Network, fiber internet connectivity, direct cloud connections (where they provide corporate WAN infrastructure a direct link to Cloud) and managed networking services / consulting.
  - Content delivery network market growth is forecast to grow at 14% till 2025^(4).
  - Fiber Internet connectivity in the US grew at 12% from 2019-202022 and will likely continue to grow at a similar rate for the next few years. Across the EU growth rates are largely similar for both coverage growth and subscriber growth^(5).
  - Software defined networking offerings (Networking as a service) is an expanding industry and likely to see significant growth of 34% annually till 2026^(6).
  - Growth rates and industry sizes for private lines and direct cloud connections are not easily available. I believe direct cloud connections are a growth area and likely to grow at a reasonable 10-15% annually for the next few years (based on over all cloud growth, increase in colocation and deployment of data centres – see Hybrid Cloud below).

2. Collaboration - VOIP, teleconferencing, collaboration solutions (e.g., file sharing and virtual meeting rooms all hosted by Lumen, but the products can be from vendors like Zoom, Webex Skype etc.), contact centres and calling services (e.g., traditional phone style calling both locally and internationally as well as toll free / business numbers. Also advanced emergency services support).
  - VOIP is relatively mature industry with a CAGR of 12% (at best) till 2025^(7). Personally, I think we can discount any mobile VOIP growth as I do not believe LUMN has offerings in this space and in my view, this would lower the effective CAGR with 8-10% looking a more reasonable target.
  - Call centre growth is forecast to grow at 6% till 2027^(8). The US houses over 60% of call centres globally, and this number is only going to decrease as increased internet penetration and decreased telecom rates drive the outsourcing of call centres^(9).
  - Numbers and growth rates to traditional telephony are limited but I imagine that growth is probably negative. For toll free, business numbers and emergency services support, growth is likely positive but limited.
  - Collaboration solutions are growing at a reasonably high rate of 13% till 2027^(10). However, LUMN is limited to managing, implementing, running, and hosting products from other vendors as they do not sell their own.

3. Connected Security – Threat management (managed threat intelligence), managed SOC services, WAF and DDoS mitigation, managed firewalls, and professional services.
  - The WAF market is expected to grow at 18% annually till 2022^(11).
  - The DDoS mitigation market is set to grow at 15% annually till 2026^(12).
  - The managed security services are expected to grow at a CAGR of 8% till 2025^(13). While I think managed firewall growth is likely to be less than other managed security services (e.g., IAM, SOC etc), a growth rate of 4-6% is probable.

4. Edge Computing – Managed services, connections to both public cloud and private data centres, networking, colocation, cloud. Essentially connecting edge locations / end user servers to backbone infrastructure. 
  - Edge computing as an industry is forecast to grow at ~25% annually till 2025^(14). However, it is currently a small market valued at ~ $ 2,000 in 20201. Edge computing as a market can be further subdivided into hardware, platform, and services. Hardware is expected to grow at the fastest rate of the three potentially reaching 40%^(15).

5. Hybrid Cloud – Cloud storage, disaster recovery (data replication and business continuity), hosting services, data centres, private and public cloud alongside consulting for cloud.
  - The private cloud market is expected to grow at 29% annually till 2025. Private cloud growth will primarily be driven by businesses who wish to take advantage of public cloud capability with the addition of potentially more secure and customisable hosting resources. On-premises cloud growth will be significantly lower than provider hosted options (PaaS / IaaS) which are likely to hit 50%^(16).
  - Hosting services are likely to increase in market size by 15% annually^(17).
  - Deployment of data centres are likely to increase slowly over the next few years with a growth rate not likely to exceed 10% (estimated at 6% for 2021^(18)). Similarly, colocation services are likely to see a modest 14% CAGR^(19).
  - Global cloud storage is expected to increase at a rate of 20% till 2025^(20).

### Competitive Advantage

1. Adaptive Networking:
 - Summary: A large revenue earner with solid growth potential. $LUMN is a large player in the infrastructure space and should be able to leverage that to provide organisations with NaaS and global fiber connectivity.
 - From a coverage perspective (compared to Verizon and AT&T as of 2019), $LUMN serves 16% of the population, with Verizon and AT&T serving 17% and 41% respectively. It is worth noting that $LUMN covers more states than either^(21, 22). N.B. this view is for consumers but presumably also can also be applied to corporate coverage.
 - $LUMN is relatively well positioned from a fiber perspective as they have a lot of “unique coverage” (i.e., locations served without significant competition) in the US and have coverage in Europe and Asia. They carry a large portion of internet traffic on their network backbone and have 180,000 locations globally which provide their customers direct access to $LUMN infrastructure. Additionally, they have direct connectivity to several cloud service providers and data centres. Compared to competitors, they appear to have the largest total fiber route^(23).
 - The software defined networking offerings are an exciting growth opportunity and combined with the strong infrastructure position of $LUMN will mean that customers (particularly those that are multinationals and large enterprises) can utilise the network as a service offering to connect their enterprise infrastructure efficiently and effectively across the globe including connections from on-premises to cloud service providers.
 - While competitors do exist, from both a software defined networking perspective (e.g., Fortinet, Cato etc.) and an infrastructure perspective (e.g. Verizon, AT&T etc.) $LUMN has the advantage of being a strong player in both areas with good partnerships with Cisco and VMWare.

2. Collaboration:
 - Summary: Largely a legacy business and revenue generator for $LUMN. This will be a shrinking revenue area for $LUMN as the decline in traditional legacy telephony services is unlikely to be made up for by any growth in VoIP or collaboration solutions. Additionally, this area is a large revenue earner for $LUMN, and significant declines here would result in material impact to value.
 - While implementing and managing VoIP, teleconferencing and collaboration solutions with partnered vendors (e.g., Zoom) are likely to show some little to moderate growth over the coming years, they will likely provide consistent revenue due to the underlying network requirements needed to effectively utilise such solutions.
 - Traditional telephony services including contact / service centres and business telephony service revenues are likely to shrink over the coming few years.

3. Connected Security:
 - Summary: The cybersecurity market is an exciting growth area which holds significant potential for $LUMN. However, it remains a small % of overall revenues and so revenue growth in-line with industry expectation will not materially impact the overall value of $LUMN.
 - If $LUMN can leverage their verticals in the datacentre / cloud space to cross sell their security services this could see some reasonably large growth, but overall due to the small footprint of $LUMN in the cloud space presently, material value growth due to this vertical is likely be several years out.
 - Additionally, $LUMN is not a recognised global player in this industry unlike Akamai or NetScout, and so will be at a disadvantage compared to incumbents with higher profile portfolios.

4. Edge Computing:
 - Summary: This could be a strong growth area for $LUMN. Could be a way to take advantage of the potentially significant growth area of Edge computing. However, it is likely to significantly materialise only 1-2 years out with little revenue growth in this area prior to then as organisations slowly accept this paradigm shift. Additionally, it will be a highly competitive area that will require significant investment to grow and maintain an advantage.
 - As of 23 Feb 2021, $LUMN claims they provide 60% of enterprise locations with <5ms latency to edge nodes. Their goal is 90% by the end of the year and their large fiber network leaves them at an advantage compared to competitors. (See Adaptive Networking).
 - An example from the 4Q20 earnings call was SAP using their Edge infrastructure to bring SaaS applications closer to customers and bypassing unnecessary internet traversal.
 - While $LUMN can leverage its underlying infrastructure and assets to push a solid offering, this is likely to be a highly competitive space with players including typical cloud service providers e.g. Microsoft, Amazon, Google and HPE as well as specialised players e.g. Mutable. Large cloud players will have both the hardware and software required to compete effectively with $LUMN while also being able to leverage their substantial public cloud technologies to gain an advantage.

5. Hybrid Cloud: 
 - Summary: If you are interested in taking advantage of private or public cloud growth then Lumen probably is not the best value even at its current multiple. This is due to low revenues (as a % of total revenues) from Cloud related activities. Additionally, this space is highly competitive and $LUMN does not appear to have the background or experience (it is working on growing its employee expertise) although they can potentially take advantage of their underlying infrastructure from their fiber and physical assets.
 - Personally, I believe Private Cloud is not a significantly growing area with potentially some shorter term increase due to pandemic pushing a more remote working / access focus. However, longer term 3-5 years out, I think hybrid cloud will be the dominant focus as organisations transition from private cloud to increased public cloud usage. Only 3% of enterprises use private cloud exclusively^(24).
 - If you are going to opt for growth within public cloud, there are higher growth options with AMZN, GOOG and MSFT although these are substantially higher in price. Alternatively, Cisco, HPE, or other smaller providers may work. A dedicated cloud provider will likely provide better value than $LUMN due to the low revenue share (see above).

2021-01-31 04:32:17,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. I've displayed the most 'popular' tickers on whichever sub-reddit the post may have originated from. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

2020-07-20 00:58:06,Comparing AMZN to WMT + MSFT's Cloud.,"In this post I want to compare AMZN's two segments, it's retail segment and it's AWS segment, to its two biggest competitors Walmart retail and Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud services to see how AMZN is being valued compared to them. 

First looking at Amazon’s retail segment, its revenue is less than half of Walmart’s ($524B to $245.5B) and its operating income is about 1/4 of Walmart’s ($20.6B to $5.3B). However, If Amazon continues its last year’s growth rate of 19% then it will pass Walmart’s revenue (at 2% growth) in just 5 years. Its operating income is harder to calculate because Amazon prefers future market share to current profits, so Amazon retail operating income will probably still lag Walmart’s for some time longer. Walmart’s current Market cap is $373B. Amazon’s retail segment I’d value at anywhere from $350B to $500B, depending on how Walmart+ is able to compete with Prime and slow down Amazon’s growth. 

Now looking at Amazon’s AWS compared to Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment. Both segments are pretty comparable. MSFT has the revenue edge by 11% and the Operating Income edge by 51%. Again, showing Amazon’s strategy of sacrificing current profits for future growth. Though Intelligent Cloud has a higher income growth rate(32% to 26%) Amazon has a higher revenue growth rate (37% to 31%). I’d give more value to MSFT’s Intelligent Cloud segment than AWS but at this point they both have very similar long term potential. Seeing as IC is about 1/3 of both Microsoft’s revenue and profits but has a high steady growth rate, I’d give it a value of about 40-45% of MSFT’s market cap. That gives MSFT’s IC and AMZN’s AWS a value between $616B to $693B.  

If you take the high end valuation of both Amazon’s retail and AWS segment then that gives a market cap of almost $1.2T. That means AMZN is about 25% over valued at its current cap of $1.5T. Or it means MSFT and/or WMT are very undervalued at current valuations. Or a combination of the two. Or you think AMZN will do something that doesn’t exist yet that warrants a 25% premium. What do you guys think on the value of AMZN relative to WMT and MSFT's Intelligent Cloud? 

Full disclosure about 5% of my portfolio is MSFT. I do not own WMT or AMZN shares.",12,0.92

Tepper calls it ""reasonable"" for Amazon to hit $4,000 by the end of 2021. It closed Tuesday just above $3,165.

The weakness came as the 10-year Treasury yield extended its gains. The benchmark rate climbed more than 8 basis points to 1.49% Wednesday after surging to a high of 1.6% last week in a move that some described as a ""flash"" spike. The continuous rise in bond yields is raising concerns about equity valuations and a pickup in inflation.

2021-02-08 04:55:32,Never selling again.,"I am committed to my new investing strategy.

For the individual stock portion of my portfolio (25%), I will never sell another stock.

The idea is to buy various shares that I believe will perform well over the next 60-70 years and hold them forever.

Since I am only investing a few hundred each month in stocks, I will put my subsequent contributions into stocks that have gone up, and I will let those that have gone down sit.

Sure this means that I won’t get the best prices, but the reality is that even people who study this stuff 24/7 for their career, still don’t beat the market.

This strategy will ensure that I put more and more money into winners and that I will only lose a minimal amount on my losers. 

Eventually I will find a few TSLAs or AMZNs and DCA into them for several decades. Creating massive returns! (I hope)

2021-02-27 11:01:07,A Warning About ARK Funds,"Before you downvote: I dont hold a long or short position in any ARK fund or their holdings

This week has been a bad week for tech and growth stock investors in general. The Ark funds have been hit hard and faced some liquidations. Cathie publicly told everyone her plan if faced with liquidations, she planned to sell the megacap stocks so she wouldn't have to touch her illiquid small caps.

Well thats exactly what the ARK funds did this week. As of today ARKK no longer holds any FB, AMZN, AAPL, TSM and BABA. She sold all of it this week and bought more small caps and TSLA. Now ARK is is a very precarious situation. Their biggest stocks are now TSLA, PYPL, SHOP and SQ. If the sell off continues and ARK will be forced to sell these stocks or sell their illiquid small caps.

A lot of people have taken note of this, including hedge funds which may enter predatory shorts if they think ARK is vulnerable. The next couple of weeks is crucial for ARK, should the market go back up they will look like geniuses, but should it go down...they will be in a world of pain.

If ARK is forced to sell the small caps which are illiquid, it will crash the prices and crater ARK's NAV. This will add to the bad performance and may accelerate redemptions creating a death spiral.

2021-03-10 23:30:22,Short Term Investing Advice,"I’ll try and keep this as short as possible with a little background since it’s a specific circumstance. My Mom is a Financial Advisor of 25+ years and has raised me to invest, buy and hold, diversify, etc. She doesn’t buy individual stocks and only invests in Mutual Funds and ETF’s mostly because my Mom and Dad’s age (65/60) and risk level. I always had her put me in Science and Technology and it’s done very well to say the least. I am generally knowledgeable of the market and understand the risks involved.

I am now 26 and working from home. I work in Sales for a TV sports network and make $80,000/yr. I have a stable income. I am obviously much riskier than my Mom and currently have $54,000 in shares of extremely high risk,  volatile stocks (TTD, AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, ABNB, FSLY, PINS, FB, PYPL, SE, SHOP, SQ, MELI, DDOG, ARKK) and around 25 more tech, e-commerce, and infrastructure stocks. The problem is I had saved $30,000 the past year and bought a lot of tech last Monday. Needless to say it got bumpy and my Mom offered me a deal when my account got to $48,000 (16% in 2 days):

Now for the StoNKs advice:

DEAL: Guaranteed my $61,000 original investment if I do not invest any more money this year and simply hold investments of some kind until the end of the year. IF they are above $61,000 at the end of the year, we will split any profits 50/50. 

I am looking to buy a house the beginning of next year so this is around a 6-9 month window. What stocks would you invest in for the remainder of 2021? Would you be extremely risky and tech heavy since that money is guaranteed anyways?

EDIT 1: All financial advice will be considered and evaluated, definitely no guarantees, but my thought process is, if the money is technically guaranteed then I should be in tech/growth for the risk/reward. My Mom agrees with the tech part in Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, but is weary of the growth stocks that ran in 2020 for valid reasons.",6,0.76
2021-02-26 04:59:10,Friday 26 February 2021: A discount bot I have created.,"Friday 26 February 2021

*Live Updates*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Background:**

* My discount bot to help Reddit. It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.
* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.
* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.
* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.
* There are a lot of SPY500/""boomer"" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.
* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.
* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement
* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only
* This is a one man bot.

**Bot Overview**:

It's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits. Backtesting has not been done, do not YOLO your life savings into whatever stated risking it all.  Rather use this as a side tool.

**Key:**

* Penny stocks are very risky.
* Pharma companies are very risky.
* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.
* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.
* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).
* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.
* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.
* Take the ""Calls"" as very discounted, and ""Potentially A Call"" as somewhat discounted.
* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.
* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.
* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.

2021-02-22 08:53:23,Light DD on potential multi baggers and discussion (under $10B market cap),"I’ve done a lot of DD into these under-$10B stocks in the past few weeks and believe they’re undervalued relative to industry tailwinds, revenue growth, EPS growth and strength of their balance sheets.

•	⁠APPS. $7.3B market cap, growing revenue at over 100% per quarter, recently turned profitable and they have a powerful moat in the space they’re operating in. Concerns raised include quality and morality of management and the ethics of some parts of their business model.

•	⁠CRSR. $3.73B market cap. Criminally undervalued at the moment, IMO. Solid balance sheet, 70% rev growth, cash flow positive (recently paid down a bunch of debt), profitable, founder-LED. This thing should be trading way way higher than where it is right now.

•	⁠AEYE. $407M market cap. Operating in a niche industry with solid growth prospects. 90%+ rev growth, planning to turn cash flow positive this year, working solidly towards profitability, strong balance sheet and great customer growth. Just a solid business all around. Also, high insider ownership and low institutional ownership, which could be really good if management can execute.

•	⁠MWK. $1.36B market cap. Working on an innovative business model focused on e commerce, AI and consumer goods. 40%+ rev growth and on the brink of becoming profitable (high chances of them posting a profit next ER). Market is valuing them as a consumer goods company, but their tech, scalability and potential is being misunderstood IMO. Led by a smart and visionary founder.

•	⁠GRWG. $3B market cap. An indirect, less speculative way to get into the cannabis industry. They’re selling the shovels for the gold rush. Scaling extremely fast and effectively, aggressively buying up their competition and consolidating the market. They also have a burgeoning e commerce component. Rev growth is 100%+, management is confident in their continuous strong growth and recently raised guidance for 2021. They’re profitable, flush with cash and have a beautiful balance sheet. Only concern is the shady management team, but it hasn’t posed a problem so far.

•	⁠GAN. $1.03B market cap. Again, another way to bet in a less-risky fashion on a growing but high-risk industry (online gambling). They’re a SaaS company selling the solution for physical casinos to take their business online to compete with DKNG and other digital players. 86% rev growth, tons of recurring revenue, very strong balance sheet. They’re not cash flow positive or profitable yet, but management is confident in high EPS and rev growth for the next 5 years and the CEO seems really capable. They’re uniquely positioned to profit on industry trends and growth IMO.

•	⁠VITL. $1.17B market cap. Probably the less sexy out of all these picks, but also one of the most attractive when it comes to fundamentals. They’re a B Corp focused on ethically producing pasture raised eggs and butter (they’ll probably expand their catalogue into other dairy products soon). AMZN indirectly owns a small stake in them (5% of the company). Their marketing is exceptional and revenue growth has been phenomenal so far at 57%+, although slowing down. They’re profitable, cash flow positive and have the best balance sheet out of all these stocks. Leadership is also awesome and employee moral apparently is really high. The founder of the company still acts as Chairman and has a prominent role in the direction of the company. Only con is that their TAM isn’t really large, so growth is capped unless they go international. Still a great buy right now IMO.

•	⁠CURI. $1.08B market cap. Operating in the massive and still growing digital and video streaming space. They produce their own content in a niche space which is far cheaper to produce for than other type of video content (which allows them to price the service very cheaply compared to alternatives and still generate a profit). 80%+ revenue growth and management has consistently reiterated and raised guidance signaling growth can be sustained for a few years at least. They have a valuable library of content that’s growing rapidly, a good balance sheet, and although not cash flow positive or profitable yet, the growth easily offsets this in this particular business model in which scaling and producing content is way more important IMO. They’re one of the most heftily valued of these picks, but still solid and undervalued because of what they’re doing. Management is very solid, it’s founder LED and leadership has a lot of experience in the niche content they’re producing and that industry. Could easily see them growing the company ten-fold before being acquired by a big player or becoming a top dog themselves. As a footnote, the massive dip today provides a great buying opportunity.

How Alibaba Makes Money


Alibaba's core e-commerce segment generates the largest share of total revenue


By Matthew JohnstonUpdated Feb 4, 2021


Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA) is a holding company legally domiciled in the Cayman Islands but which conducts its e-commerce businesses through its Chinese subsidiaries and variable interest entities (VIEs). Its primary business is to offer a digital marketplace where consumers and merchants can connect and buy and sell from each other. Alibaba operates its business through four primary segments, led by its giant e-commerce operations.


Chief among its competitors are other established Chinese e-commerce and Internet companies, such as Tencent Holdings Ltd., as well as global and regional e-commerce companies, such as Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). Since Alibaba also operates in the cloud-computing business and digital-media and digital-entertainment businesses, it competes with companies specializing in those markets as well.


Key Takeaways


Alibaba provides digital marketplaces for merchants and consumers.
Alibaba's largest business is its core e-commerce operations, but cloud computing is growing the fastest.
Alibaba aims to be a leader in the development of the infrastructure of commerce.
China's antitrust watchdog launched an investigation into Alibaba in late December 2020.


Alibaba's Financials


Alibaba files financial statements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and does so in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The company follows a reporting schedule where the end of its fiscal year (FY) occurs at the end of March.


Alibaba also reports certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, amortization, and depreciation (EBITDA), and adjusted EBITA, which refers to earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization.


Although Alibaba's reporting currency is the Renminbi, the company provides conversions into U.S. dollars, which are used in this story.


The company's revenue rose 36.9% to $33.9 billion in Q3 FY 2021, which ended December 31, 2020.


It was slightly above the 35.3% annual rate of growth posted for all of FY 2020, which ended March 31, 2020.


Alibaba's net income rose 55.5% to $12.0 billion in Q3 FY 2021 compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company noted that the increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in the net gain from increases in the market prices of its equity investments in publicly-traded companies.


Alibaba’s Business Segments

Alibaba monetizes its services through four main business segments that it formally names as: core commerce, cloud computing, digital media and entertainment, and innovation initiatives and others. The company provides segment break downs of revenue and adjusted EBITA, the latter of which was reported as $9.4 billion for the company for Q3 FY 2021.


Core Commerce


Alibaba's core commerce segment is comprised of its various digital retail and wholesale marketplaces, as well as logistics and local consumer services. The company generates revenue from merchants through the sale of a variety of marketing services, membership fees, customer management services, product sales, commissions on transactions, and software service fees. The company generates revenue from local consumers through platform commissions and on-demand delivery service fees.

Core commerce is Alibaba's largest source of revenue at $30.0 billion, or about 88% of the company's total revenue, as of Q3 FY 2021. Revenue for the segment grew 38.2% compared to the same three-month period a year ago.

In terms of income measures, the core commerce segment represents nearly 100% of the company's adjusted EBITA, which grew 14.7% to $10.2 billion in Q3 FY 2021.12﻿﻿ Losses in two of Alibaba's other business segments partly account for the higher-reported figure in the core commerce segment than in adjusted EBITA for the company as a whole.


Cloud Computing


Alibaba Cloud provides enterprise customers with a complete suite of cloud services, including database, storage, management and application services, big data analytics, a machine-learning platform, and other services.


The company's cloud computing segment generates revenue from enterprise customers based on the duration and specific usage of the services.


Cloud computing is Alibaba's second largest source of revenue at $2.5 billion, or about 7% of total revenue, as of Q3 FY 2021. The segment is also the company's fastest-growing source of revenue. Revenue grew 50.3% compared to the year-ago quarter.

Alibaba reported adjusted EBITA of $3 million for its cloud computing segment in Q3 FY 2021, compared to a loss in adjusted EBITA in the year-ago quarter.﻿﻿ It was the first time the segment achieved positive adjusted EBITA.15﻿﻿ The cloud computing segment makes up just a tiny fraction of overall adjusted EBITA.


Digital Media and Entertainment

Alibaba's digital media and entertainment segment exists as part of the company's strategy to capture revenue from consumption beyond its core commerce businesses.The segment generates revenue primarily from customer management services and membership subscription fees.

Digital media and entertainment is Alibaba's third largest source of revenue at $1.2 billion, or about 4% of total revenue, as of Q3 FY 2021. Revenue for the segment grew 0.6% compared to the same quarter a year ago.Alibaba reported a $213 million loss in adjusted EBITA in Q3 FY 2021.12﻿


Innovation Initiatives and Others


Alibaba's innovation initiatives and others segment aims to innovate and develop new services and products that can meet the needs of its customers. Past innovations include digital-navigation app Amap and network-communication app DingTalk.The segment generates revenue primarily through services fees and product sales to enterprise customers and consumers.

Innovation initiatives and others comprise the smallest share of Alibaba's revenue at $207 million, or less than 1% of total revenue, as of Q3 FY 2021. Revenue for the segment rose 9.5% compared to the same three-month period a year ago.
Alibaba posted a $305 million loss in adjusted EBITA in Q3 FY 2021.

Alibaba announced in late September 2019 its goal of reaching 1 billion annual active consumers in its China consumer business by the end of its 2024 FY, as part of its latest five-year plan.
As of December 31, 2020, the company was still short of its goal by 221 million annual active consumers.

﻿In late December 2020, China's market regulator, the State Administration for Market Regulation, said that it had launched an antitrust investigation into Alibaba. The antitrust watchdog noted that it was acting in response to reports that Alibaba was pressuring merchants that sell wares on its platforms not to sell on the platforms of its competitors.

On February 3, 2021, Chinese regulators came to an agreement on a restructuring plan that would turn Alibaba's financial technology affiliate Ant Group Co. into a financial holding company. That change would make the fintech firm subject to similar capital requirements faced by banks.

﻿﻿ The move comes after an attempted initial public offering (IPO) of Ant was halted by regulators in early November 2020, which was followed in late December 2020 by regulators issuing a statement that they would meet with Ant Group about implementing regulations and other rules.1",26,0.8

Anyway, I need some advice on a few long term tech stocks, I got a little lucky, I’ve never played the stock game until March and basically tripled my investments, these are mostly airlines, cruises etc, an example is I got into SAVE at 9, think it’s around 25 now... since I recently got let go and will be hopefully joining another company with a 401k I wanted to try to invest some of my 401k my way, and possibly with the help of some gurus here.  my holdings of about 15,000 below, the plan is to add an additional 10k...as you can see I have 0 tech.

Delta - 8 shares
Norwegian cruise - 272 shares
Boeing - 10 shares
SAVE - 139 shares
Walmart - 15 shares

I know what you are thinking, this looks very dumb and I should have a lot more diversity, but I didn’t really put much money in to start and added a little more on the way when I had the extra income.  Also I do still believe cruise and airlines will be going up a bunch more in maybe 6 months from now etc...So any help diversifying in mostly tech would be fantastic if you had 10k to spend.

It's a significant percentage of my portfolio (\~25%) and I'm wondering if it's worthwhile to sell one of the shares to move into a growth position like NIO, ICLN, etc. that will likely see more short-term growth.

2019-10-25 05:23:15,AMZN earnings report and the 5th anniversary of me being dumb,"AMZN's missed earnings report from yesterday has me ""reminiscing"" about another missed earnings report, how I squandered a massive opportunity, and how I still haven't learned my lesson.

The year was 2014, and AMZN had been trading in the low-mid 300 range all year after hitting an all-time high of \~400 in January, so it was a bit of a down year.  I don't remember exactly what was going on inside the company at the time, but then, on 23 October 2014, it missed on earnings and the price ""plummeted"" the next day, trading in the 280s/290s.  

On that day, it just so happened that I was kind of stranded in the middle of Camp Pendleton with shyte signal, no computers anywhere nearby, and busy AF running a 75-person detachment on 24 hour operations.  It was only a coincidence that I saw the AMZN news because it had been reported in mainstream media and I got an alert on my phone.  I had been watching the company for a few months and thought to myself, what a great day to buy!  They will certainly recover, this company is solid.   

So I whip out my phone, but I didn't have my brokerage app installed... I've only had a smartphone for two years at this point and still wasn't comfortable putting my financial-related apps on there.  But I said to myself, screw it, you can't miss this opportunity.  So I try downloading the app... but, again, shyte signal... download failed.  Try again... download failed.  I tried this for about an hour until while things were quiet, then everything got busy again and I had to abandon my quest to download the app.  

Next thing I know, market is closed, ahhh damn I missed my chance I say to myself.  I get home from camp Pendleton two weeks later and see that the price has now ""recovered"" to 300+ and I figure, oh well not going to buy it now.  

Yeah, so I know everyone has their ""one that got away"" but hot-damn it's not always so easy to pinpoint the moment in time when it happened.  And I would have held it... I'm a long-term investor.  So yeah, that's my unsolicited sob story.

In any case, I haven't learned my lesson because even though AMZN stock price will plummet again today due to missed earnings, I'm not going to buy it... I'll never be able to decouple my emotions from that stock, I'll just let my ETFs and MFs with AMZN holdings deal with it for now.

&#x200B;

**TLDR**; Exactly five years ago, AMZN missed on earnings and I missed a chance to buy it in the 280s because of no phone signal, then gave up hope when it increased to 300-something... like a moron.",191,0.92
2021-03-14 15:26:54,Amazon CC or PMCC? What am I missing?,"I'm new to options investing and I need advice.

I've been selling covered calls on AMZN, usually with a .20 Delta, and making around 1500/week in premium.

I love the big premium and I'm looking to get more.

If the CC option is ever exercised, I think it makes sense to buy some LEAPS options on AMZN and sell PMCCs.

Here's my reasoning:

100 shares of AMZN costs (roughly) $300,000 and a weekly CC sells for (roughly) $1500

Three (JAN 2023) LEAPS with an 80 Delta costs (roughly) $300,000. And writing three covered calls against the three LEAPS would bring in $4500.

Seems like the 3 LEAPS will earn more in premium each week compared to the covered calls. I am bullish on AMZN shares going up in value by 2023. In addition to the juicy premium, the LEAPS options would be more valuable as the stock price goes up, right?

This sounds too good to be true, so what am I missing?

TL,DR: Looks like I can make higher weekly premiums selling PMCCs on my LEAPS instead of Traditional CCs. How am I wrong?",13,1.0

2021-03-03 14:06:27,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, March 3, 2021.","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, March 3, 2021**

Stocks fell for the second straight day, with technology stocks dropping sharply as the Treasury yield ticked higher once again. The S&P 500 fell 1.3%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 2.7%, the second consecutive decline for the tech-heavy index. The Dow Jones Industrial Average held up better, edging down 0.4%.

President Biden said his administration expects to have enough COVID-19 vaccines for any adult that wants it by the end of May, pulling the targets two months closer than the previous government estimate. As a reminder, over the weekend, Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ) single dose vaccine received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), making it the third coronavirus vaccine available in the US, following Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA). Drugmaker Merck (MRK) announced it was going to help Johnson & Johnson produce its coronavirus vaccine. 

In other news, lawmakers in the Senate are set to begin debating President Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus, which was passed by the House of Representatives recently. Democrats are racing to push the legislation forward before the mid-March expiry of augmented Federal unemployment benefits. Republicans do not support the bill because of its size, but through a process called reconciliation. Reconciliation is a way for Congress to enact legislation on taxes, spending, and the debt limit with a simple majority (51 votes, or 50 if the vice president breaks a tie) in the Senate, avoiding the threat of a filibuster, which requires a 60 vote supermajority to overcome. Because Democrats have 50 seats in the Senate—plus a Democratic vice president—reconciliation is a way to get a tax-and-spending bill to the president’s desk even if all 50 Republicans oppose it

The likelihood of more stimulus and widespread business reopenings as the vaccine is distributewd has raised the specter of both speedy growth in the U.S. economy and rising inflationary pressures. Last week's jump in Treasury yields – with the benchmark 10-year yield reaching a one-year high of 1.61% – remains fresh in the minds of investors, who have been eyeing the rise in interest rates as a possible hindrance to the recovery and deviation from last year's ultra-low borrowing costs backdrop. The 10-year Treasury yield currently sits at 1.48% at the time of writing.

2021-02-19 23:25:52,Should I sell my long term stocks and use that money on a different account for more risky trades?,"Hello this may not seem like the most wise option for trading but hear me out... I am 18 and have about $2000 in stocks on my Merrill Lynch account invested in long term stocks (4 IVV and 4 AAPL), another 3000 in TD Ameritrade to do risky and mid-long term trades, and 600 in a Roth IRA, also about 500 in savings. Since I am young and don’t have much to lose, should I sell my 4 shares of IVV and 4 AAPL so I have more to invest in shorter term options and use a higher amount of money on more riskier trades on my Td Ameritrade account? What would I lose if I sold all my shares of IVV and AAPL? Should I just stick to longer term strategies? I feel like I could utilize the money on IVV and AAPL to make more gains on my tdameritrade app. I have made $200 in 2 months off of reading about popular stocks on my tdameritrade account but maybe I’m just getting lucky... (and I’m doing doing SUPER risky trades like DOGE and GME but like MSFT, TSLA, AMD, AMZN...

2020-12-28 05:06:52,Quick Stock Market News for Today | SP500 / NASDAQ / DOW JONES / ALIBABA [BABA] | [12-28],"**Do you want to know what happened in the stock market on Thursday? Let’s talk quickly about that and what were the latest news over the weekend**

**\~Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! I’ll try to keep this as short as possible this time so that everyone can enjoy the holiday period as much as possible. So, let’s start with the recap of Thursday, as we saw all 3 big indexes closing in the green with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/25nr29H) leading the way up .35%, but still lost ground for the week, down .14%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/zRsdNyJ) gaining .26% and finishing .38% up for the week and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/dr0WyrS) rising by .23% to close the short week of trading with a small gain of .1%.

We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/pbKmzP9) dropping by more than 7% again to bring the volatility index down to the previous levels before the 30% [spike](https://ibb.co/hMjhQhH) we saw on Monday, as it has [dropped](https://ibb.co/kgPCkvn) almost 7 points after that spike.

We had a pretty much even market with just over 100 new highs as most [companies](https://ibb.co/SJCrVzX) traded below average volume on the short day, with 10 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/YbSSMt3) of the SP closing in the green, with Real Estate, Utilities & Technology leading the way while the Energy sector was the only one which lost ground Thursday, as Large-Cap growth companies were the [biggest](https://ibb.co/hYTsTLG) gainers, with small-caps finally underperforming after a great run in the past weeks.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/8MKCB9h) from Thursday, with most big tech Names gaining slightly, except Alibaba which plunged after China started the probe into the monopolistic practices of the company, while for the [week](https://ibb.co/f2NzK9d) we can see a pretty mixed stock market with big gains being made in the tech sector mostly, while big healthcare names, utilities and most of the Energy companies lost ground this week.

We also got a couple of economic numbers in the past few days, as holiday retail [sales](https://ibb.co/bB4XtGm) are estimated to be up 3% with online sales up almost 50% between the 11th of October and the 24th of December as e-commerce accounted for almost 20% of overall retail sales, up more than 6% since last year with big winners like Amazon, Wayfair an Etsy as well as big gains in the home improvement and home furniture sectors.

The other big number we received is more worrying, as investors have made a new high in margin debt, with over $700B in [margin](https://ibb.co/qYxdPtw) through November, I personally don’t use margin even when buying leveraged products to avoid too much volatility in my portfolio.

And one last report that we got from Reuters, is that they expect [China](https://ibb.co/LtKVg0T) to overtake the US and become the biggest economy by the end of the decade.

We only have a fed survey coming in [today](https://ibb.co/170H4tD), and this [week](https://ibb.co/Gsjqvf8) will be most of the same, with only some sprinkled numbers in the middle of the week, and not anything interesting to be reported as earnings go, before a closed day on New Year’s Day.

And in some other stock market news, we saw Alibaba increasing the stock [buyback](https://ibb.co/SXgfNW8) plan to $10B but this wasn’t enough to stop the bleeding for the company as this news came alongside the demands made by the regulators for [Ant](https://ibb.co/55zL5VK) Group to fix problems in some segments of their business before they can move on with the company going public.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as the [FUTURES US](https://ibb.co/1XWqjyW) / [FUTURES INTL](https://ibb.co/D5TJ4Cs) seem to be pointing at a good open, with all 3 big indexes in the green as the Nasdaq is leading the way, after President Trump finally signed the [stimulus](https://ibb.co/55v9p8L) deal last night, finally ending this long messy situation.

2021-02-14 21:48:02,My first attempt at a stocks to watch list/DD,"Hi! I've been getting into investing a lot recently, and I'm doing this mainly for my own experience. I'll take any feedback or comments y'all have. Let me know what you think of my first list!

To start off, I want to disclose how I picked this list. I used Morgan Stanley's stock screener to find tickers with their ""overweight"" rating and a price below their given price target (if applicable). Next, I would cross-reference that with RH and Zack's stock analysis. Finally, I would search for each ticker on Reddit in order to see what the sentiment towards the stock was. After compiling the list, I went through each stock individually again and assigned it a ranking of 1-5 (1 being safe, 5 being more speculative/risky), as well as providing a hypothetical dollar amount that I would invest in at the current price.

The goal of this list was to pick a balanced portfolio between aggressive growth and long term consistency. I have a huge bias towards semiconductors, biomedical, tech, and industrial/material.

I'll start with the stocks I gave a 1 rating

1. MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, FB, AAPL ($8k in each)

I believe these will be here for a loooong time as well as continue to grow. These seem pretty safe to me and make up the foundation of this portfolio

Now we get to stocks with a 2 rating. These are my favorites, as I see them having high growth potential and staying power (still riskier than 1s, however)

2. NVDA, AMD, TXG, AMAT, MT, VALE, RTX, TDG, QRVO, NIO, TSLA ($5k in each)

 Now we get on to the 3s! These will follow a similar pattern of higher risk, less amount invested.

3. TER, LRCX, ON, MCHP, FSLY, CRSR, RDSB, DOCU ($3k in each)

Now we get to the 4s. These are mostly speculative

4. SPCE, ANTM, NET, ACAD, ABCL ($2k in each)

That list was pretty short. The 5s will be the most risky/most speculative. They will have the lowest amount invested in them.

5. TGH, SEDG, HUM, AMKR.

Right now, I have roughly £1000 saved up, currently in a mix of AAPL, AMZN, ASRT, and SUMO. At the moment I've been setting small price targets and taking a profit, but this is risky and perhaps not advisable for a beginner. So I'm thinking about moving it all into a mix of ETFs 

Ideally I'd want around £3000 to travel for a few months, so let's say I want a 200% profit.

Would it be better to invest the lump sum into something like the S&P500 / NASDAQ100, or perhaps spread it over separate ETFs, and if so what would be a good mix in your opinion?

2020-11-28 12:16:50,Amazon Could Grab 42% Of U.S. Holiday E-Commerce Spending,"Amazon.com (AMZN) could claim 42 cents of every $1 spent on e-commerce in the U.S. this holiday season, a Wall Street analyst estimates. Its sales are likely to get a boost from a resurgence in Covid-19 infections, which is causing many people to avoid brick-and-mortar stores. Amazon stock rose on Black Friday.

Truist Securities analyst Youssef Squali estimates that Amazon will grab 42% in U.S. e-commerce spending this holiday season. That share, measured in gross merchandise value, is up from 36% last year.

""We're incrementally positive on AMZN going into what should be a blockbuster holiday season, given the company's outsized growth within U.S. e-commerce,"" Squali said in a note to clients Wednesday.

He reiterated his buy rating on Amazon stock with a price target of 3,650. On the stock market today, Amazon stock rose 0.3% to 3,195.34.

Amazon Seen Outpacing Total E-Commerce Growth

Squali believes Amazon will grow its e-commerce sales in North America by 42% year over year in the fourth quarter.

Meanwhile, Adobe (ADBE) projects that total U.S. online holiday-season spending in November and December will reach $189 billion this year, up 33%. That would be a material acceleration from the same period last year, when sales grew 13.1%.

The Covid-19 pandemic is behind much of the growth, Squali said.

The health crisis ""has forced consumers online and away from brick-and-mortar stores, where high density of traffic fuels the transfer of the virus,"" he said. ""In fact, if the current spike in Covid-19 cases continues, and store capacity is further restricted, we believe it would force even more people to order online.""

Amazon Stock 'Best Way To Play' E-Commerce Trends

Amazon also is benefiting from near-record retail store closings this year, Squali said. Year to date, there have been 8,325 announced store closures in the U.S. In 2019, the industry saw a record 9,300 store closures, he said.

Amazon stock is the ""best way to play"" online holiday shopping trends, he said.

Meanwhile, Amazon warehouse workers and activist groups staged protests and strikes against the e-commerce giant in countries worldwide on Black Friday. They were protesting the company's handling of everything from sick pay and Covid-19 precautions to user privacy and environmental concerns. The protests were coordinated under the Make Amazon Pay campaign.

2020-04-18 11:21:58,Amazon Thank You Coronavirus: AMZN is at All-Time Highs," 

## Amazon's shares led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks.

 It was at $2,190 before the virus, it dropped to $1,636 during the virus, and now it is at $2,400. 

According to the weekly chart, the  price easily broke out the trend line. It also respected the long term  uptrend line and bounced back sharply from it.  
  📷  Fundamentally,  according to SimplyWall.St analysis [Earnings are forecast to grow 25.45% per year](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nasdaq-amzn/amazoncom?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=cta&utm_source=yahoo&blueprint=1180933#future)  
  and  [Earnings have grown 60.1% per year over the past 5 years](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nasdaq-amzn/amazoncom?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=cta&utm_source=yahoo&blueprint=1180933#past)  
 

## Is Coronavirus blamed for this surge?

Virus restrictions push people all  around the world to go more online so Amazon specifically gained from  that. Moreover, the company recently announced hiring 75,000 employees,  which sound very  confident, especially in contrast to the dull economic outlooks voiced  around.  
 

Don't forget that IT sector of the S&P is generally doing well and probably is among the best sectors in these times.

In fact, the losses endured by Tesla shorts were more than the short losses for the next nine companies -- combined. Losses on No. 2 Apple (AAPL) in 2020 came to $6.7 billion, which is only slightly more than Tesla shorts lost in the month of December alone. Amazon (AMZN) cost the shorts $5.8 billion, according to S3.

Many of the shorts were forced to admit defeat last year. About two-thirds of the short positions were unwound during 2020, which in itself was a factor that helped drive Tesla shares higher, as the short investors were forced to buy higher-priced shares to exit their positions.

But the year ended with short investors still holding roughly 5.5% of Tesla's shares, which equates to a $31 billion bet against the company's future prospects. For comparison, there is $13.3 billion and $10.2 billion currently bet against Apple and Amazon respectively, with shorts controlling less than 1% of each of those companies' stocks.",314,0.94
2021-02-06 17:38:31,Why I'm confident LMND is going to be a 10-100x investment in the long term,"""The level of ambition of the CEO determines the potential of a company. Their ability to execute and properly build the company culture determines the size.""

At one point analysts believed AMZN was overvalued at a 30 bn market cap, TSLA at 80 bn, and SQ at 20 bn. Because they just looked at the balance sheet and not the CEO of the company.

I also think people are making the same mistake with LMND. People are scratching their heads, at the current valuation and why shorting the company doesn't work. Once again those people are overlooking the fact that LMND is in a 4 trillion dollar addressable market, and that they have an insanely ambitious and competent management team. 

**Proof that the management team has the ability to execute:**

So far Lemonade has high employee satisfaction, is ranked #1 in customer satisfaction for insurance, they already have a product that's arguably 10x better than the incumbent's (1/10 the time to process claims and onboard customers), they're achieving \~100% YoY growth, and they're currently releasing new insurance products every 6-8 months. 

When Daniel Schreiber said the biggest bottleneck to their growth is being very careful and selective on who they hire into the company, that pretty much sold me that they will most likely become a very valuable company in the future.

The CFO also mentioned that it only takes 2 years for a customer to pay for him/herself. After that it's purely profits. Furthermore when a customer goes through highly predictive life cycles and eventually graduates from renter's insurance to home insurance, the revenues generated from that customer 6X's. That means they can continue pouring money into marketing, and will also most likely be able to keep up their insane revenue growth rate going into the future even as customer acquisition slows down. 

I YOLO'd a good amount in LMND when it was at $60. It makes up 30% of my portfolio now. I'm still not going to sell a single share, unless Schreiber or any of the management team decides to quit.",17,0.64

2021-02-10 05:08:59,DD: EXPI is HUGELY undervalued | Potential 5 bagger inside,"For my track record, here is a [DD](https://i.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ijedlg/ddse_is_an_absolute_growth_monster_dont_miss_out/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank). I did on SE where I correctly predict SE’s price 5 months in advanced. I also wrote a post about a penny stock that I cannot mention here, but went up 140% at the time of writing. Check my profile if you're interested in that. I think I have another winner on my hands: EXPI

EXPI might genuinely be the AMZN of housing. They are a real estate company that works WITH realtors so that they can buy and sell their houses. In exchange, they get a commission for helping secure the sell. Right now, they’re worth $11 billion. Their YoY growth was 99.9%, absolutely crushing Zillow’s pathetic returns. Yet Z is worth 4 times EXPI's current evaluation, at 40 billion. That’s right, EXPI is less expensive AND it is growing faster. The only thing that Z has is [revenue](https://i.imgur.com/Ok2CRoU.jpg), but if EXPI continues at its current rate, or even halves, it will still be making more than Zillow.

If you’re bullish on the housing market. EXPI is a must hold. Sure, they gained 1000%. They went from penny stock levels to small to mid-cap levels in a year. This thing will be worth over $40 billion as soon as they pass Zillow. But why stop there? They’re growing absolutely astronomically. DOUBLING their revenue is completely insane for a $10 billion company.

*****
> Stocks next week will come off one of their best months ever into a busy week of economic data and the ongoing tensions between the spreading virus and positive news on vaccines and treatments.
*****
> Another highlight of the week is expected to be Tuesday’s testimony from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin before the Senate Banking Committee. They will be discussing the emergency measures taken to help the economy after the outbreak of the pandemic.
*****
> The Dow was up nearly 13% for November so far, and if it holds its gains into Monday’s close, it will chalk up its best month since January, 1987. The S&P 500 closed at a record 3,638 and was up 11.3% for the month. The gain is its best performance since April’s 12.7%, which was the third best month for the S&P 500 since its origin in 1957.
*****
> November was a big month also for market rotation, with investors favoring stocks that would benefit from a rebounding economy and showing less love for long-held favorites among big tech and internet names. Financials were up more than 17% in the past month, and industrials rose nearly 15%, as investors bet vaccines would help the economy return to normal next year.
*****
> Tech notched a single digit gain for the month so far and lagged the broader market. But some strategists expect big tech and internet names, stay-at-home stocks, to fare better in December.
*****
> “The death of big tech has been announced over and over again, and we see that the market doesn’t abandon them, but in fact migrates to big tech whenever there are concerns,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “The post-pandemic question is whether big tech can co-exist with the small and mid-cap.” Small caps were one of the biggest winners in November, with the Russell 2000, up 20.6%.
*****
> “We did not see major selling in Nasdaq,” as investors put funds in cyclicals and value, she said. Nasdaq was up 11.9% for the month so far, slightly better than the S&P 500.
*****
> Experts have warned that there could an even bigger surge in virus cases, following the Thanksgiving holiday which could start to show up in the coming week. There have been more than 12.6 million cases in the U.S.
*****
> # Jobs report
> There are some important economic reports in the week ahead, the most important being Friday’s November employment report. There is is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday.
*****
> “My thought here is the data is going to matter because if you listen to the Fed, and if you read through the Fed’s minutes, they’re in transition here. They’re becoming more concerned about the rise in Covid cases, certainly about the lack of fiscal support,” said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities.
*****
> Strategists say another key report will be weekly jobless claims, which showed an increase in each of the last two weeks. “The employment data clearly has been weakening,” said Faranello. If it continues, it will keep a lid on Treasury yields, which move opposite prices.
*****
> Jefferies economist Tom Simons expects the elimination of Census Bureau workers to detract from the job gains in November, and he forecasts the economy added just 340,000 jobs.
*****
> “It is hard to envision a particularly strong report coming out on Friday,” noted Simons.
*****
> Bank of America economists forecast just 150,000 payrolls were added for November, compared to 638,000 in October. The private sector is expected to add 300,000, but expected government layoffs impacted total payrolls in their forecast.
*****
> Faranello said he expects the bond market to be much more active than normal this December because of the pending change in the White House, as well as the runoff election in Georgia Jan. 5 that will decide whether Republicans keep their Senate majority. The market has also been concerned about the lack of stimulus from Washington.
*****
> “The theme in the market right now is definitely hope and optimism versus the on the ground dynamic with Covid,” said Faranello. “The real question is can the vaccine rally hold up if we see the virus rise and we continue to see shutdowns. How does the market perform in light of that?”
*****
> Krosby said she expects the market to watch for vaccine news. “The question I think is now whether or not we see the emergency authorization given to Pfizer and followed by Moderna,” she said. “I think that is a catalyst to the market because that is when you will start to see the vaccine distributed.” The Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory committee has a meeting set for Dec. 10 to discuss emergency authorization for the Pfizer
*****
> Analysts expect investors to continue to gravitate to value and cyclicals, since they could have the biggest gains compared to already high priced big tech. But tech is still attractive.
*****
> “We still see the Nasdaq leading,” said Krosby. “Whereas we enjoyed the vaccine related boom in the market, the fact is that investors and and traders are looking for big tech names to give them that growth in earnings and revenues.”

> # December Almanac: Small Caps Have Shined

> December is now the number three S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It’s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not highly likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market—near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.

> In the last seventeen election years, December’s ranking changed modestly to #2 DJIA, #5 NASDAQ, but S&P 500 remains #3. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have had a field day in election-year Decembers. Since 1980, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just once in ten election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 3.0%. The Russell 2000’s single loss was in 1980 when the Prime Rate was 21.5%.

> # Sector Weights Rising and Falling

> For most of the past year, one significant trend on a sector by sector basis has been the outperformance of sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. The relative strength lines of these sectors have consistently shown outperformance versus the rest of the S&P 500 as a whole, but since August, other sectors have begun to take the wheel. As we noted in today's Sector Snapshot, just about every sector has had a banner month in November with some of the biggest month to date rallies of the past 30 years, but some sectors have seen much larger returns than others. One of the best examples of this has been Energy which has risen over 35% in November. Similarly, Financials has risen an astounding 19.5% this month compared to more modest but still significant rallies of around 10% from Tech and Consumer Discretionary. Given those large degrees of outperformance, the relative strength lines of Energy and Financials have taken a sharp turn higher in recent weeks. Similarly, they have seen a turnaround in their weightings in the S&P 500 as shown in the charts below.

> Over the past three months, the Financial sector has gained a full percentage point weighting while the Technology sector has lost 1.36 percentage points with a decline in weighting in three straight months. For Financials, that is the largest gain in weighting in a three month span since January 2017. For Tech, outside of the reshuffling in 2018 that saw a large share of its weight change into Communication Services, the last time the sector lost this much or more in weighting in three months was November of 2008. Prior to this recent string of losing weight over the past three months, Tech had seen weight gain in every month from October of last year through August. Even though the weight loss has been significant, it has only put a dent in the increased share of the entirety of the past year as the sector's weight is only back down to where it was in May.

> Similarly, looking at the other sectors, while Financials have added a full percentage point in share over the past few months, that follows nine months of declines running from last December through August. That brings the sector's weighting back above 10% in the S&P 500, but that is only at the highest level since March. Similarly, Materials and Industrials have also seen their weights rise for three and four months in a row, respectively. As for Energy, the 0.44 percentage point gain in November is set to snap six straight months of declines; the longest such streak since at least 1990. As with Financials, that turn around this month has only put a dent in the longer term trend of weight loss as Energy's weighting is now only back to its highest level since July. Opposite of Energy, Consumer Discretionary is on pace to lose weight for the first time since March.

> # A Month to Be Thankful For

> Heading into today with just three trading days left in November, the average Russell 1,000 stock was up 17.44% month to date. As shown below, not one of the five largest stocks is up even close to 17% on the month. For a market that had recently been driven higher in large part because of the five mega-cap Tech names, November has seen the mega-caps stall a bit while the rest of the market has seen broad participation. This is the type of breadth that market bulls have been waiting and hoping for.

> Of the 35 largest stocks in the Russell 1,000, Tesla (TSLA) is up the most so far this month with a gain of 43%. The other big winners include Chevron (CVX), JP Morgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Disney (DIS), and Comcast (CMCSA). Not one stock in the top 35 is down on the month, but the ones that are up the least are Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), Amazon (AMZN), and Home Depot (HD).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/largeststocks.png))**

> Looking at sectors, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1,000 is up 46% month-to-date but still down 27% year-to-date. Three other sectors have seen their stocks average MTD gains of more than 20%: Financials, Industrials, and Real Estate. Stocks in the Health Care and Utilities sectors are up the least on an average basis this month, but even these underperformers are still up more than 5%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/avgpctchg.png))**

> There are 37 stocks in the Russell 1,000 up more than 50% so far in November. Below is a list of this month's biggest winners. Coty (COTY) and Nordstrom (JWN) stand out the most with gains of more than 100%, followed by Spirit AeroSystems (SPR), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Diamondback Energy (FANG), and Empire State Realty (ESRT). The list of biggest winners this month is full of names that got hit hardest by COVID in areas like energy, travel, retail, and real estate. Notably, while these stocks are up an average of 68.5% in November, they're still down an average of 23% on the year. On a median basis, they're down even more year-to-date at -31.55%.

> # Biden - Best Since Reagan

> The market started off November on a positive note, and even after the election has continued to add to its gains. Through the close today (11/24), the S&P 500 is up 7.90% since the close on Election Day. Relative to every other Presidential election since the beginning of the S&P back in 1928, the three-week performance of the S&P 500 following this Election Day ranks as the second-best of all time. It came down right to the wire, but the only other US President to see a stronger market reaction to their election (or re-election) was Ronald Reagan in 1980 (7.97%). Behind Reagan and Biden, the only other Presidents where the S&P 500 experienced an upside move of 5%+ in reaction to their elections were Hoover in 1928 and Clinton in 1996.

> On the downside, the most negative reaction of the market in the three weeks after Election Day was the 14.75% decline following President Obama's election in 2008. In addition to Obama, the S&P 500's four other three-week downside moves of more than 5% came after the elections of Truman in 1948, the election of George W Bush in 2000 (although at the time it was unknown who was the winner of that election), the election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932, and Dwight D Eisenhower's re-election in 1956.

> In aggregate, the S&P 500 hasn't historically responded all that great in the three weeks after a Presidential election. For every one since 1928, the median return of the S&P 500 in the three weeks after Election Day has been a gain of just 0.35%. Breaking out returns by party, in the three weeks after a Democratic candidate is elected, the S&P 500's median performance is a decline of 1.11% compared to a median gain of 3.04% when a Republican is elected.

> # DJIA 1,000 Point Thresholds

> What a wild year 2020 has been! With the DJIA closing above 30,000 today, it was the second first-time upside break of a 1,000 point threshold this year. While there have only been two new upside crosses of 1,000 point thresholds, due to the sharp pullback in March from the pandemic that briefly took the DJIA below 19,000 on a closing basis, there have actually been 12 different upside 1,000 point thresholds at some point in the year.

> The table below lists the first time that the DJIA closed above each 1,000 point threshold in its history along with the total number of times the index has crossed that level on a closing basis throughout history. The thousand point level that has seen the most crosses on a closing basis was 11,000 (87 crosses) while 10,000 ranks second at 67.

> Obviously, the higher the DJIA goes, the less impactful a move of 1,000 points becomes. At current levels, 1,000 points represents just 3.3%, which is really nothing more than a very bad day in the market. Given the diminishing impact of 1,000 points in the DJIA these days, their significance declines. Even still, the twelve new 1,000-point crosses since the 2016 election has given the President (who has publicly discussed the stock market more than any other President in history) plenty of ammunition to tweet about.

> # 30,000 Reasons To Be Thankful

> As 2020 winds down, it has been an extremely tough year on all of us. Still, there are many reasons to be thankful and today we will share some reasons investors should be thankful.

> Stocks have had one of the largest reversals ever in 2020, something to be thankful for. In fact, this could be the first year ever to see the S&P 500 down more than 30% peak-to-trough and finish higher.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.25.20-Revised-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> We should also be thankful that Congress was split in 2020, likely marking the 11th consecutive year the S&P 500 gained under a split Congress. Gridlock is good they tell us and that very well could be true yet again.

> Want something else to be thankful for? We likely will have a split Congress for another two years after the two Georgia runoffs are official.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-2-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**

> Let’s be thankful that it is looking like stocks once again will be higher the year a President is up for re-election. In fact, you have to go back to FDR in the ‘40s the last time the S&P 500 was lower for the year when a President was up for re-election.

> We are thankful that we are in a new bull market, which if history plays out once again, could have a lot of life left to it. In fact, the average bull market has lasted more than five years.

> “Let’s be thankful that the huge move off the March lows was a major clue of more strength,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We noted at the time (many different ways) that the enormous move we saw off the March lows likely suggested significantly higher prices, while many ignored the market signals and instead looked for a re-test for months on end.”

> The 20-days off the March lows was the second best 20-day rally ever and sure enough, the returns have been very strong.

> We are finally seeing many stocks participate in this bull market, another reason to be thankful. In fact, the Value Line Arithmetic Index recently made new all-time highs. This index is a great look at what the ‘average’ stock is doing and is a sign that this move isn’t being led by just a few large cap tech stocks.

> Let’s be thankful that the NYSE Cumulative Advance/Decline line is at new highs. This looks at how many stocks are going up versus down and new highs are a sign of very healthy participation.

> Emerging markets have started to turn higher and we are thankful that this group could be on the verge of a major breakout to new highs, clearing their peak from 2007. As we move into ’21, this is one group we think could continue to do quite well for investors.

> We upgraded our view on small caps in September and the Russell 2000 Index is currently on pace to have its best monthly return ever. Investors should be thankful that this group is finally participating, as there are many more small caps than large caps, another sign of improving breadth, while small caps are also more domestic by nature and could be suggesting a strong US economy next year.

> Investors should be thankful for the incredible strength around the election, as the S&P 500 gained more than 1% four consecutive days. This is extremely rare, yet, extremely bullish going out a year.

2021-03-07 08:48:11,Evaluating Companies and Finding Troughs,"I recently subscribed to the Motley Fool and have spent the last several months reading and studying what I can about the stock market. One thing I mentioned on their forums and am told ""a wise investor would still buy!"" while questioning their picks was the timing. For example, they recommended buying Amazon still at north of $3K/share this month. In 2002-2003, they recommended buying it and it was $17 and it also split 7 times since that point. How would a ""wise investor"" still unquestionably buy that? Yes, it exploded 18000% but realistically will it reach north of $500,000/share? I guess it could, but seems highly unlikely. To continue to push this seems off. It seems like the average (younger with more time to take risk) investor can comfortably buy 50-100 shares of several companies for the investment of one AMZN stock. Even modest returns on those seemingly will outperform buying ONE share of an already huge expensive beast stock.

Are there any recommended resources or methods to better explore and learn about startups, emerging IPO's, etc. that might be better bets for beginning investors willing to take a larger risk? Looking at market histories even 5 years back, there are MANY companies today north of $500/share that just years ago had periods of time that might have been south of $20/share. With the Fool perspective, it would still be wise to buy the one share at $1K, instead of looking for the companies today that you could pick up 50+ shares for that much and potentially grow significantly.

NOTE: This was originally posted on r/investingforbeginners but has not received any votes or comments. Maybe because I'm an idiot with the question, but it's asked genuinely even if not based on any established knowledge base.

2021-02-23 07:53:54,Is AAPL the biggest wuss?,"yes its the biggest company, its a cash cow etc. etc. I agree with everything. They have one of the best management team however my concern is they haven't used their money aggressively like MSFT, AMZN, FB, GOOG to grow their business. Instead they did so much stock buyback, and dividend payout instead of buying companies when they had the chance like TSLA, NFLX, others... Biggest AAPL acquisition was Beats headphone business lol Now there is talk of Apple car and Apple TV already sucks. Are they just wuss? what are they afraid of in buying successful business like their competitors. 

Even though apple is the biggest company right now, thinking long term 10-15 years from now. I actually think when its all set and done, I see AMZN and MSFT to be WAY bigger companies than AAPL. Because they have shown risk taking and investing in other companies and successfully vertically integrating that in their business model

&#x200B;

TL;DR

Just to be clear, we all know apple is not going anywhere. They are still going to be printing money and growing their business steadily. But I personally don't see them to be on top in future because they are stubborn and not as aggressive.",0,0.38

2021-02-11 11:22:19,Amazon stock DD and reason to keep holding,"I bought majority of my amazon stock on sep 2020, and now I heard many people saying amzn is not moving and providing any gain for the past few month, so I am going to list few reasons that why you should keep holding the stock. 

1. The e-commerce and cloud giant has had a $5 billion share repurchase program in place since February 2016, the last time Amazon bought back any of its stock was the first quarter of 2012, so the streak is 33 quarters of no stock buyback. But with the new ceo coming, he might change and start to repurchase the stock, remember before tim cook take over apple, apple did not give out any dividend, and then it changed. 

2. Prime member engagement keep increasing and prime membership is still growing yoy. All major product categories demand continue to raise across globally. 

3. Amazon high growing aws and advertising revenue streams are getting more profitable, the advertising division could keep growing and getting some market share from fb and google.  

4. Amazon bottom line is improving much better compared to analysts predictions, the last few quarters it beats expectations by a lot. With the covid situation getting more under control, the covid related expenses will mitigate, and amazon will be more profitable. 

5. Amazon delivery fleet is growing, I have seen my packages constantly delivered by amazon vans and contractors. In the future, amazon will be less dependent on USPS, fedex and UPS, and might even able to compete with UPS and Fedex. 

6. Finally the stock split, with the new ceo coming, this might become possible as well, this will be a positive catalyst that all investors want to see.

I will be keep holding my amazon stock, if it really dip further, I will buy more, I will hold amazon stock until I retire.",25,0.83

2020-10-26 13:06:43,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, October 26, 2020. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 26, 2020**

Losses in the stock market accelerated today as new data showed an increased number of coronavirus infections in both Europe and the United States. In an effort to combat the disease, countries are once again putting restrictions in place, raising the concern of another lockdown that further harms global economic activity.

The S&P 500 (SPY) finished the day down 1.82%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 1.5% down and the Dow Jones performed the worst (DIA) finishing 2.21%.

Unfortunately, over the weekend, the US posted consecutive days of record high infection, with more than 80,000 new cases confirmed on Friday and Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. States in the Midwest of the US have been the most affected, most likely due to a resistance by the population to wear masks and colder temperatures.. Over the past seven days, the country reported an average of about 68,767 new cases every day, the highest seven-day average recorded yet, again according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Worryingly, The seven-day average is up more than 22% compared to last week, an extremely worrying increase. Adjusted for population, the Dakotas, Wisconsin, Montana and Idaho are reporting more average daily new cases than anywhere else in the country. Sadly, Johns Hopkins University reported there were 225,111 COVID-19 related deaths across the country as of Sunday afternoon. By comparison, there were 291,557 American soldiers killed in battle during World War II, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

Europe is faring no better, with countries reporting a record number of infections over the weekend and announcing a host of new restrictions. On Sunday, France reported 52,000 positive cases, a record for the country. In response, two-thirds of the country has been placed under strict, 9 p.m. curfew. In Italy, 15,199 new cases of the virus were reported, well above the previous record of 11,705. In response, the Italian government has implemented restrictions, shutting down gyms, pools and movie theaters, putting an early curfew on cafes and restaurants and mandating that people keep wearing masks outdoors. Spain, which has also been struggling with a record number of infections, declared a nationwide state of emergency and imposed a curfew. 

With the November election a mere 8 days away, the chances for the passage of additional virus-relief have all but disappeared. In a letter to her fellow Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slammed the Republicans for the failure to act in the face of the pandemic, calling their response “arrogance”. She said, “The Republicans’ continued surrender to the virus - particularly amid the recent wave cases - is official malfeasance. We must come to an agreement as soon as possible. But we cannot accept the \[Trump\] administration’s refusal to crush the virus, honor our heroes or put money in the pockets of the American people. That attitude clearly explains why the White House has not embraced the science-based path to crush the virus, which is contained in the Heroes Act.” Democrats and the White House have most recently proposed $2.2 trillion and $1.9 trillion relief packages, respectively. Despite the similar target price tags for legislation, the sides still have not resolved disputes over testing, extra unemployment insurance, state and local government relief and liability protections for businesses, among other issues.

“The best way out is through” -Robert Frost",192,0.96
2021-02-09 14:09:21,Amazon Doubles Down on Grocery,"Amazon is aggressively investing in the retail grocery business with the goal of operating 2,000 retail stores in the US blended between Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh. And so far they are killing it!

There are currently 500 Whole Foods stores and 8 Amazon Fresh stores in the US. Over 30 Whole Foods and 27 Amazon Fresh stores are currently in development.  

Amazon recently opened the doors to its newest Amazon Fresh in Northridge, California. While the store marks the banner’s third location in SoCal (joining [Woodland Hills](https://www.winsightgrocerybusiness.com/retailers/how-amazon-fresh-won-my-business) and [Irvine](https://www.winsightgrocerybusiness.com/retailers/will-amazon-fresh-crush-it-california)), dozens of additional stores in various stages of development are also underway in the area. According to Planned Grocery, additional SoCal stores are planned or under construction in Poway, Whittier, Fullerton, Long Beach, La Verne and Encino. Additionally, four locations in the Chicago area are slated to open soon. 

“Amazon seems to be putting the pedal to the metal with its grocery expansion plans,” R-5 Capital Analyst Scott Mushkin wrote. “In our view, it is hard not to see the recent partnership between Amazon and SpartanNash as a sign that Amazon intends to grow its store fleet rapidly over the next few years,” Mushkin said. According to the 2021 dunnhumby Retailer Preference Index, Amazon eclipsed top grocery retailers H-E-B and Trader Joe’s due to Speed, Digital and strong Price and Quality. 

“H-E-B and Trader Joe’s are terrific brands, yet Amazon’s unmatched convenience is addictive,” wrote Ms. Goller. “The dunnhumby stats prove consumers crave prompt home delivery, a trend that will outlast the pandemic. Even when life resumes, Just Walk Out technology at Amazon Go and rivals’ stores will set new brick-and-mortar standards for convenience, ease and time savings. Also, I expect Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh will continue to expand nationwide when the time is right. Amazon’s hungry to win and its grocery party is just getting started.”

During United Natural Foods' recent earnings call, CEO Steven Spinner expects to renew its Whole Foods contract in early 2021. From their recent 10K filling, ""We have been the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market for more than twenty years. Under the terms of our agreement with Whole Foods Market, we serve as the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market in all of its regions in the United States. Our agreement with Whole Foods Market expires on September 28, 2025. Whole Foods Market is our only customer that represented more than 10% of total net sales in fiscal 2020."" Whole Foods accounted for approximately 18% of UNFI's net sales in fiscal 2020.

During Amazon's recent earnings call, Dave Fildes, director of investor relations, said the Amazon Go Grocery format was “off to a good start,” adding there was “a lot of interest” in the technology behind it and Amazon Fresh grocery stores. 

Given the investments Amazon has made in the grocery business and the significant positive response thus far favorably positions Amazon and other grocery suppliers such as United Natural Foods (UNFI) and SpartanNash (SPTN). 

The question is if this success in grocery is short lived due to the pandemic, or will this continue once it is behind us.

I follow news and financials, but these are more internal thoughts I had moving into positions. This exercise definitely helped flesh things (positive and negative) out and gave me things to think about. I think it's something I'll be doing at year-end on an annual basis moving forward as well as exit comments on all positions. I am open to risk and my portfolio reflects that. Thoughts and criticisms appreciated!

**Investment Theses - Dec 1, 2020**

**ARKK ETF**: Technology is expanding and compounding at a rate that is hard to keep up with. The same can be said of many of the primary holdings of ARKK. These are companies that have benefited the most from how quickly the world is changing today as well as how the stock market landscape in general is changing.

**CLOU ETF**: Cloud computing is becoming more and more relevant as businesses are relying more and more on big data to optimize their businesses. While this sector has received a bump from the COVID-19 pandemic and may level off for a time, I see it as a catalyst to a sector that isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.

**QQQ ETF**: The Nasdaq has exploded over the past decade, far outpacing the S&P 500. This is the technology age, and those changes are just starting.

**TAN ETF**: As we push into the 2020s, solar energy (and other forms of clean energy) is something that is finally starting to be looked at seriously. With the massive amounts of infrastructure to be laid and work to be done, this industry won't be slowing down anytime soon.

**AMZN**: I mean, it's Amazon.

**BAC**: Huge financial institution with a long history that will be propped up by any means possible. Bank of America and other financial institutions were hit particularly hard by the drop in early 2020 and should have some further upside. This is more of a short-term idea as investors seem to be somewhat rotating back into value plays.

**DIS**: Disney is currently at a crossroads - they have the opportunity to break into the streaming revolution that is taking over the world, and they seem to be doing far better than anyone thought they would be. With a huge amount of IP, Disney has the capacity to rise to the level of Netflix (while not being a direct competitor) at a much quicker rate. Add into the mix their parks and retail side, and we should have great growth and a stable rebound moving into 2021 and beyond.

**T**: AT&T has obviously bungled their way through the DIRECTV acquisition while taking on a lot of debt to acquire it along with Time Warner. On the plus side, they've been able to effectively manage and bring their debt down due to continually strong cash flows. It remains to be seen whether they can shake off the nightmare that has been DIRECTV and capitalize on the shift to 5G as well as HBO Max.

**V**: Credit and debit cards are far from ubiquitous in the US and even more so in other areas of the world. Visa remains the company to beat in the space.

**CRSP**: The secret to the future of medicine lies in CRISPR (gene editing) technology. If this technology can be harnessed in the way it is imagined, the potentials are without end. The technology is still in the nascent stages and will undoubtedly face many delays and challenges along the way. This combined with the fact that CRISPR Therapeutics is not guaranteed to come out on top in the sector (although they are well-positioned) makes this is still a speculative but somewhat safe play.

**DKNG**: Betting on outcomes in life is something that the average person does every day. Throw sports, money, and easy accessibility into the mix, and you have a perfect storm. DraftKings already has a strong presence in their fantasy lineup pools. Now states are dominoing to legalize online sports betting as not doing so will lose them out on a lot of taxes as people cross state lines to place their bets. 2021 will see an explosion in the sector.

**FUBO**: A synergistic investment with DKNG, fuboTV is the ultimate streaming platform for all things sports. They've spent the past several years building up quite the library and consumers have no problem shelling out $60 a month in order to access it. As ESPN bleeds under DIS, consumers will flock to the streaming service that provides all of their sports needs: fuboTV. One of their most interesting ideas is how to work live sports streaming in conjunction with sports gambling.

**LULU**: The king of athleisure, Lululemon is here to stay, and it's safe to say that lines that come out of Lululemon stores even during the pandemic show just that. Sound financials throughout 2020 and seem to be poised to come out of the pandemic in a better position than they were in before. It will be interesting to see how they leverage their acquisition of Mirror.

**U**: You can mine for gold or you can sell pickaxes. While gaming might not quite be a gold rush industry, it has shown a lot of solid and steady growth over the past decade, and we are starting to move into the next generation of gaming. This growth will continue as more and more of Gen Z get older. Unity is well-positioned but will need to see if they can capitalize in the upcoming years.

**VRYYF**: A very small Canadian plant-based meat company that had its IPO in mid 2020. The products are great and in line with the growing population of vegetarians and vegans. Their demand is currently too high, and they cannot ship product in a timely fashion to consumers. They've acquired several new plant locations that could show huge expansion in their production as well as the US market.

2020-04-13 23:11:07,"Please rank AMZN, GOOG, MSFT and AAPL for investment.","I am trying to understand the story before investing into them.

Between these 4, can some one summarize strengths, growth potentials and valuations. I am late to stock market investment (15 to 20 years from retirement). I want to start investing 401k and other retirement funds. I have my own savings to invest as well. What are the earnings and growth opportunities, we are expecting for next 1- 5 years.

I think, AMZN has lot of growth potential with all in one package (retail, fmcg, Streaming and AWS). How big AWS going to be in terms of contributing AMZN market cap.

AAPL has still long way to go in terms of selling phones and other stuff. They are like windows of mobile phones. They are even replacing windows in laptops. They own mobile domain.

GOOG has lot of ad revenues. I am not too sure about all the other stuff they do.

I am not sure about MSFT story. It is growing into cloud space. They missed big time in mobile space like Intel. They have strong office suit and windows. I think, they have big windows stack/servers for enterprise applications.

I am also thinking about COSTCO. It has nice concept of selling limited skus in big quantities. It has its own private label which can be as big as P&G.

Am i understanding these stories correctly? Please feel to correct me and give me some numbers and future earning/market cap potential.

2020-03-21 11:24:24,"Yes, this is the bottom for AMZN and WMT","Over the last few weeks I was doing what most of us were probably thinking about doing, trying to sell some equities before the market bottoms out. Obviously the hope is that I can use the extra cash to pick up some value stocks and be in a good position for the eventual market rebound. While I was considering my holdings, I noticed that AMZN had only fallen 15% or so, roughly half the amount that the S&P had fallen. I happily sold off a share, thinking that I was getting a good deal, and that surely I could earn a better return on that capital by putting it into something like XOM or CVX. I think a lot of us still think of Amazon as a provider of consumer discretionary goods, but that isn't the case at all. They can be used for all types of consumer staples, and their orders have been surging since the social distancing began.

The decrease in consumer spending won't matter to the giants like Wal-Mart and Amazon. Maybe their earnings will miss estimates, but it doesn't matter. The reduced consumer spending will destroy small businesses, and AMZN and WMT will be right there to pick up the market share. Amazon announced this week that they will be hiring 100,000 new workers. WMT and AMZN will come out of this pandemic in a stronger position than ever before, and guess what? The smart money is already there, WMT is trading at an all-time high.

Stop making bets on stocks that ""look cheap"" or ""will probably be bailed out"" (BA, RCL), and think about who stands to gain the most from the destruction of small businesses. Companies with strong balance sheets that will weather this period of reduced spending and capture the market share left behind by small businesses is where the true opportunities are.",4,0.59
2021-01-18 18:50:19,$LOGI Q3 Earnings Blowout... expecting other gaming companies to follow suit,"1) Q3 sales were $1.67 billion, up 85 percent in US dollars and 80 percent in constant currency, compared to Q3 of the prior year.

2) Q3 GAAP operating income grew 248 percent to $448 million, compared to $129 million in the same quarter a year ago. Q3 GAAP earnings per share (EPS) grew 222 percent to $2.22, compared to $0.69 in the same quarter a year ago.

3) Q3 non-GAAP operating income grew 214 percent to $476 million, compared to $152 million in the same quarter a year ago. Q3 non-GAAP EPS grew 192 percent to $2.45, compared to $0.84 in the same quarter a year ago.

4) Cash flow from operations was $530 million, compared to $181 million in the same period a year ago.

This obviously destroyed expectations, and this might actually gap up Tuesday morning. If we extrapolate a little and consider the fact that the majority of their revenue came from gaming and computer peripherals, we might expect similar results from other publicly-traded gaming/peripheral companies (e.g. $HEAR, $CRSR, $RZZRY) and e-commerce giants like $AMZN.

The facility is expected to be completed in 2022. It will be Amazon’s third fulfillment center to use robotics technology in Tennessee and the company’s eighth fulfillment center in the Volunteer State.

Separately, Amazon AMZN is also building an operations hub in Nashville that is expected to create 5,000 jobs in the area.

“Over the past year, Amazon has announced projects in each of Tennessee’s grand divisions, accounting for nearly 3,000 new jobs,” Lee said in a statement. “As we continue to navigate through the pandemic and reboot our economy, we know our recovery is supported by the success of our Tennessee businesses.”",26,0.87
2020-11-02 06:15:04,"Stock market news, updates & predictions , Should you Buy or Sell Now? [2-11-2020]"," So Friday we saw the stock market down again as the dow fell almost 0,6% percent while the s&p fell over 1% and the nasdaq was crushed being down almost 2and a half percent as This last week we saw the dow fell 6,5% the s&p 5,6% and the nasdaq 5,5% as all 3 ended the month of october down more than 2,3%

One good thing for the US economy is that the retail stores sales has recovered and consumers are still spending excess cash especially with the holidays and black Friday up next. I believe that as much as Tuesday is important for the economy, the events that will come later in the week as the FED holds two important meatings and the latest jobs report comes in at the end of the week far outweight that

As you can see the New York Federal bank economic index is still rising, that sugests a V-Shaped recovery is continuing in the US. This index takes into consideration lots of important data from the economy.

The unemployment in the US has been decling but that rate has sharply slowed down in the last months as it’s still more than double the 3,5% at the start of the year as the latest number from September was almost 8% rate of unemployment.

As you can see the most affected people are still the middle and low wage under 60k/year. As the high wage jobs unemployment rate is barely down 0,5% since January.

So the fear in the stock market saw a huge pop in the last week as the VIX (the volatility index) rose from 27,55 more than 10 points to close at over 38 this last week. This next week is probably the last with such high volatility as the upcoming big events will pass and more certainty will be in front of us . The volatility was so high as we retested the June highs and have seen a pullback 3 times after hiting those levels.

Despite strong earnings last week from all big tech companies (Alphabet,Amazon,Apple, facebook and Microsoft) the companies stocks dropped amid the broader stock market sell-off with the exception of Google which posted terrific numbers to crush analysts expectation.

Apple is down almost 19% since the highs of September and has lost 450 billion dollars in market cap since then.

This dropped in the company has been caused by a broader stock market sell off as well as missed iphone revenues. I do believe that iphone revenues will see a huge spike in the next coming quarters as apple customers as myself will finally upgrade from older iphone to this next generation iphone which is the first to have 5G technology as well as other great improvements in capability as well as camera.

A couple analysts have recently changed they’re target to between 132-140 which is over 20$ from where it sit’s today. That is quite good upside for the company.

As you can see they are barely down 2,7% year over year in product revenue despite not having the new iphone launch included in this financials, and overall the company still saw a 1% increase in revenue due to the huge spike in services revenue that I believe will continue especially with the Apple One bundle just being launched at the end of last week. The Total Gross margin also increase slightly but I expect this to be just a small drawback in the short-term.

Also I believe that Amazon was dragged down because of the next quarter predictions of huge costs while they only forecasted a operating income of 1 to 4 point 5 billion dollars which is below what was anticipated despite amazon web services continuing to be the largest player in cloud spending. With a 32% share of total market and a revenue of 11,6 billion dollars which Is up 29% year over year, while Azure from Microsoft comes in second and google cloud in third. There is still a lot of room to grow for all of this companies as there is still over 37% of the market provided by other companies. Also this is a great company to own for the long term as digitazation and online commerce will continue to grow, some are estimating that by 2030 amazon could have annual revenues of 1 trillion dollars $ while using conservative projections of compound annual growth for e-commerce of 10%, for the cloud services of 15% and for ad revenue of 20%, amazon could hit that mark by then. But I believe this is possible even faster than that.

Facebook is the one company that I will have to analyze more in this group. They will be hit with privacy issues do to the regulatory risk and Apple’s announced privacy changes. But I still do believe this to be a great company as they also own Instagram, and I really like how that part of the company is innovating and growing.

While google seems to be back on track as the company was the laggard in the group. They have become less reliant on the search ad revenue as growth in Youtube ads and Google cloud will push the company to renewed growth in the future.

Alibaba will see two big events this week as they will kick off the singles day event next week, extending the event with 3 more days rather than the usual 24-hour event, in which they will also double the products on offer. Also another big event will be the IPO of ant Group in which Alibaba will still have a big stake. I believe they are a great company the forward revenue growth estimates of 31% are higher than other tech companies like amazon, google and Microsoft while the P/E for the company is the most attractive of the group also.

Ford just announced that late next year they will introduce a lower priced competitor for Tesla AutoPilot and GM’s super cruise, this is great news for the company as they seem to be improving the company continuasly.

Some important earnings coming this week are :

Paypal on Monday, which I believe is the greatest fin-tech company, on

Wednesday Qualcomm will announce that will be a great insight to see what Apple’s iphone 12 is doing as Qualcomm is the biggest supplier for apple and on Thursday Alibaba (with ant group ipo) coming also on the same day this stock could see a surge in value.",15,0.77

2020-09-01 11:22:39,"Walmart VS Amazon, the next big online retailer (Walmart DD). Why my money is on Walmart","**Walmart Due Dilligence**

**PARTNERSHIPS**

\- Partnership with Instacart

Recently Walmart and Instacart have founded a partnership that will allow Walmart to use Instacart their same-day shipping service. \[Walmart and Instacart together make up for nearly 50% of the online grocery sales.\]( [https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png](https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png)) Walmart’s vast inventory and Instacart their network and experience will only strengthen their position as the dominant grocery delivery providers, and thus putting more pressure on Amazon.

\- Partnership with Shopify

In addition to Instacart Walmart has also partnered with Shopify. This new partnership will allow third-party sellers to directly sell their item’s on the Walmart marketplace. This new partnership will greatly expand Walmart’s inventory while giving small businesses the opportunity to reach a bigger demographic. Walmart is expecting to add 1200 Shopify sellers in 2020. Listing an item on Walmart’s marketplace allows Walmart to pick up some fees and generate greater traffic to the website. Another interesting possibility to consider is the fact that Walmart could be used as a Shopify returns hub, with a Walmart being within 10 miles of 90% of the US population it is the ideal candidate for further strengthening their relation with Shopify and saving both parties a lot of money.

\- Partnership with ThredUp

Walmart has also partnered with Thredup. ThredUp is basically an online thrift shop for clothes and wearable’s. This brilliant partnership means Walmart can now offer both normal and high-end clothing on their marketplace for an affordable price and expose customers to nearly 750,000 pre-owned items. Who would’ve ever thought you could tell someone that you bought your Michael Kors or Calvin Klein at Walmart.

\- Google

Walmart has been partners with Google for over 3 years now. This partnership allowed Walmart to enter the domain of voice ordering groceries. Simply ask one of your Google devices to buy milk and it will add milk to your Shopping cart. This Partnership might just be the beginning of a strong bond between Google and Walmart as both companies are interested in competing with Amazon.

\- Microsoft (+ Possible TikTok acquisition)

Walmart has been partnered with Microsoft for about 2 years with 3 more years to go.

Since the partnership Walmart has been using the full range of Microsoft cloud solutions in a bid to accelerate their digital transformation, innovation and efficiency.

**Acquisitions**

\- Bonobos, ModCloth, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, Parcel

Let’s start at the beginning, with these acquisitions Walmart stated entering the e-commerce market in 2016-2017. Sadly as is known none of these are particularly success stories with the companies being sold again, being discontinued or CEO’s leaving. However Walmart learned a lot from these companies and has used this knowledge to further try to expand in the e-commerce market.

\- Jet.com

The first big step in the fight against Amazon. When amazon acquired Jet.com it was a clear signal of what its intentions were. Jet.com was one of the fastest growing U.S. e-commerce companies and Walmart acquired them in September 2016. Since then a lot has happened, Jet.com has been discontinued but the knowledge, progress and technology gained due to Jet.com is irreplaceable and has given Walmart a brilliant boost into the e-commerce with their e-commerce sales increasing 29%. Furthermore (ex)CEO of jet.com Marc Lore is now the CEO of Walmart’s e-commerce.

\- Flipkart

Ever heard of the small startup company called Flipkart? Maybe you have not, you should though. Flipkart owns 35% of the Indian e-commerce market, a true giant. Walmart acquired Flipkart in 2018 and ever since then it has been expanding its influence in India and fighting against Amazon for market dominance. This year Flipkart took over Walmart’s 28 Indian stores in order to expand its wholesale growth. Another interesting thing is that Walmart might make Flipkart public within the next 3 years.

\- TikTok acquisition

Some very recent news of their Partnership with Microsoft is to potentially acquire TikTok. TikTok’s enormous userbase and the current pressure in the US and India have made for an interesting situation causing the partnership to push forward in the bid to acquiring TikTok. In my opinion Walmart has a very decent chance of getting TikTok and making it work. One factor that plays a big role in this is Walmart’s presence in India due to Flipkart. Flipkart is India’s biggest online store for; phones, electronics, books, home appliances, etc. With Walmart having a presence in both countries where TikTok is (going to be) banned might mean some positive things for the future, but for now that is speculation. The acquisition of TikTok would allow Walmart to use its genius algorithm and massive userbase to further promote and integrate its Walmart marketplace.

**Walmart PLUS**

Word is finally out, in September Walmart will be launching its Amazon competitor called Walmart plus. It will give numerous benefits to the user such as; Unlimited free delivery(with 2700 stores having same day delivery), fuel discounts and scan&go a tool to make shopping faster, all for the price of $98 per year

**2 Hour Delivery**

Walmart recently launches its new delivery service, called Express Delivery. This new service will allow customers to place their order online and receive their groceries (for a 10$ fee) within 2 hours. Walmart express delivery is currently available in 800 stores with plans to expand to 2000 stores. In addition to 2 hour delivery Walmart also offers same-day delivery in almost the entire United States.

**5000+ US stores.**

This is Walmart’s biggest weapon. The thing Amazon lacks the most is physical stores. Walmart has over 5000 stores while Amazon has just over 600 (worldwide!). If Walmart can find a way to combine e-commerce with its enormous physical presence then it could give Amazon an absolute run for its money. Remember that 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart.

**Some other interesting facts to consider.**

\- 90% of US population live within 10miles of a Walmart.

\- Walmart’s e-commerce sales are currently up 97%

\- Walmart’s expansion in Africa, India, China.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion/TLDR**

Let me first state with you that this has been my first Due Dilligence and that English is not my first language.

Walmart is currently the underdog, and not many people are expecting them to properly fight Amazon. However its recent spree of partnerships and acquisitions have been a brilliant and very clear move in the direction of e-commerce. If Walmart fully utilized its massive physical network together when their growing fresh e-commerce, I see no other outcome then for Walmart to grow, grow, grow. Covid has given Walmart customers the push they needed to fully explore Walmart their marketplace, the marketplace that is now starting to fill up with thousands of sellers and endless products. Walmart VS Amazon, here we go, my money is on Walmart.

2021-01-10 20:10:08,My Top 5 Growth Picks for 2021,"#1) Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ)

The Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ) follows the immensely well known Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) by investing in the 101st to the 200th largest NASDAQ listed companies. These companies are less mature than those in the NASDAQ 100 but with high growth potential.

The top holdings of QQQJ include Roku Inc (ROKU), Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (CRWD), The Trade Desk Inc (TTD), Zscaler Inc (ZS), Enphase Energy Inc (ENPH), AstraZeneca PLC (AZN), Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO), Old Dominion Freight Line Inc (ODFL), Fortinet Inc (FTNT), and Coupa Software Inc (COUP). Many of the most popular growth companies are included in this new ETF.

#2) VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH)

The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF tracks the semiconductor industry--one of the hottest industries of 2020. It isn’t hard to be bullish on semiconductors when they are required by virtually all companies. Electric vehicles have put the spotlight on many semiconductor companies in the race for autonomous driving.

The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) has top holdings including: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), Nvidia Corp (NVDA), ASML Holding (ASML), Broadcom Inc (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD), Texas Instruments Inc (TXN), Intel Corp (INTC), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM), Micron Technology Inc (MU), and Analog Devices Inc (ADI). Semiconductors have had a killer year and the outperformance will likely continue in the future as demand for semiconductors increases.

#3) Salesforce.com, Inc (CRM)

Salesforce.com, Inc (CRM) develops cloud computing solutions for customer relationship management (hence the ticker “CRM”). Salesforce recently announced it was acquiring Slack Technologies (WORK) for over $27 billion. This deal was one of the largest acquisitions announced in 2020. Salesforce has fallen almost 15% since the acquisition announcement on fears it is overpaying in the Slack acquisition.

However, Salesforce has continued to crush earnings estimates in the last quarters of 2020 with analyst consensus that this growth can continue. Salesforce operates in a growing market and continues to be the number one choice for customer relationship management.

#4) Array Technologies, Inc. (ARRY)

Array Technologies, Inc. (ARRY) is in the business of solar tracking solutions and services. The Company currently provides the DuraTrack solar tracking system and SmarTrack which is software that automatically adjusts module angles to compensate for environment changes.

Array is quickly growing revenues with earnings and free cash flow remaining positive since 2019. The Company has stated its plans for continued growth and its willingness to make acquisitions. Array Technologies is a direct bet on the future of solar energy which will likely benefit under a democratic Whitehouse. This Company allows investors to invest in the future of solar without investing directly into solar panels.

#5) Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX)

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) focuses on the treatment of cystic fibrosis through several drugs and has several ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of other diseases. Vertex collaborates with an impressive list of companies, including CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP), Moderna (MRNA), and Merck & Co. (MRK).

Vertex Pharmaceuticals has proven itself to be competent in developing market-leading drugs and securing lengthy patents on its treatments. The Company will continue to dominate the cystic fibrosis space in the future due to limited competition.

I couldn't have run Amazon as profitably as Jeff Bezos, but I could have written a MUCH better departure (as CEO) announcement letter.


It's disappointing that the leader of a company with infamously LOW employee morale would completely neglect to call out and thank his sorting center and warehouse backbone. Instead, he essentially announces his position change by telling those workers, ""You're welcome,"" for the $15 min wage. 😩


Had he used the opportunity to rally his blue-collar drivers, pilots, loaders and sorters (who empower his bread & butter ecommerce & delivery service), in addition to the white-collar (SaaS/Cloud/etc.) ""inventors"" that he exclusively focused his letter on, he could have invigorated his workforce at a time they need it most. 


Attrition is coming! 


I rate $AMZN a HOLD, because while the profits are redonkulous, the poor working conditions and low morale will cost the company $Billions, especially when competitors resume hiring in a post-covid economy.

Their average price point is at 328.36. The most Conservative rating is at 300. The most ambitious is at 355.

Seems like a good, solid stock, as opposed to the meme stocks you hear about daily. A good entry point for this stock right now after the weakness last couple of days.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 1st, 2021.

# **Wall Street braces for bumpy trading in the week ahead as the GameStop short squeeze unfolds - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/wall-street-braces-for-bumpy-trading-in-the-week-ahead-as-the-gamestop-short-squeeze-unfolds.html)**
*****
> Earnings news from Amazon and Alphabet, the important January jobs report and Washington’s discussion of stimulus could all be important to markets in the week ahead, but none of it is likely to get more attention than the short squeezes driven by retail investors.
*****
> Stocks had a rocky week, with the S&P 500 down 3.3% to 3,714. The S&P was down 1.1% for January, its first negative month since October and a warning for the year, according to the old Wall Street adage.
*****
> “We were due for some type of decline. We’ve been straight up since October. It’s not unusual that we’re backing off a bit,” said Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities.
*****
> Trading could remain bumpy in the coming week, as the S&P 500 struggles to hold above 3,716 its 50-day moving average and a key technical level.
*****
> “This is the first time we’re at the 50-day moving average since early November,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “It’s just a level we haven’t seen in a while and it’s an important first line in the sand of whether the market uses this as a pivot spot to bounce again.”
*****
> “The buy the dip mentality doesn’t die easy, but if you break that [50-day], that portends something else,” he said.
*****
> Massocca and others see little impact on the broader market from the phenomena of retail investors piling into stocks that are being shorted by big investors. Fueled by no fee trading, retail investors created a flurry of trading in GameStop and other heavily shorted names, like AMC Entertainment. If the stocks rise, in theory, the firms that are short sellers will have to buy stock to cover, and that activity could drive the price even higher in a so-called short squeeze.
*****
> GameStop was the poster child for that trade this past week. GameStop shares closed 68% higher on Friday, bringing their gain for the week to 400%. The retailer’s shares hit a high of $483 on Jan. 28.
*****
> “This is somewhat isolated,” Massocca said of trading in GameStop and other shorts. He said it may not be a phenomena for that long since there aren’t that many heavily shorted stocks. “I think they may be hunting new names.”
*****
> The short squeeze story has garnered broad interest, in the general news media and from Washington.
*****
> Lawmakers from both parties are eager to look into the fact that Robinhood and other online brokers restricted trading in the hottest short names when trading was frenzied. Robinhood said it was responding to SEC rules on net capital requirements and clearinghouse deposits that brokers have to comply with.
*****
> “This was the busiest week for earnings reported with 82% of the companies reported better than expected earnings. It’s a really good quarter, but obviously overshadowed by the short squeeze news,” said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management.
*****
> He said some of the biggest tech names have been lagging, like Apple and Microsoft.
*****
> “The combination of demanding valuations and short squeeze news has overshadowed a really good performance of corporate earnings so far,” Grohowski said. “We’re constructive on the market. Fundamentals do look encouraging to us.”
*****
> Strategists have expected a pullback in the first part of the year, and many say it would become a buying opportunity. Hedge funds did sell long positions in the past week, but firms like Morgan Stanley and Barclays say the de-leveraging is not likely to have a big impact on stocks.
*****
> But for investors who end up buying in at the end of the short squeezes, they could feel some pain.
*****
> “I do think this isn’t going to end well,” said Grohowski. “These kind of one way trades they don’t end well particularly for those that come later to the party.”
*****
> “I think this will be one of those,” he said. “GameStop is not worth what it is trading for today. I do believe at the end of the day the value of a company is important and it’s going to be driven by fundamentals. These dislocations and distortions of value, they will correct and many will be hurt by that.”
*****
> But Grohowski said it’s encouraging that the surge in retail activity was driven by younger investors.
*****
> “We’ve wanted for some time for this younger generation to be more interested in the financial markets and equity investing,” he said. “I know a lot of experienced market participants were not anticipating it being this way. It’s not just a one time kind of distortion.
*****
> “I think this is thought-provoking in terms of a way a younger generation might be looking at investing, by their rules, not the rules of the traditional market participants,” Grohowski added.
*****
> He expects the January employment report to get some attention Friday, and it should be weaker with just 50,000 to 60,000 jobs added.
*****
> He said the markets will also monitor the progress of stimulus discussions in Washington, as valuations have risen on expectations of a package coming soon. President Joe Biden has proposed $1.9 trillion in spending, but Republicans are not in agreement.

> # How Stocks Perform in a President’s First Year

> 2021 kicks off the first year of a new four-year presidential cycle. One of the most popular questions we’ve received lately is how have stocks performed historically during this political year.

> For starters, the S&P 500 Index historically has gained 6.8% per year during the first year of the four-year presidential cycle, but stocks have done better when the president was re-elected than when someone new occupied the White House. This makes sense, as a new president could bring new policies and potential uncertainty. Additionally, stocks do better during years three and four under a new president, while they are much weaker early in the cycle.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.27.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, breaking down all the quarters of the four-year presidential cycle shows that the first quarter of the first year in the cycle is one of only two quarters with a negative average return.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.27.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Bigger picture, historically the fourth quarter of the year has been the strongest of the year, with the first quarter the second best on average. Don’t forget, the third quarter is usually a weak one. Please note, below is for all years, not just the first year of the cycle.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.27.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

> We will take a closer look at February returns next week on the blog, but it is worth noting that when a new party is in power in the White House, historically stocks have struggled from late January until early March. “It is interesting, but from around the time of the inauguration to several weeks out, stocks tend to be pretty weak,” according to LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “It may be as simple as new leadership could bring with it new policies and added uncertainty”.

> # Will GameStop Stop The Bull Market?

> “In the short term, the market is a popularity contest. In the long term, the market is a weighing machine.” -Warren Buffett

> The incredible action from some of the most heavily shorted names has investors everywhere wondering what it all means? GameStop (GME) specifically has taken the country’s imagination by storm, as the stock started the year under $20 per share and this morning nearly hit $500.

> Please note, we aren’t allowed to discuss individual equities, and in no way are we recommending any stocks in this blog, but from a bigger perspective, what is happening here? Basically, individual investors are using message boards like Reddit to find some of the most shorted stocks, then they all pile in at the same time, forcing large institutions to cover their shorts, and thus producing massive buying pressure.

> LPL Research doesn’t think these parabolic moves reflect an overall unhealthy market, but institutions covering shorts at sizable losses may be removing capital from some big cap names. “While these developments could be another sign of excessive optimism in certain segments of the equity markets, we do not believe they represent a sign of a broader market bubble or indicate a major correction is forthcoming,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Don’t forget, overall market breadth is extremely healthy and the credit markets are functioning just fine—we don’t see a repeat of 1999 like some are claiming.”

> Lastly, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, after a 72% rally in the S&P 500 Index (and more in small caps and the Nasdaq), maybe it is simply time for a break. After all, the current bull market has tracked almost perfectly the start of the 1982 and 2009 bull markets thus far, and both of those took a break for a few months starting around this point in the cycle.

> # Most Heavily Shorted Stocks at the End of 2020 and Now

> In the table below, we show the 20 stocks in the Russell 3000 that currently have the highest short interest as a percentage of float. It should come as no surprise that GameStop (GME) still tops that list with 122.97% of float short as of the most recent data for mid-month. That is even after a 21.36 percentage point drop from the end of 2020 when 144.34% of shares were short. It was also the most heavily shorted stock then. The runner-up is Dillard's (DDS) which currently has 83.04% of shares sold short compared to over 90% at the end of 2020. Again, despite that sizeable decline in the percentage of shares sold short, it was also the second most heavily shorted stock one month ago. Of the rest of the top 20, there are six other names with lower short interest than the end of last year. Looking across the rest of the most heavily shorted stocks, Sumo Logic (SUMO), American Well Corp (AMWL), and Sunpower (SPWR) are the stocks that have seen their short interest as a percentage of equity float rise the most. In terms of stock price performance, SPWR has been the one with the biggest rally having doubled YTD. The only other stock that has doubled YTD in this cohort has been GME.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012921-Short-2.png))**

> In the table below, we show the stocks that have seen the biggest changes in the percent of shares sold short between the end of 2020 and the most recent data as of January 15th. Those currently in the top 20 most shorted stocks are highlighted in gray. Across the entire Russell 3,000, 1,777 stocks have seen their short interest as a percent of short move lower in the two week period from the end of December to mid-January. As shown, even after the massive short squeeze that has taken place, GME is actually not the stock that has seen the biggest decline in shorts. Relay Therapeutics (RLAY) holds that title with a 22.62 percentage point decline. That is even though the stock has experienced a relatively smaller move than some of its peers. Granted, a number of other stocks like nCino (NCNO) and Berkeley Lights (BPYU) to name a few have actually moved lower so far in 2020 and have also seen their short interest decline significantly. On the other end of the spectrum, WW International (WW) has seen its short interest rise the most.

> # Funding Markets Full of Cash

> US funding markets are awash with liquidity thanks to ongoing QE purchases by the Fed and the progression of fiscal policy since the end of the year, as well as normal seasonal tailwinds that see more liquidity after year-end balance sheet constraints would roll off. Funding markets refer to collateralized, short-term lending via repo and related wholesale cash transactions.

> Government money market funds that are allowed to conduct repo operations as well as buying Treasury and Agency debt are seeing roughly typical inflows, but those come on top of record share of overall money market funds. As a result, repo rates have been plunging. The secured overnight financing rate, which tracks the volume-weighted general collateral repo rate has fallen to 3 basis points above the bottom of the Fed Funds target range. While repo rates falling below the Fed Funds target range wouldn’t be a catastrophe and some parts of the market have gotten there, it’s not in the FOMC’s interest to have funding rates trading far outside its target policy rate range on a regular basis.

> The solution already exists, of course: the NY Fed has a standing overnight reverse repo facility first introduced back in 2013 which is likely to start draining cash as investors seek higher returns than the repo markets offer. Reserve scarcity, which roll-off brought to bear in 2018 and 2019, is now reserve plenty, and so many reserves exist that the NY Fed will start draining them with reverse repos. Reserve balances will continue to grow this year thanks to QE purchases and an expected decline in the balance of the federal government's transaction account at the Federal Reserve.

> # Federal Reserve Rebukes Hawkish Rumors; Reaffirms Support

> It has been a busy past 12 months for the Federal Reserve (Fed), after the onset of the global pandemic prompted historic stimulus from monetary policymakers. With the economy showing signs of being in the early stages of expansion, some have speculated that the Fed may begin to slow the pace of its asset purchases. Recent comments from some Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members that have hinted that the Fed’s bond buying program could be reduced by the end of the year, has signaled that other policymakers may be thinking that way, too.

> Adding fuel to the speculation, the 10-year Treasury yield has been climbing, breaking above 1% for the first time since March 2020 as the economy has expanded. Meanwhile, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, breakeven inflation rates—the yield difference between Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and nominal Treasuries—have risen to levels not seen since 2018, suggesting that inflation expectations are heating up, although levels still remain largely benign.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week ahead r/stocks.",27,0.9
2021-02-03 06:54:35,My attempt at the “Reddit ETF”,"Reddit (and social media in general) has, in my opinion, a very interesting mix of strategies and approaches when it comes to trading/investing. A good portion here are looking for short/medium term gains with mild risk. Some play it safer, investing in index funds and ETF’s relying on long-term growth. Another percentage is looking to get rich quick, dumping their life savings into a single stock. 

I know the idea for a “Reddit ETF” has been floated here before, and I personally believe that with the aforementioned mix of DD/risk tolerance, it would perform exceptionally well. With several users posting a weekly recap of the most discussed stocks, I have decided to pull 10 stocks from these lists and invest $150 in each of them, totaling $1,500 in this “ETF.” The “Reddit ETF” consists of the following. 

-ARKK
-MSFT
-AMZN
-ICLN
-SPCE
-AAPL
-PLTR
-TSLA
-BB
-NOK

As much as I would love to invest more, I have a particularly small portfolio at the moment (life meant I had to pull most of my investments last year. Needed the money for immediate use). However, I do plan on contributing additional funds on a weekly basis to help grow. My questions for Reddit are as follows

-Is 10 different stocks too many? Too few? 

-At what point should I drop or sell of an underperforming/less discussed stock? Should I reevaluate the stocks included in the ETF weekly? Monthly? 

-When investing additional cash, should I evenly divide my investment across all stocks (I.E. if putting in an additional $150, put $10 in each stock)? Or should additional investments favor the better performing stocks?

I would love any feedback or suggestions! I plan on posting updates on a semi-regular basis (probably once or twice a month).

-Sorry for the formatting issues, I’m on mobile",4,0.64
2021-02-03 14:45:08,My portfolio after my first day. Please criticize me so I can grow!,"\[02/03/21\]

Let me start off by saying that I did not intend to hit the ground sprinting towards ongoing short squeezes such as GME (because I fully suspected I would have hit the ground with a ""splat""). Instead, I allocated a majority of my initial funds towards what I, with my nearly non-existence knowledge, believe are safe stocks. You will see a couple of repeats below because I bought extra during dips (I have not yet sold any stocks, but have purchased them with market orders and limit orders (no options at this time)):

AAPL: 3.716111 @ $134.55

AAPL: 0.745907 @ $134.06

NOK: 5.509362 @ $4.54

I'm hoping to hear some feedback so I can avoid mistakes in days to come, and repeat anything positive (if they exist). Thanks in advance!",2,0.67
2021-02-02 11:10:50,Will stocks prices fall after the pandemic?,"&#x200B;

|Stock|March 30th, 2020|February 1st, 2021|
|:-|:-|:-|
|APPL|60.35|134.14|

&#x200B;

It makes sense that Amazon grew fast since March 2020. A no brainer really. You get deliveries to your door, avoiding COVID-19.

Then there's Apple, amongst others stocks, like Square, and Shopify. They have also grown faster since  March 2020.

Do you think these will fall once the pandemic is over? I'm wanting to buy Apple and Amazon. However, I will hold off on Amazon because I believe it'll dip after the pandemic, but will hold a lot of value because Amazon is really convenient. That leaves me with Apple. Firstly, I don't see why it grew a lot faster, and if it is cause of the pandemic, I don't see why it would stay where it is?",8,0.76
2021-02-08 05:40:35,(2/8) Monday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading week! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Monday-

# [4 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-8-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Wall Street set to rise after best week since November

> * Dow futures pointed to an over 100 points gain at Monday’s open, an advance that would exceed the 30-stock average’s closing record and could top its intraday all-time high, both of which happened last month. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Friday closed at record highs, while the Dow’s gain was about 40 points shy of a closing record as a disappointing January jobs report boosted hopes for further economic stimulus to help Americans and U.S. businesses during the pandemic. All three stock benchmarks logged their best weeks since November. The Reddit-fueled trading frenzy around short-squeeze names receded as shares of GameStop lost 70% last week, even with Friday’s 19% gain. The previous week, the video game retailer’s stock soared 400%. Shares rose 12% in Monday’s premarket trading.

*****

> # 2. Yellen says Biden stimulus could result in full employment next year

> * The U.S. economy could return to full employment in 2022 if President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue package were passed, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Sunday. Long-term unemployment is around a historical peak. While Biden has said he wants to get GOP support for his Covid relief measure, Democrats are taking steps toward passing his approach without any Republican votes. Republicans have opposed the $1.9 trillion price tag and called for lowering the income cap for receiving the full $1,400 direct payment.

*****

> # 3. Trump impeachment trial starts this week

> * Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, one of Donald Trump’s harshest Republican critics in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, said Sunday he sees a conviction of the former president at his impeachment trial as “very unlikely.” Trump’s unprecedented second Senate impeachment trial will start on Tuesday. With a 50-50 split in the Senate, it would take 17 Republicans voting with every Democrat to convict. If Senate does so, it could also vote to bar Trump from holding office again or getting certain perks reserved for former presidents.

*****

> # 4. South Africa suspends plans to use AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine

> * South Africa has suspended plans to inoculate its frontline health care workers with AstraZeneca’s vaccine after a small clinical trial suggested it was not effective in preventing mild to moderate illness from the variant dominant in that country. The disappointing early results from the study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, indicated that giving the AstraZeneca vaccine may not be useful in South Africa. In the U.S., AstraZeneca’s vaccine has not been approved. Only vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have been approved for emergency use so far by the FDA. One from Johnson & Johnson will be reviewed later this month by the agency’s vaccine advisory committee.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

2020-03-08 11:08:06,AMZN is Undervalued in this Environment,"Obviously, Costco's stock benefited from social media pictures and news articles depicting mobs buying emergency supplies in vast quantities. On the other hand, Amazon has no way to visually show their sharp increase in revenue from this virus panic. 

AMZN is only up 2.9%YTD compared to 5.9%YTD for COST. AMZN is the higher growth company as well. 

In summary: IMO Amazon's revenue will surprise in the next earnings report due to mass buying of supplies because of the virus.",5,0.69
2020-11-30 16:16:42,My portfolio is currently 43% in cash. Where should I put it?,"I came in to some money in September and have it in a brokerage account. I have been investing it slowly over the past few months and have already closed a few successful positions for nice gains. (CEQP, MRO, MAXR and WORK). I have not yet invested all the cash. I am interested in both trading plays and Long term investments. I am ahead in each of my 10 current holdings. Here is a breakdown of my current portfolio:

Cash - 42.8%

ARKQ - 8.5%

ARKF - 7.7%

ARKG - 6.7%

ICLN - 5.9%

RXT - 5.8%

CVS - 5.6%

PACB - 5.2%

RKT - 5.1%

SWCH - 3.9%

ACI - 2.7%

This account is separate from my 401k and my Roth, I also have an online account, but that is only about 20% the size of this new account.

Just looking for opinions from the hivemind. I would be interested in buying some of the big names,, I just like to time my entries. My strategy so far has been to swing some trades to load profits into my etf's. In hindsight, I should have just thrown all the money in at once, but I chose to just drop some in each week. I have been thinking about some metals etf like GLD. I have also given some thought to putting something in UVXY to hedge against a large dip in the market. What else should I be looking at? Thought about jumping into AMZN today as well.

Just looking for ideas....Thanks!",43,0.83
2021-01-15 20:47:59,AMAZON BULL FLAG,"Okay folks, lets talk AMZN. They have been consolidating in a tight $3000-$3500 for about 6 months now. It’s looking weak. Anyone else here holding shares in hopes of a great upside break? 

Maybe even a stock split? We all saw what happened when AAPL & TSLA did one. All thoughts are welcomed.",8,0.65
2019-12-13 07:43:51,"Over the next 40 years, will AMZN continue to rise?","I ask this because I am preparing to buy some shares for my retirement portfolio (I am currently 24yo). I can't seem to see any reason why not, does anyone have some advice?",2,0.61
2021-02-12 19:29:52,TSLA autonomous and robo taxi bear case,"I have been hearing TSLA different bull theory for years now. And for past 3 years, it has been autonomous technology and robo taxi. And how this is going to be a trillion $$ sector on its own. How stupid is that? Do people not know Waymo, Zoox exists? They already have working services in west coast and we hardly hear about them. So I am trying to understand how Robo taxi and autonomous helps tsla justify this valuation but doesn't help GOOG and AMZN at all. Because they can actually vertically integrate these services into their business. Imagine Booking a waymo ride from Google Maps which is already installed on like BILLIONS of devices? same with Zoox, they can integrate it with Amazon Prime membership

TL;DR

Don't buy into the TSLA cult when they try to sell you on autonomous and robo taxi. There are other tech companies like NVDA, AMZN and GOOG already ahead of the game with vertical integration in their products

Edit

Go to Waymo and Zoox YouTube channel, unfortunately when I put a link my post is getting deleted",4,0.57
2020-11-26 03:56:09,Amazon and its omnipresence,"Today I was thinking about how a company as big and powerful as Amazon can still have room to grow, both as a stock and as a company itself. 
It seems like Amazon is literally everywhere and has every single product you can imagine, plus the stock price they have is pretty high (not saying overvalued, just high from my perspective). 

Can you think of any way that this company could still grow? 

I thought about expanding more its market in Asia, as far as I'm concerned it isn't as popular there, right? 
Also, I thought on an improvement in delivery, for instance, partnering with companies like Workhorse to use their drone technology and renew their way of delivery? 

Those are the only scenarios where I could see Amazon growing even more, other than that I think that such a monolithic company has to stagnate at a certain point in terms of growth. 

Thoughts?",3,1.0
2021-02-04 14:09:50,"Mid 20s never really cared about saving money, until reading more into the stock market. Am I the only one? Few questions","First of all, I'm not entirely sure if posts like this are appreciated within this sub reddit, I apologize if not. 

So to cut a long story short; I'm mid 20s and was never really about saving money. I just spend it how I wanted. If I look at my friends they never really saved a lot of money either, I don't know if that's a generation thing but whenever I speak to older people (incl my parents). They can't stress enough how important setting money aside is and that they started doing so from a young age onwards. I'm well aware that setting money aside is always a good thing to do, I just could never really find the motivation to do so. Except for when I planned to buy something big in the near future, such as my car/vacations). Been working since 18 never had any money problems whatsoever I make a decent living as a long haul trucker, whilst I'm still young and can put these kind of hours in I really should start caring more about setting money aside for later. If anything ever breaks down like a washing machine I could buy a new one instantly at all times, so to a certain point I do ''save'' money. Just by far not enough I think.

However, years ago I was already really interested in the market (Reading The big short in 2012 started it) but came to the conclusion that it was too hard to understand for me and I shouldn't step into it without knowing what I was doing. I still feel that way although I have a better understanding of it now.

I'm not in this with the illusion to become rich, make it my career or any of that. I just want to start setting money aside and I feel like this way it keeps it interesting for me and motivates me to put any money I have left over for that month, for example, to put into my trading account. 

The question I do have however is; Would it be a ''wise'' decision for me to start saving money by putting it into my trading account? And what is the best market for me to focus on, should I focus on big players like MSFT/AAPL/AMZN? I'm not asking for you to literally tell me where to put my money in. But perhaps you could guide me in the right way, I really don't mind taking long positions as in the end I'm only doing this to start myself off setting money aside and be more careful spending money in general (Read; don't spend it on a whole bunch of dumb/unnecessarily stuff). 

Or would I be better of putting my money in a mutual fund/my savings account?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I greatly appreciate any reactions and may you have any useful/interesting information for me then please do not hesitate to share it. (Items I could read up on etc).

&#x200B;

**$AMZN** \- Absolute beauty of a triangle. A break put either way will be happening, and I hope up. RSI is oversold, Stoch low, and Vortex consolidating. It is at support, this could be massive.

**$BTG** \- Great value here, possible low of $5.00. Channel play possibly developing. All indicators are super low, this could be a big move. 

**$CDXC** \- Great area of value at support here. Good channel play, may drop to $4.50, which would be ideal. All indicators are fair but Stoch is low which is also good.

**$CERN** \- 50EMA bounce play possibility. Support area as well. May dip to channel of value as well. Indicators are fair at best as it is stull up trending.

**$EMP** \- Area of value channel right here, possible support. It did break so we shall see. Indicators are low, so a reversal is upcoming.

**$ERIC** \- Gorgeous channel up here, at value and above 200EMA. Support area, double bottom, great setup. Vortex and Stoch super low which is great.

**$GRBK** \- Volume resistance acting as a support, channel up, and support -- above the 200EMA line. Stoch low, but other 2 are fair at best.

**$GRPN** \- Old resistance as a support now, and old pattern resistance as support too? Stoch low, Vortex Low, RSI fair.

**$KPTI** \- Possibly 200EMA bounce but I will be greedy and hope for $15. But this is a support area it could be huge. Stoch and Vortex low, could be some really big move here.

**$LAMR** \- Channel up, right now at support and 50EMA. If it lives here it could be a great play. Stoch low but other 2 consolidating.

**$MLCO** \- 200EMA and support working together right now. Stoch and Vortex low which is good, this could be another easy 5% move.

**$MORF** \- Uptrend, 200EMA line and support as well which is awesome. Indicators are all low so that also great. Real nice calm setup.

**$MTOR** \- Up trending channel that is bouncing off the 50EMA lines. 

**$PEAK** \- Uptrend / triangle forming here which is gonna be awesome. Support under it as well, so it can make some easy money. Vortex is very low.

**$PGEN** \- Uptrend channel also at support, if it lives here we will be in a great position. All indicators are low and curling up.

**$PNW** \- Double bottom at support, and looking to reverse. All indicators are low so we should see a reversal soon.

**$RVP** \- Simple up trending channel. Bouncing off the 200EMA, and near support. Indicators all fair at best but it is looking good.

**$SUI** \- Ascending Triangle looking tasty here. Vortex low, Stoch fair, and RSI fair, but that makes sense. If it goes the full move here it will be a big breakout.
