# LITTLE GUY BECOMES MARKET'S BIG MOVER

**By** **Tim SmartFebruary 2, 1999**

Cathy Wilkinson and Vinnie Cunning are two of the reasons the American economy is on fire. Both are avid investors in the stock market -- Wilkinson a novice, Cunning a veteran -- but each shows the way Wall Street has evolved in the past couple of decades from a province of the wealthy to a marketplace for the masses. Their experiences and behavior show how far the market permeates daily life for many people, so much so that now chatting about stocks has replaced talk about real estate as the topic du jour of the middle class. ""It's everywhere, it's at the water cooler, it's in the bars, it's at the beach,"" said Fairfax financial planner and investment-guide author Ric Edelman. ""When you turn on sitcoms, there's starting to be jokes about mutual funds. 

There is definitely a cultural change going on. Ordinary Americans are beginning to recognize wealth is within their grasp."" Just ask Wilkinson, a 45-year-old mother of four in Dewey, Ariz., who listens to the morning market commentary on National Public Radio while driving her children to school in her 1999 Volkswagen Beetle. The children regularly check their mother's portfolio on the personal computer and offer tips, recently egging her on to buy shares in Walt Disney Co. ""I have a pretty specific goal in this E-Trade account,"" she said, referring to the online brokerage she uses to buy and sell stocks. ""Any money made is to go to their {private-school} tuition. That was my lofty goal when I set it up."" 

A market novice who began buying individual stocks a month ago, Wilkinson boned up on finance by reading specialty periodicals such as Barron's and watching financial news networks such as CNN/fn. ""In reading, I was convinced the stock market was a good place for our money,"" said Wilkinson, who has about $75,000 invested. Her major holding? E-Trade. Like many new to online investing, Wilkinson concedes she initially became obsessed with surfing the message boards on the Motley Fool, an Alexandria-based company that is a modern-day equivalent of the village green for electronic investors. But lately, she said with a laugh, ""I've really been cutting down. I check in in the morning and then in the evening."" 

Alexandria mailman Cunning, on the other hand, doesn't even own a personal computer and he lacks cable television, too. But he does enjoy watching ""The Nightly Business Report"" on public television each evening. Cunning, 58, has been investing steadily in the market since the early 1980s, religiously putting the maximum $4,000 annual contribution for himself and his wife into individual retirement accounts, as well as contributing to a federal savings plan. He owns a broad array of mutual funds, from high-tech to large-cap growth stocks. He's had his share of losses, but the overall trend is up. ""From 1982 up to and including 1999, I have never missed a contribution and as I sit here and talk to you, my IRAs are over $300k,"" said Cunning, who mostly favors mutual funds but has also taken to some individual stocks. 

Economists and market experts say investors like Wilkinson and Cunning -- not the so-called ""smart money"" on Wall Street -- are the reasons behind the greatest bull market in history and, in part, what is already the longest domestic peacetime economic expansion ever. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan may fret about inflated stock values, questioning whether they reflected ""irrational exuberance,"" as he did two years and 3,000 points ago in the Dow Jones industrial average. But the 43 percent of adult households that now have money invested in stocks are having too much fun to stop. Even Greenspan may be softening, noting as he did Thursday that there is some economic logic behind the current frenzy in Internet stocks. Greenspan compared the Internet stock boom to a lottery, in which the size of the potential jackpot induces bettors to buy tickets -- despite the fact that most ticket holders will lose money. 

The trend of populist investing has been evolving for some time, starting with the removal of fixed commissions on stock trading in the mid-1970s, and gaining steam with the development of tax-advantaged retirement plans such as the IRA and 401(k) in the 1980s. But it picked up speed with the advent of affordable and accessible computer technology and now is on afterburn with the expansion of the Internet into everyday life. ""Without the Internet we wouldn't be able to do this stuff,"" said a 53-year-old worker for a District-based international organization who did not want his name used because he trades at work. The World Wide Web is full of online brokerages that offer trading costs as low as $8 a pop, or about one-tenth the amount full-service brokers used to charge. ""We all thought we could never invest against these professionals,"" the investor said. ""Now we're more skeptical."" 

There are lots of ways to measure this explosion of interest in the market among ordinary people, but a few statistics paint the picture: The number of investment clubs sanctioned by the National Association of Investors Corp., in which people of like interest place equal amounts of money into a pot to play the market, has doubled in the last three years to about 37,000, representing around 700,000 individuals investors. Assets under management at Charles Schwab & Co., the company that made the discount stock brokerage business respectable, reached $491 billion at the end of last year, a 39 percent increase in 12 months. The company has added 1.6 million new accounts in the past two years, bringing the total number of Schwab accounts to 5.6 million. In the fourth quarter, 61 percent of all Schwab's daily trades were conducted online, up from 41 percent a year earlier. 

In 1985, there was $105 billion invested in 401(k) accounts. At the end of 1997, the number was close to $1 trillion. The number of companies sponsoring plans for their employees, meanwhile, rose fourfold to 267,000. Nearly a third of the plans have average balances exceeding $50,000. In 1990, investors poured $12.8 billion in new money into stock mutual funds. By 1997, the most recent year for which data is available, that annual flow of cash into equity funds had hit $231 billion. Behind the numbers are real people, with real aspirations and apparently an almost limitless faith in the power of stocks to make them rich. It's a dramatic shift in sentiment from earlier generations, who lived in the shadow of the Great Depression and were largely indifferent to Wall Street. 

""For a long time, there was the specter of 1929,"" said Thomas O'Hara, chairman of NAIC, the investment association. ""You had parents and grandparents telling kids not to invest in the stock market. We think, probably starting around 15 years ago, that has run its course."" The thirst for stocks is even driving the economy, powering a binge of consumer spending that has been rising at a rate faster than income growth and producing the surprisingly robust 5.6 percent growth in national economic output, or gross domestic product, in the fourth quarter of last year. In fact, some market gurus and economists now half-jokingly say the market is the economy. They may just be right. While the nation's GDP is around $8 trillion annually, the current value of the stock market exceeds $14 trillion. ""People have become owners of the system,"" said Dan Carper, the partner in charge of marketing at Lord, Abbett & Co., a New York money management firm. 

This ""democratization"" of the market, as some call it, received a huge boost from the spread of IRAs, 401(k)s and other retirement accounts over the past two decades. They enabled companies to turn over to many workers much of the responsibility for building retirement nest eggs, turning employee At the same time, direct grants of stock, or options, have become a more common form of employee compensation. Once a perk mainly confined to Silicon Valley start-ups, options are now enjoyed by tellers at Norwest Bank in Minneapolis and shipyard workers at Newport News Shipbuilding in Virginia. As people of all ages become more aware of the stock market, they become more comfortable with its risks, analysts say. 

Along with investors under age 30 who are too young to remember the last protracted downturn in the market (a quarter century ago) are the baby boomers, many scrambling to make up for lost time. ""Baby boomers are the first generation ever looking forward to retiring at 70 and lingering around for another 25 years,"" said Deutsche Bank Securities economist Edward E. Yardeni. This herd-like behavior, of course, scares the daylights out of many long-term professional investors and economists. When the Dow fell nearly 20 percent last summer, some of them saw it as a much-needed correction that would bring investor expectations back down to earth. ""This has been the best market of all to say, I can do it better on my own,' "" said John Markese, president of lthe American Association of Individual Investors. ""But this market is going to go sideways and even down for a while and these people will fall off in droves."" 

But so far, the individual investor has hung tough -- and behaved in a way that continues to confound the experts. Last year, after a period that economists classified as the worst financial crisis in a half-century, the Dow recorded its third consecutive double-digit annual increase. ""I think we're really just at the tip of the iceberg with the impact the individual investor is going to have on the market,"" said Mike Riley, who recently sold a golf course in Dayton, Ohio, for a handsome profit and is now investing $50,000 of his money in stocks of companies such as Dell Computer Corp. and Yahoo Inc. ""There's a whole different group of people out there."" They include people like Cathy Wilkinson, whose first month in the market was marked by a wild ride with Internet and other high-tech stocks. Showing the faith that is characteristic of the new breed of individual investors, Wilkinson said she'd stay the course if the market crashed. ""I'd still hang in,"" she said. ""I don't think I'd sell anything right now."" Furthermore, she said, what happens in the market isn't going to fundamentally alter her economic outlook or behavior, she said. ""I don't think it will change the amount of shoes I own.""
