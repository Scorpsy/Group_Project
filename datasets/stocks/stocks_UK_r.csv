2021-03-31 03:24:10,UK stock ideas,"With the uk tax year coming around, I’m sure people are looking for UK stocks to buy into UK isa’s (reduce currency risk). Just thinking it would be a good idea to have a place to discuss UK stocks that have your attention or interest. 

I’ll start the ball rolling 

1) Tesco: grew market share for the first time in years and is currently at a bargain price. Seems to be finished with their failed experiments internationally and looking to refocus on what they’re actually good at. 

2) Unilever: simply anti-inflation because inflation has me worried 

3) Rolls Royce: surely at this price it either increases or goes bust, and I don’t see it going bust. 

4) DS smith: I see great growth opportunities as online shopping continues to increase. They’ll manage to lower costs and improve profitability too. Just not too sure if the current price has this built into it. 

5) BATS: sadly, the products they sell aren’t going anywhere and demand will always stay there no matter the climate. Highly profitable, good dividend, not sure why it’s as cheap as it is.",33,0.86
