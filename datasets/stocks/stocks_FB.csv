2021-01-20 12:23:19,TikTok finally beat $FB in monthly time spent on the platform per user,"It’s unlikely this has any major ramifications for FB stock at the moment but looking long term, TikTok is a major competitor that has the ability to divert young smartphone holders away from FB.

2021-03-05 16:17:39,Help with Facebook (FB),"I have seen many say FB is undervalued. It has an impressive revenue growth for its size and very attractive P/S and other metrics people like to look at. Their balance sheet is very healthy and their cash flow is amazing. But things are more complicated.   


I started looking at their last earnings and the picture is not that clear. Their impressive revenue growth is coming mostly from the improved margins. They seem to be doing a fantastic job optimizing the machine. However, user growth is very slow which is a huge red flag. There's also the privacy fiasco which will probably hurt their margins, but that's for me at least not a big concern like user growth.   


Now, here is why it's complicated. They don't show a breakdown of Instagram vs Facebook. The number of daily/monthly users seems to exclude Instagram and Whatsapp. In that case the slow user growth is less concerning, since we all know that Instagram is much more popular with millennials. They seem to intentionally make it very difficult to understand what's really going on.  Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Any docs I missed?",3,0.8
2021-02-13 11:39:40,($FB) Facebook Undervalued,"Facebook looks to be undervalued by up to 20% in this current ""probably inflated"" market.

I did a quick comparison between FB/MSFT/GOOG/APPL.

Obviously, these companies are not direct competitors but due to size and industry, they seem worthy for a little comparison.

&#x200B;

**P.E** \- FB: 26, GOOG: 35.14, MSFT:35.86, AAPL:36.72

**Revenue-growth 2020 -** FB: 22%, MSFT:14%, GOOG: 13%, APPL: 5.4%

**Average revenue-growth (3 years)** \- FB: 29%, MSFT:14%, GOOG: 18%, APPL: 6%

**FB Average P.E for the last 6 months**: 29.5

&#x200B;

**Market Cap**: 770bn

**Equity:** 128bn (61 of which is liquid assets/cash)

It is clear that Facebook is still growing at a faster rate than other companies, but this does not seem to be priced in.

Even is it reaches a 6-month average price based on P.E you could see a quick 10% + return

If bogey analysts are your thing.. strong buy sentiment here: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB/analysis?p=FB](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB/analysis?p=FB)

&#x200B;

**Risks involved**: Apple has made it clear that it will tackle FB's ability to extract data from iPhone users and track their activities online. This could have a significant impact on future revenues.

Government regulation(EU/USA) around free speech and data protection is a touchy subject and could cause problems for Facebook.

2021-02-09 00:08:08,"Impact of Apple iOS14 on personalized ads (FB, SNAP, SHOP)","This stratechery article [https://stratechery.com/2021/an-interview-with-eric-seufert-about-apple-facebook-and-mobile-advertising/](https://stratechery.com/2021/an-interview-with-eric-seufert-about-apple-facebook-and-mobile-advertising/) does a good job of explaining the impact of Apple iOS 14 changes to digital marketing. Apple is making it almost impossible for Facebook and other apps to get 3P conversion data i.e. did customer purchase the product on nike app after they clicked on the Nike Ad? This data is what allows advertisers to truly measure the effectiveness of their ad campaigns. This conversion data is fed into MachineLearning algorithms which makes the targeting better and allows Facebook and other social media companies to show relevant ads. Personalized ads also helps to keep small apps free of charge. These free apps might need to change their business model unless they can survive on non-personalized ads.

The market is pricing in the impact of this change to FB but I'm not sure if it's pricing this in to shopify, snapchat and other similar businesses that rely on personalized ads. Shopify sellers use personalized ads to drive traffic to their niche products. Going forward, it's going to become difficult for these small businesses on Shopify to acquire new users. What do you all think?

Facebook and Apple war was inevitable if you've been paying attention. Apple made a shift to services in 2015 after slow growth in hardware sales. Apple saw how much money Facebook et al were making on mobile app install ads and felt entitled to a cut of it. Facebook app has been getting bigger every year with more apps and services into Facebook like Games, Instant Articles and it has started to look like an app store. See [https://mobiledevmemo.com/coming-war-apple-facebook/](https://mobiledevmemo.com/coming-war-apple-facebook/)

Apple's own apps are exempt from this which gives them an unfair advantage over their competitors. Right now they are just blatantly privileging themselves by allowing their own apps to track users without the prompt. This is just another example of Apple holding themselves to a different standard when it comes to “privacy”.

""Facebook sells data"" crowd is one of the most misinformed crowd on the internet. It is patently and obviously false to anyone who has ever advertised on Facebook. The idea that Facebook (or Google) makes money from selling data is facile and dishonest. So please avoid commenting on this thread if you're just going to say ""FB/Google bad"".

2020-11-22 17:02:27,"I draw with crayons so you don't have to. Last week I closed up 1.9% for the week. Here are my plays this week: FB, KR, MSFT, NVDA, SHOP.","r/Stocks, I've been tracking my performance the last several weeks by selling theta and occasionally entering share positions. I normally post in the Options sub-reddit but just like my portfolio that is diversified in 4 stocks, I'm diversifying where I post my plays. This week I have a few positions where I will be buying shares. I thought maybe you guys would like to see my plays.

**Here are the last 3 weeks of returns**

&#x200B;

|**Week**|Buying Power|Profit/Loss|Return|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|$75,000|$4,000|5%|
|2|$79,000|$1,600|2%|
|3|$81,000|$1,500|1.9%|

&#x200B;

**What am I doing?**

I do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 1 to 3 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own. As a backstory I nearly blew up my account doing WSB-style plays in March but have regained all of my account and then some running this strategy since April. What I do now is basically wheeling on weekly puts.

I watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays & levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.

&#x200B;

**Here's a few things regarding my strategy**

**1.** I don't do spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see spreads as a ""Theta Gang"" play and is still very high risk.

**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.

**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.

**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads, only put-selling!

Honestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.

# Open Positions From Last Week

**LULU:** 1x LULU 18 Dec 2020 PUT @ $310 strike. Currently up 45% on the play.

This is holding a lot of my buying power. I'm already up 45% on the play on the run-up it's had so far last week. Waiting for the last 40-50% profit might be laborious since the option will begin to lose theta & delta as the stock price increases. Up 45% in a few days why wait another 2 weeks for the remaining 40%? I will be looking to sell this option once it hits 60% profit or so.

# Chart Rules

**Pink Lines** = Trading range & channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.

**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.

# Master Plays This Week

**FB - Facebook**

Facebook has been on a slow and steady uptrend staying within the pink channel. It's tested support a couple times on weakness and bounced cleanly off them each time. Stock price at $269 (nice) is currently at the lower range of the uptrend channel. I think we'll see some continued momentum upward. If we get another re-test of some lows I think we will find some support at $260 and again at $250. IV is pretty low for facebook, so buying shares and selling weekly covered calls at 0.15 delta for a little extra premium might be better return than put-selling.

**Positions on the watch:**

Dec 18 $260 PUT sold to open. Premium collected: $610, return: 1.5% in 4 weeks.

Break-even price would be if the stock closes below $253.90 by December 18 (currently $270).

OR

100x shares

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**KR - Kroger**

Kroger has always been a boring stock. I've labeled in purple where Buffet announced his stake. The stock shot up after the news and has been range-bound staying between $31-$34 with a slight uptrend. I think KR will react somewhat similar to WMT's stock price with a slow and steady upward grind. If so, we are at the bottom of the channel looking for continued momentum upward. Kroger reports earnings in 2 weeks and might provide a little extra premium on some plays.

**Plays on the watch:**

Dec 11 $31.50 PUT sold to open. Premium Collected: $65, return: 2% in 3 weeks.

OR

IV is low again, so owning some shares and selling CC against might also be a good move.

&#x200B;

**MSFT - Microsoft**

Classic Microsoft, not really doing much until it does. This chart only displays the last 6 months, but zooming further out you will see MSFT only goes up, albeit rather slowly. Last 3 months it's been in a slight uptrend bouncing between the $200 and $215/220 levels. Currently at the bottom of the trend channel, and might see some continued momentum going up. Big time support at $200 if we do see a little dip.

**Positions on the watch:**

Dec 18 $200 strike PUT sold to open. Premium Collected: $240, return: 1.2% in 3 weeks.

OR

Buying shares and selling covered calls.

&#x200B;

**NVDA - Nvidia**

I am very bullish on NVDA in long-term. This is another ticker that will benefit as the world shifts even more-so on the tech side of things. They have been server revenue massively and they are no longer just a gaming chip company. Very bullish uptrend even if another round of covid quarantines and lockdowns hit. I think we can see this ticker re-test the $560 level and have another break-out. Otherwise we might see downtrend back to $500 or $510.

**Positions on the watch:**

Options are pretty expensive here. Best play in my opinion is to be purchasing shares outright.

&#x200B;

**SHOP - Shopify**

Shopify has been within the same range since June. A few times it almost broke out of the $100 level, but was pulled right back in. The stock price is sitting at the lower end of the uptrend channel and close to the $1,000 support/resistance. If it breaks through this time look for some confirmation up above and into the $1,100 zone. I do like e-commerce long-term and think SHOP is at the very top of this list when you think e-commerce.

**Positions on the watch:**

Options here are also very expensive, I think I might purchase some shares and look for a quick 3-4% pop this or next week.

&#x200B;

I'll be posting an update tomorrow morning with more potential theta plays and what I've entered.

Time to dial in your trading, let's get this bread.

&#x200B;

**MONDAY 11AM - UPDATE**

I normally post screenshots, but it's not allowed in this sub-reddit. Here are the positions I've enter.

FB - December 18 $260 put. $600 premium collected.

KR - purchased 500 shares and sold 5 covered calls for Dec 11, $34 strike for $300 premium collected.

MSFT - purchased 100 shares

NVDA - purchased 30 shares

SHOP - purchased 15 shares.

The market took a little dip and my positions are down $400 for the day. No need to stress, I'm a HODLer anyways.

Will post an update if I close any positions!",582,0.93
2021-01-25 05:04:35,Stock Market News for Today | PLTR / GM / AAPL / TSLA / FB / MSFT & Other Stock Market News [01-25],"**Stocks close out the week with big gains as Big Tech comes back in flavor. The earnings frenzy starts with Apple, Tesla, Facebook & Microsoft reporting. GameStop, GM & Ford spiked last week, let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of Friday as we saw most of the stock market giving up some of the big gains of the week, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/ZxdGSkm) losing .30% & the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/MRn5Q40) Industrial dropping 179 points while the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/F3wm2d8) barely managed to post a small gain for the day as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/JRkwsZn) ticking up a little but finishing under 22 for the week, with the Nasdaq gaining 4.2% in the short week the SP500 rising 1.9% and the Dow Jones posting a .6% gain.

About 55% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/hFF1hSm) were advancing on below average volume as the number of companies moving above the moving averages still remains very high. We only saw 3 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/pPJpQCk) posting small gains for the day while the biggest losers were the value play in Financials, Energy and Industrials, all losing more than .50%

For the week we saw communications outperform with a big spike after Netflix reported earnings, while Energy had more than one ugly day dropping big on Monday, Thursday and Friday.

Small-caps faired better to close out the [week](https://ibb.co/y0C39gJ), with all 3 groups posting gains of more than 1.5% while Large-Cap Value companies underperformed losing more than 2.5% for the week, as Growth Companies & Especially the big-caps finally outperformed this week, gaining 2.3%.

Here is the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/MnWSRV4), which was a pretty mixed bag, with Apple posting a big gain ahead of the earnings report while the other big tech companies also posted small-gains. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/BfYRHWS) though, we saw huge gains in most of the big tech names with all the FAANG names and Microsoft gaining more than 5% for the week, while Banks alongside Oil & Gas companies were the biggest losers

We also got some economic data on Friday as existing home [sales](https://ibb.co/KWxRW9m) rose again while the inventory is still at all time-lows of under 2 months of supply while the January [PMI](https://ibb.co/x54dqCy) current read came in at 58, way above the 55.5 expected and 55.3 in the previous read as both the Services and Manufacturing PMI saw a spike of more than 2 points

This week we also start the [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/2nsRvBx) frenzy, with AMD which might benefit from Intel’s drop last week, Microsoft & Starbucks reporting after Tuesday’s close as JNJ might also give some updates regarding their vaccine, while big value companies like Boeing, AT&T & Caterpillar report before the open on Wednesday & Friday. We also have some of the big tech names reporting on the same day, with Apple which is expected to have their first $100B quarter, Tesla & Facebook reporting after Wednesday’s close which might be a bigger volatility moment for the market depending on how the results come in.

In terms of economic [data](https://ibb.co/Fx6TWyw), we start off [today](https://ibb.co/4K4DDvp) with the Dallas FED Manufacturing survey but the most interesting ones are on Thursday & Friday, while we also wait to see what the FED announces in terms keeping the rates low & the money printer going with asset buying on Wednesday.

In some other stock market, we saw [Palantir](https://ibb.co/zV2vxft) soar on Friday, rising more than 25% to break the $30 levels after they updated their Demo Day scheduled for tomorrow. It’s expected that they will reveal the latest developments in their big software platforms and also reveal [new](https://ibb.co/swYH61R) software platforms that will continue to help the company grow such as SDDI, Low-Code/No-Code and other modular strategy software.

We also saw [Ford](https://ibb.co/D8cmmZn) soaring again, as the company is having the best monthly performance in more than 10 years and spiked more than 6% after JP Morgan upgraded the company based on their new product line which is what I’ve been saying about the company in some months now. Tesla is going to face serious competition in the next decade with all the other car manufactures pushing harder and harder into the EV world, with some of the most popular cars out there like the F150, the Bronco and other models joining the sector that will continue to improve and might actually become a good alternative to Tesla’s models. It’s the same with others like [GM](https://ibb.co/42G3ttK) which might be a good catch-up play compared to Tesla. By the way… [GM](https://ibb.co/vPwbPCs) is outperforming Tesla recently based on their developments in the EV & self-driving sector.

Meanwhile, [GME](https://ibb.co/bXYsj4k) had a wild day on Friday, gaining more than 50% despite being even higher as the battle between WSB & the shorts continues, with this move making Citron’s Left deciding to avoid further talks about the company probably in an attempt to avoid future attention at the GameStop short squeeze. Short Squeeze has seen a big rise in terms of [search](https://ibb.co/qn51BPH) interest after these latest moves in the GameStop stock and might even put more pressure on the bears, as retail investors might pump up this stock even more.

So, guys, this week might bring a lot of volatility depending on many of the important events we have. Earnings seasons & especially big tech results will be important to justify these high multiples most of the tech names have received, while we also have to see how the GDP comes in, as it is expected to have seen a 4% growth for the 4th quarter while the FED is under pressure to keep the money printer on and the rates low, if not, or if there is any doubt in their commitments and also some numbers come in worse than expected we might see the long-awaited correction/pullback. But I don’t think numbers or the FED are going to disappoint really, but that doesn’t exclude the possibility of the pullback… keep investing safely & have some money available to buy the dips if they appear, use them as a buying opportunity, not a panic sell.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/929L2rz) are pointing to a very good open, with the Nasdaq leading the way up almost 1%

Lemonade rises by more than 20% again while reports continue to come in on the Apple Car. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a big rally in the stock market after the [Biden](https://ibb.co/QpPkkvg) confirmation and Trump called for a smooth transition with the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/sw8bKdb) recovering the previous day losses and closing at over 13K. We also saw the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/MnjT8BH) gaining almost 1.5% and finishing over 3800 while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/ykPckZD) also posted a gain of over 200 points to close at just over 31k with all 3 of the big indexes finishing at new records. This broad rally pushed the [VIX](https://ibb.co/5MY0P1w) down, as the volatility index finished the day lower by more than 10% as 9 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/nmc7x8X) finished in the Green with Technology leading the way up 2.7%, while Utilities was the biggest laggard dropping by 1.3%.

Growth companies largely outperformed [yesterday](https://ibb.co/XpHGdhb) with both small and large cap growth companies posting big gains across the board, while value plays lagged behind, as 2/3 of the companies were advancing [YESTERDAY](https://ibb.co/NLLMyLY) with over 300 new highs on average volume.

So, let’ take a look at the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/ys6zg6M) from yesterday, as big tech companies flourished with the likes of Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Nvidia, Tesla and many more posting gains at least 2%, while most of the losses were concentrated in the Chinese stocks that are being delisted and the more value heavy utilities sector.

Yesterday we also received the investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/10gRPgn), which saw a worrying move in the stock market, as bullish investors surpassed 50% of the total investors and is near the 1-year high from November. Most of this move to the bullish side came from neutral investors, which are way below the historical [average](https://ibb.co/XbyKxjB), which probably decided to get back in the market, rushing in the clean energy sector, the industrials and many others after the Democrats swept the Georgia election. I remind you that I usually use this survey as a contrarian indicator, when sentiment moves to this much greed in the market, I usually don’t like to add to my positions, as I await to buy stocks on red days.

We also received some economic data yesterday, as we saw December’s homes for [SALE](https://ibb.co/7Y3njz3) fall to an all-time low, below 700K as the housing market keeps on booming, with homes selling faster by about 2 weeks compared to last year while the national inventory dropped by almost 40% since last year, as the median listing price was $340K, up over 13% since 2019.

[Today](https://ibb.co/t4bS0wH) is a quieter economic day, with the biggest number coming in the early morning as we wait to see the non-farm payrolls.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Nikola](https://ibb.co/DLP8f1P) joining the broad rally in the EV [STOCKS](https://ibb.co/mJgVqwr) yesterday which pushed almost every single stock higher, while we also saw a report from JP Morgan on some possible good developments on their trucks. I don’t believe in this company, it’s bad history, bad management and reputation will hurt it in the long even if they manage to develop a decent product, which is still to be seen, as they haven’t really brought anything innovative to the market.

One other stock that rose yesterday was [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/FbZZ5Lz), as the stock spiked more than 27% yesterday, after the company was pitched by the Motley Fool yet again. I really like this company, and I think it has major disruption potential in the insurance world, so I agree with this report. The stock did suffer a slight pullback about a week ago after a report from The Friendly Bear but I don’t believe it will have a long-lasting effect, as I believe this stock has great growth potential.

[Apple](https://ibb.co/Xzscpk6) also seems to be confirming the previous reports and is in talks with Hyundai about a development of a self-driving EV, as we heard something about this from Hyundai before some confusion made them kind of back out of the previous statement. This report is pretty much as anticipated, as Apple would probably be looking to either collaborate on manufacturing with a traditional car manufacturer or actually just acquiring pretty much any one of them.

We also saw [Snowflake](https://ibb.co/vZ1v7yw) regain some momentum yesterday, rising by more than 13% despite the expiration period of another 38M shares. The latest IPOs and small-cap stocks have recently been able to raise a lot of capital as investors seem to be grabbing any share available at almost any price regarding valuations. This is a very dangerous thing yet again. This kind of stuff was happening in the last dot com bubble, though… I don’t really expect anything like that to happen with the overall stock market, but I think we might see some stocks have a big crash when valuations start to come back in the mind of investors.

Meanwhile we saw 2 big milestones for Tesla & Elon Musk yesterday as the company [passed](https://ibb.co/yXnFsbp) Facebook as market value goes as Tesla is seeing huge trading volumes as yesterday, it [traded](https://ibb.co/6BYkLP9) more shares than the next 3 big movers Apple, Alibaba and Amazon, while Elon Musk [became](https://ibb.co/xS0G5Sk) the richest man in the world, on the back of a 16% increase in Tesla stock already in 2021.

And two last pieces of good news are that the it’s expected the [FED](https://ibb.co/6FTNrSF) will likely hold rates near zero until 2024 while [Pfizer's](https://ibb.co/6nGSdWR) vaccine seems to be working as expected on multiple mutations, especially the latest highly transmissible one.

So, let’s hope for a good day as the European [markets](https://ibb.co/LdhPq9P) and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wSTgstr) are up to start off the day, with the Nasdaq Leading the way up over half a percent.

I don't have an issue with their business model of targeted advertising and selling data. They have to make money somehow and nobody is forcing you to join. My bigger concern and annoyance with this company is their constant need to get involved with political BS. Giving grants for election equipment, grants for ""fact checking"" organizations, and of course, recent censorship. This type of stuff drives away a significant chunk of your audience, which eventually means less revenue.

2021-01-20 12:36:21,It's time to short some Facebook $FB," Hey, 

Let's go straight to the point.

Apple announced in 2020 that they plan to increase the level of privacy of the iOS users, with the release of iOS 14. What does that mean concretely?

\--> As soon as you open a new app, they will ask with a pop up ""Do you allow this app to track you across different apps"". We expect that 10 to 20% of the users will say yes. Bumble officially said while filing their IPOs that could be a major risk for them, to do proper analytics on their users.

Therefore, all the apps relying on paid acquisition, won't be able to track where you are coming from, and if you are a rentable user. Therefore, it makes it even harder to create profitable user acquisition campaigns on mobile. Those who will suffer from it are casino, midcore, casual games, as well as all the apps relying on paid subscriptions. It will provoke a drop of eCPMS (price per 1000 impressions of ads), as there will be less demand on the ad networks.

Certain networks will suffer more than other, but the biggest one is Facebook.

99% of the revenue of Facebook is coming from ads. It means that they will still be able to do targeting on Facebook itself, but not on the networks of apps that run ads (like all the games). Facebook is a key player in this industry, and this will certainly provoke a drop in terms of revenue (9M businesses are relying on their ad network). They officially said that IDFA change (this iOS privacy update) "" Could Have A Material Business Impact"".

Apple postponed their measure to Q1 2021, but this will come.

Google usually follow suit with these kind of measures.

TLDR : Significant drop in terms of ad revenue on mobile due to the new iOS privacy change. It will prevent targeting and tracking of the users. Facebook will suffer from it like crazy, as well as other ad players such as Unity, Ironsource (IPO soon) or Applovin (IPO soon), and apps Bumble (IPO soon).

Play : Wait for Q4 Revenue of Facebook. Then short Facebook until next quarter, when the measure will show its impact

2020-12-22 13:38:22,Thoughts on FB stock price,"So, FB got hit by the antitrust lawsuit from FTC, but GOOGL also got hit by one but GOOGL has been up since the lawsuit was filed.

Politics aside, it does not appear likely that the courts will create precedent that the government can undo mergers long after they have been approved by the FTC and completed.  I know FTC has undone mergers before but most of those are either not vetted by FTC previously or were vetted but were undone shortly thereafter (within a year or two, not like 5-6 years in the case of FB and Instagram).

Analyst sentiment seems positive.  $350 price targets are common.  Biggest growth driver is as the primary System of Engagement for SMID sized businesses, which is something that few social media companies can rival (e.g. Pinterest and Etsy's audience are much more limited, which is not necessarily a bad thing but does mean those will not be used by say a local restaurant or contractor company, etc.).  In that regard, it benefits from reopening while also doing well if we get lockdowns again.  P/E seems low around 30 for a growth stock (most others like it have P/E around 35-40 at least).

2021-02-11 17:50:38,Blackberry -- A Dormant Giant,"###**Abbreviation Index:**

BB -- Blackberry

AWS -- Amazon Web Services

IVY -- Intelligent Vehicles Yo. I don't actually know if this stands for anything

QNX -- Quick-Unix perhaps? It's a Unix-like embedded microkernel RTOS (real-time operating system)

EOY -- end of year

PT -- price target

SP -- stock price

EV -- electric vehicle

SoC -- System on a Chip

IoT -- Internet of Things

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

**TL;DR:** Blackberry ($BB) is almost daily announcing new partnerships and new clients for their software, including new deals with companies that are just now or just this year launching autonomous vehicles that run on QNX software. The big kahuna of all these deals is BB's recent partnership with Amazon to go 50/50 into BB's software IVY, a scalable cloud-connected software platform designed for intelligent vehicle data gathering and data sharing. With Amazon's Jeff Bezos stepping down, and Andy Jassy filling his shoes, who was the CEO of AWS, BB will have some very firm support behind Amazon's new CEO. BB and Amazon are having a webinar Feb. 23rd about their partnership and IVY, which should be a strong catalyst moving forward. IVY beta earnings are projected to begin impacting BB's Q3 or Q4 earnings beginning in November this year, with IVY fully being integrated around the 2023 timeframe. Through a lot of reading and analysis, I believe BB has a four-tiered business model dating back as far as 2013 when BB's CEO John Chen was hired to begin the massive BB turnaround process. Tier 1 was development of QNX and IVY, lasting from 2013 to today and onward, however, Tier 2 overlaps Tier 1. Tier 2 was customer acquisition, primarily distributing their secure software in QNX, SecuSuite, Spark, and AtHoc. They secured 37 automakers during this time, including 9 of the top 10 automakers, over 106 governments from around the world, including all of G7 governments and 18 of G20 governments, as well as 77% of Fortune 100 companies, including partnerships with Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, NVIDIA, Intel, Qualcomm, Baidu, IBM, LG, Samsung, and others. Well if they have such an incredible market share, why are they so undervalued? The answer is that QNX was not the end-all-be-all product. It was the base that the rest would be built on. Particularly IVY, which is the real money-maker. Tier 3 is IVY beta, and Tier 4 is IVY distribution and subscription revenue streams. So why is IVY the big deal and not QNX? They are both big deals, but QNX was never designed to be the money-maker. They are charging a one-time fee per vehicle use. There is a bigger goal here, to secure their clients as their customers for the bigger product in IVY. They also need QNX is to be a secure system in order for IVY to be trustworthy and reliable. And it certainly is secure. QNX has ISO26262 certification, as well as US government clearance, NSA clearance, and CIA clearance. The US government uses QNX and Blackberry products. Just let that sink in. That should tell you something about its security. Anyways, IVY will be used in autonomous vehicle level 4 and level 5 communication (note that QNX is level 5 certified... it has a business moat just in its security level and clearance), as well as EV and gas vehicle data collecting and AI-powered data synthesis. See below for more details on IVY. Wrapping up this TL;DR, BB is going to do well this year as IVY unfolds, but will do even better in the next 2-5 years. I have a PT of 25 by EOY and a PT of 80 by 2023 EOY, and a PT of 160+ by 2025 EOY

**TL;DR: TL;DR:** BB go up, but go slow for now because IVY revenue not here yet, but big fast later. Make big monies, BB is the future tech that Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc will be building upon in the EV and IoT market

###**FAQs:**

**1) Why is Blackberry stock price going down?**

**A:** A few possible reasons. One, as of today the whole market is down. BB is connected to overall market swings as most companies are. Two, there may be some market manipulation by bearish financial institutions as there are a lot of calls expiring on 2/19. I would expect that BB SP to be volatile between $11 and $14 between now and then, and to move upwards after 2/19 and especially after 2/23 (Amazon + BB webinar). Three, there are bearish investors who still think BB is a phone company and don't understand the underworkings of BB's business strategy, their software, their patents, or their partners. Their revenue has been affected by coronavirus and has not been particularly phenomenal so far this year.

**2) Should I invest now or later?**

**A:** First off, I'm not a financial advisor, these are just my opinions. Invest at your own risk. In my opinion, BB will see a large SP growth by EOY, anywhere from 50% to 150% growth by EOY. While revenue will likely not increase much this year, the partnership with Amazon and news regarding IVY will likely create new floors for their SP much higher than the current SP right now, at around the $12 SP

**3) What's stopping competitors from building a similar product and hurting BB's business?**

**A:** There's a lot of reasons why BB has a huge moat right now. One, notice the partners that BB has with QNX. They've got all the big boys working them, aside from Apple and Tesla. Seeing as SpaceX runs on QNX, and seeing that Apple was trying to make a deal with Hyundai that did not go through, I think it is still possible that either Tesla or Apple or both companies could also make a deal with BB to use QNX as their OS system. BB worked to develop their QNX embedded microkernel OS for the last eight years or so. Anyone trying to step into the game now is far too late. Apple has the best chance of all companies, as it has its own OS and Apple knows security very well, but this still requires an entirely new system in order to work in the EV sector. Also, Apple announced recently that they would be developing their own EV, although they did not give much details beyond that statement. The likelihood that they are both working on the hardware and software side of this thing is slim given the large number of difficulties that come with certification as it relates to the cybersecurity software space. Regardless, I would suspect that either Apple or Tesla is the most likely to be competitors in this space, but neither company has successfully completed a certified OS system, particularly for the emerging sector of autonomous EVs. Tesla is currently building a Linux-based system that is having a lot of difficulty in passing certifications such as ISO26262, a struggle that has been ongoing for years now. They may achieve a product that passes these safety regulations and certifications, but the question remains whether this will be in time as the EV and autonomous market picks up speed, and whether competing companies would even be interested in using their product. In fact, any car company is unlikely to develop their own OS software because none of their competitors would be likely to use it. BB is the perfect business to license since it is not competing in the hardware sector for the EV market. This argument can also be used for Apple if they are also building an EV.

**4) Why is BB's revenue so low if they have so many customers and partners?**

**A:** QNX has been licensed so far as a one-time purchase, per vehicle or IoT using their software. IVY will be a subscription-based software that also includes a one-time purchase. Thus, BB's revenue streams are somewhat unimpressive currently, but they are playing the long game. If my hypothesis is correct, it is John Chen's goal to lay low as software is developed and customer relationships are built. It's the same with the book market. It's the sequel that makes all the money, not the first book. QNX is just the first book of a series looking to hook in its customers with low costs before hitting 'em with the strong follow up in IVY. Additionally, in order to build a competitive business moat, it was to their advantage to not forewarn any competitors of their involvement and plans. Consider John Chen's work as a CEO in his last business Sybase. Chen worked as the CEO of Sybase for 10 years. For the first 7 years, the SP remained at around $10 a share. Three years later, the SP was at $100 a share. I suspect he is implementing a similar model with Blackberry. Chen joined Blackberry in 2013. BB stock actually dropped for most of the last 7 years, resting at a stock price of around $5. Now BB is at $12 a share. I would not be surprised if BB reaches $50 two years from now.

#**Blackberry Analysis Regarding Infotainment and Google and Ford Deal:**

see ""Blackberry (BB) Stock News Analysis | What I need to say..."" by Financial Live by LEYA on the forbidden video website

--> The media recently picked out a story that left out a lot of pertinent information, making it seems that BB lost Ford as a client. This is not true. QNX is designed to be a SoC. This means that other operating systems, such as Linux or Android, can be easily added to QNX. It is in fact encouraged. The Ford and Google deal was simply announcing the Ford would be using Android as their infotainment system. I believe that BB was never intended to try and be the predominant entity for all software systems in EVs or IoTs, but the backbone that connects all together, and to protect all components in a secure system. Autonomous EVs and even regular EVs in general would not be possible without a secure system protecting the product, as is true with IoTs. This is also why things like US Fighter Jets run on... you guess it, QNX. Ford is still using QNX. It is simply also now using Android that is running on top of QNX

#**Facebook Settlement with BB**

[Image](https://imgur.com/GSmc5RH)

This is an interesting one to be sure. Facebook was being evil, like the do, and were caught using a number of BB patents. They settled in February, and the day that the settlement was finalized, John Chen (BB CEO) tweeted reminding everyone that BB is used on the ISS

https://twitter.com/JohnChen/status/1358853064153784321?s=20

Well, the connection and speculation here is that Blackberry is going to the moon, and that the settlement is rather significant. Someone else also dug out some information in Facebook's most recent 10-K, specifically a portion for a 'non-cancelable contractual commitment' of an amount of $7500 million dollars. That's 7.5 billion btw. We don't know how big the settlement is, but it is worth noting that BB's entire market cap is 7.5B. I highly doubt that a settlement would reach such lofty numbers, but it could be possible that FB settled for some initial amount of $1B or so, as well as $1B in reoccurring payments over several years. We won't know until March 15th actually, so stay tuned.

#**Blackberry New Partnerships**

Within the last few weeks, Blackberry has announced a stronger partnership with Baidu (China's Google), as well as their involvement with Baidu choosing to use QNX for their autonomous vehicles that will be hitting the road, as early as this year and next. BB has also announced their involvement with Motional, a joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv, which will use QNX for their autonomous vehicles. Motional will be partnering with Lyft to use autonomous vehicles to begin serving customers and will be deploying their vehicles in 2023. It was also announced that QNX will be working with AOSP (Android Open Source Project), as well as announcing yesterday that QNX Hypervisor 2.2 is now released, which is what allows Android and Linux to run on top of QNX.

This is the new wave of technology that will dominate the market. First we had the dot.com boom, then the cell-phone and smart-phone market, and now we have the autonomous EV and IoT market. If Amazon were to buy BB, they would have to submit a tender offer. This would be a red flag to all the big players that Amazon were trying to buy up the best security out there. It would be a bidding war that could result in a double-digit multi-billion dollar buyout. It was much more to their advantage to create a secret alliance with BB and establish a 50/50 partnership, whose contract includes exclusivity for their use of IVY. Ouch! That's gotta hurt. This is where the importance of QNX lies. BB will be able to pull the rug out from any company that chooses to use something other than IVY. No IVY, no QNX, no EV. It will be a package deal where IVY is the big money maker. All other companies will have to build from the ground up or be forced to license QNX and make their money off of other sectors, such as the infotainment sector, as Google has already begun to do with the Ford deal. When this deal happened, the other big boys wet their pants realizing they needed to get into this space, and fast. Microsoft partnered with Cruise/GM. Apple tried to partner with Hyundai, who was so flattered, they may have initially said yes or indicated so, before realizing that they were already partnered with BB, so it was a no-go. Not sure if that is fact or fiction, but it is an interesting proposal.

#**Blackberry IVY + AWS Partnership:**

Alright, so what's the deal with IVY? Why is it going to be so profitable? Why is IVY the real money-maker, while QNX has been used as the customer-acquisition software tool? Check out this picture:

[Image](https://imgur.com/P3mjahD)

For one, IVY is designed for real-time communication between EVs or other IoTs. Autonomous driving level 5 requires vehicles to communicate with one another. This is where IVY comes in. IVY connects the different software components of an EV (which presumably are running on QNX), as well as harvesting data on those systems. The data used can be distributed for a wide-variety of uses, including, but not limited to, automakers and suppliers, app developers, consumer services, smart cities, EV charging providers, insurance companies, and vehicle maintenance providers. All of these different sectors will be willing to pay subscriptions for these data services, as well as the automakers and IoT makers who will also be willing to pay subscriptions for IVY. For instance, IVY can help share information between vehicles that will allow for a car detecting ice roads in one area so that other cars using IVY can take a different route. This results in less crashes, which helps the automakers. Insurance companies can use data from all these different data points as well, allowing them an inside-view of their clients. The list of what is possible here is inexhaustible.

As for price points, the subscription models for multiple outside companies wanting to use the data will be create huge revenue streams for BB. With Amazon as a 50/50 partner, and with their resources and strategic management, BB will be poised to be the foundation in security and data sharing for the entire EV, and somewhat of the IoT market (the IoT market has more competitors for sure)

#**Revenue, revenue, revenue...**

Blackberry is poised to be an industry leader in EV, government, and IoT security and data sharing with products such as QNX, IVY, Spark, and their other software products. Stock price will likely stay somewhat stunted until IVY revenue begins picking up. It is possible that more announcements and marketing related to IVY will make this growth more rapid. In my opinion, either way BB over the next 5 years will 10x. The question is whether you want to get in now at $12 / share or two years from now at $40 a share or something similar, assuming that either way this stock is going to push for that 100B market cap (it's currently at 7B). There will be bearish analysts that will continue to say that Blackberry is a worthless company until those IVY revenue streams begin to come in. It is also possible that a realistic competitor may emerge within the next three years, such as Tesla or Apple. But if Apple is seeking to create its own EV product, then both companies will have a hard time finding any way to license their software to any other company. It remains possible that Apple and/or Tesla may strikes deals with BB as well in order to be able to produce autonomous vehicles and get a bite of that market share

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

#**Really, no competitors?**

Well it's called a business moat for a reason. As we have recently seen, QNX is working with AOSP, and so clearly, they are not to be worried about. Tesla is not a true competitor as their OS product is not certified yet, and has demonstrated difficulty in doing so, and additionally, other automakers will not want to benefit their competitors by using their product. A third-party non-auto-maker will be much more desirable. Other companies such as VxWorks, have a lot of to prove both in security and certifications, as well as producing an OS product that is compatible with an emerging autonomous level 5 EV market. QNX's embedded microkernel RTOS is very much unique in this regard. This type of system allows for real-time processing and power distribution, while protecting the system from attacks. In an embedded microkernel system, if one part of the system is attacked, the whole system will not shut down, in layman's terms. This is essential for the security of any high-risk product that is built upon an underlying software that controls that different components of the system.

#**Conclusion:**

All eyes are turned towards Blackberry right now. People want to know what this deal with Amazon will look like, how it will work, what they will focus on, (will Amazon also use this system for a fleet of delivery drones? hmmm), what the revenue streams will look like, what are their projections, what markets and sectors are they targeting, what are their future goals, what will Amazon be doing on their end, etc, etc. The Amazon + BB webinar may answer some of those questions, or maybe they won't. Time will tell (Feb. 23rd, specifically -- here's a link to sign up and watch: [Next-Gen Vehicle Architectures Unlock Unprecedented Opportunities for Automakers](https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&ShowUUID=44A51ADB-0425-420D-8A06-6ACABFCF98FF&LangLocaleID=1033&Referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.autonews.com%2Fevents%3Fevent_type%3D64571)). Also look out for that FB settlement numbers on March 15th, and Q4 earnings March 31st. I don't expect Q4 earnings to be particularly interesting unless they include the FB settlement numbers. Could those numbers instead be put into Q1 earnings for 2021? Possibly.

Initially IVY beta is expected to begin being released late this year. I will also be looking forward to see how Apple and Tesla respond in the coming months. Ultimately, BB is a long-term play, but is poised to dominate this emerging industry with the partnerships and security focused software they have secretly been building. Now if only the could do something about their logo, some rebranding would be nice...

2020-11-27 15:37:25,"How much of digital advertising is a bubble fueled by $GOOG, $FB, $AMZN?","The impetus for this question is a two-part Freakonomics podcast, ""Does Advertising Actually Work?"" In these episodes, the host discusses several flavors of advertising, including newspaper, TV and digital ads, the latter which has the largest implications for some of our highest performing companies over the past year. It's clear that this question is hard to answer - there is so much market inertia and business pressures hindering a thorough exploration of the topic, but nonetheless Stephen Dubner is able to present the case of eBay that showed that paid-search advertising has practically no impact on sales. 
Of course digital advertising is important for less mainstream companies who are trying to establish their brand, and micro-targeting consumers is very effective, but that accounts for a fraction of what is spent on these ads globally. Why are giants like Pepsi, Coca-Cola and Kroger still spending so much on ads for products that we all know, and how many hundreds of billions of dollars can they save if they were to conduct their own investigation only to find that these ads have almost no impact on sales? And how would the fallout from these studies affect the digital ad business, which is dominated by $GOOG, $FB, $AMZN in the U.S.?

2021-03-01 13:38:55,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, March 1 , 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, March 1, 2021**

Stocks staged a remarkable rally Monday as the market celebrated another effective coronavirus vaccine and Treasury yields stabilized. Each of the major indexes gained more than 2% today after suffering one of the worst weeks since October. 

The yield on the 10-year Treasury yield retreated to hover below 1.45% after spiking to a one-year high of 1.61% last week. The swift rise in interest rates last week spooked equity investors last week, with rates reflecting inflationary fears and impacting both corporate and consumer borrowing costs. Last week, during his testimony to Congress, Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell tried to temper fears over higher rates and inflationary pressures. He said,  rising Treasury yields are a statement of confidence on the part of markets that we’ll have a robust and ultimately complete \[economic\] recovery.” Central Bank officials from the United Kingdom and Australia echoed Powell’s sentiments and committed to maintaining accommodative fiscal policies. 

Over the weekend, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization to Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ) single-dose coronavirus vaccine, making it the third vaccine approved in the US.  [The company has already begun shipping its COVID-19 vaccine ](https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-u-s-cdc-advisory-committee-recommends-first-single-shot-covid-19-vaccine-for-adults-18-and-older-in-u-s)and expects to deliver more than 100 million doses of the single-shot vaccines during the first half of 2021, including more than 20 million by the end of March.

In Washington DC, over the weekend, the House of Representatives advanced the $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus package without any Republican support. The bill includes an additional payment of $1,400 to Americans, $400 per week in augmented Federal unemployment benefits, and $350 billion in State, local, and tribal aid. The bill now heads to the Senate, with lawmakers aiming to pass the bill before the mid-March deadline when current Federal unemployment benefits are set to expire. 

The Democrats are employing a process called reconciliation in order to get the stimulus bill passed without Republican support. Through reconciliation, Congress can enact legislation on taxes, spending, and the debt limit with only a majority (51 votes, or 50 if the vice president breaks a tie) in the Senate, avoiding the threat of a filibuster, which requires a 60 vote supermajority to overcome. As a reminder, there is a 50/50 split in the Senate, but Kamala Harris, as the Democratic Vice-President, has the power to break a tie.

2021-01-17 05:13:12,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How is ""Hype"" calculated?**

Well, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice

**2.4.2021 Prelude**:

If you are new to this DD, just continue on through below. If you have been keeping in touch, I mentioned this stock back in the $6 area and we managed to hit $28+ in such a short period of time. Lots and lots of firepower. To be frank, and many who have messaged me know, I started scaling out past 15 and closed out last Monday in the $20 area. Why? Because I wanted the stock to cool off and to let the market determine who really wanted to invest and own the stock, and who wanted it for the trade cause BRRRRR BB GO UP. Well, I’m back in, and here are my updates and reasons why. In addition, BB is decoupling from the GME trade, and should see much more lift comparatively.

**Intro**

Man Blackberry, who the hell thought I’d be investing in you after the fall of BBM and Brickbreaker. Well, strap in folks as I take you through one of the most bullish stories in stonk history, and it all starts with one statement. Everything you’re thinking about with Blackberry at the moment, is wrong.

It is not a phone company. It is not telling you to use BBM. It is a software, automotive, and cybersecurity company that is about to make a killing.

**Let’s begin**:

BB stock price, 6.71 as of Close on 1-6-2021. 
BB stock price, 9.84 as of Close on 1-18-2021. Only 9 days since I first posted. This is just the beginning.
BB stock price, 12 as of Close on 2-3-2021. Hit a high of 28.77 the week prior…this moved so fast.

**Technical 2.4.2021**

On the 4hr, volume is really cooling down lately and it seems to me that sellers are REALLY drying up. People that didn’t even want to part with their BB shares capitulated. Now we likely wash out yesterday’s nice move upwards before continuing to the upside. MACD cross/flip, Moving Averages basing, just looks overall quite nice.


**Recent Earnings**

Fiscal Quarter End| Date Reported| Earnings Per Share* | Consensus EPS* Forecast | % Surprise
---|---|----|----|----
Nov 2020	| 12/17/2020	| 0	| -0.04	| 100
Aug 2020	| 09/24/2020	| 0.1	| -0.02	| 600
May 2020	| 06/24/2020	| 0	| -0.04	| 100
Feb 2020	| 03/31/2020	| 0.06	|0.01	|500

Surprises along the board.

Revenues Q3, $224 MM.

Revenues projected for Q4, $246 MM. This will be beaten immensely.

Full year Guidance 2021, $950 MM. 

Mkt cap, $4 B. 

Total company non-GAAP revenue of $224 million; total company GAAP revenue of $218 million. Non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.02; GAAP loss per basic and diluted share of $0.23. Net cash generated from operating activities of $29 million.


**NEWS EVENTS**

FB settlement

BB won a suit against Zuckerberg $FB related to messaging, whatsapp, and whatnot. This settlement has now occurred. Check Bloomberg for the deets

Someone I know and trust let me know that there are rumors that the settlement is worth $2B and a 2 year partnership. This is not fact, just rumor, but if it is true that is MASSIVE.

BlackBerry IVY – Intellectual Vehicle Data Platform

The big kahuna that will change BB for the next few years. Per BB website: “BlackBerry and AWS are joining forces to develop BlackBerry IVY, a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology.”

What does it mean to the end consumer (the automakers)

**IVY Fueling Business Outcomes**

BlackBerry IVY will help automakers and automotive suppliers:

* Fuel Innovation by supporting rapid development of new customer experiences
* Drive Revenue by unlocking new revenue streams and business models
* Reduce Costs by moving processing to the edge & reducing raw data transmission
* Improve Operations with enhanced data visibility and access
* Expand Ecosystems by unlocking the broader app developer community

The IVY deal has so much commercial promise. Manufacturers are going to buy IVY because of the data gathering, but more importantly IVY is going to become the universal app store for automotive apps. The IVY platform will be universal across manufacturers and models so a developer can build an app that will work on any car that has IVY. BB will take an app store like commission on revenue. Billions.

After cars, IVY and QNX will move to the broader Internet of Things. Planes, trains, medical devices, EVERYTHING will be connected and needs to be secure. BB has competitive advantages over all the other players, especially Linux because it is not secure, while BB’s QNX has the highest achievable safety certs.

If the automotive biz wasn’t enough they have interesting offerings in corporate data security, anti-virus, and emergency notification systems. They are literally in some of the hottest spaces you could be right now, with no signs of cooling.
As of their conferences, IVY and QNX both seem to be opening up many many more avenues of revenue to tackle within the auto space. Per Steve Rai, what was typically 2-3 avenues of revenue is not 5-6, with IVY being a HUGE 7th.

**Partnerships with big companies**

Blackberry partnered with Zoom (link: https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/10/blackberry-and-zoom-together-secure-your-virtual-enterprise-meetings), Microsoft Teams (link: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-athoc-integrates-with-microsoft-teams-for-critical-event-management-301147559.html) and ServiceNow. BB’s Incident Management Response System AtHoc is integrating into the NOW platform. Cybersecurity adding onto big big platforms that exploded this past year. MORE MONEY. I think this should pull above $10 MM per month, $120MM a year? Sounds enticing to me when we are at $~1B revenue with a 76% gross margin.

Sony announced a BlackBerry partnership, per CEO @JohnChen on Twitter: Thank you for your partnership @Sony. You are an icon and I look forward to experiencing your #ElectricVehicle embedded with @BlackBerry software. But first, where I can get a #Playstation5? #EV#PS5

BB & BAIDU announced their partnership too!

**Patents**

BB Selling Smartphone Patents to Huawei, more $$$$ coming in. Recent Sale news here: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-blackberry-sells-90-patents-to-huawei-covering-key-smartphone/?cmpid=rss&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter

BB JUST won a suit against Facebook for one of the patents they hold: https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/blackberry-and-facebook-are-in-process-of-global-settlement. This is minimum likely worth $500 MM+, but to my knowledge off of some juicy rumors, this is a $2B settlement with FB and a 2 year partnership. MASSIVE.

**Business Implications**

BB makes their money from licensing, cybersecurity (one of the only companies that have not been hacked in this SolarWind shit), BB QNX is already in 175 MM cars worldwide, partnered with XPEV, and is in talks with multiple Tier 1 automakers, 20 different OEMs, and will be in vehicles by 2023. Does that mean anything now? Yes, you dumbass. Per CEO John Chen, my new president, #DidYouKnow @BlackBerry has been selected by 19 of the top 25 #ElectricVehicle manufacturers, and they represent 61% of the Electric Vehicle market?

Bubblicious and sexy. Expect some of the big tier 1s like Nissan, Toyota, BMW, and others to jump on this train. Think TSLA doesn’t have competition? They cant even make a billion dollars unless they sell stock.

Here is the biggest catch: Right now the auto industry is actually selling less cars, and many of the EVs that BB is partnered with are really in the liftoff phase. When XPEV (my favorite EV and I am working on my print for them as we speak), NIO, BIDU, Hyundai, get their EV and Self Driving Cars off the ground and start growing their vehicle output, this number will grow and grow. BB is really at the brink of an explosive couple of years. You are entering at the ground floor.

**CONFERENCES**  

BB has just spoken at the following conferences:
Citi’s 2021 Global TMT West Virtual Conference with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) 

JP Morgan 19th Annual Tech / Auto Forum with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) 

Needham’s 23rd Annual Virtual Growth Conference with Ryan Permeh, Blackberry Chief Security Architect & Co-founder of Cylance and Eric Cornelius, Blackberry Chief Product Architect.

Upcoming conference on Feb 22nd, 2 PM EST with **AMZN** and **BB**. Will update with a link when I get the chance

**Conclusion**:

This stock will generate a lot more cash in the coming years, will gain in the short term by offloading old patents, settling with FB and getting some moolah, growing in their partnership with Bezos gang, roll out to more EVs with Tier 1 and Tier 2 automotive companies, and compete with Tesla on this as well. ~~This trades at $6.70.~~ They already are used by big companies for Access and other Mobile apps, so that someone can securely use their dinky iPhone to work. Think big whales aren’t interested? Look at 2022 2023 option OI. 

From here, 12.5 leads to 15, 28, and probably some wild momentum to 40-50. More shorts have entered, likely more institutions have entered long. It is an exciting time for Blackberry, let’s roll

2021-03-11 13:20:09,$BB Technical Analysis,"Hi guys, your daily pumper here.  


It's looking like the downtrend is over and we are in the recovery phase. It has been a long 6 week downtrend but I'm happy we stopped out at \~9 USD and have a green week. We got above $10 nicely and now it's \~$11 we are fighting for. A lot of open interest at $11 so I am hopeful that those who have the cash to buy stock will pump it up so tomorrow's contracts may be in the money. I think we can secure $11 tomorrow, today we are up over 3% on the LOWEST volume day we've had in 2 months. Crazy. People are buying and holding. I like that. That being said I would not be shocked to see it red tomorrow and retest $10. RSI is close to overbought on the hourly but the Bollinger bands are VERY tight. Might be a signal to break out. Hard to say what happens tomorrow.   


Why is $14.44 significant?  
Thats where the dead-cat/falling knife bounce happened. A lot of shares were purchased/sold at that time and it acted as resistance shortly after, and again a few days later. If \~14.44 is secured, and if we retrace and it acts as support, then the bull trend will continue. If not then we might be in trouble and could be a false rally. 

I don't believe this will happen, there's a lot of eyes on BB and their upcoming financials and the latest news about BB working with AWS cloud infrastructure in the government in my opinion is a license to print money, and institutions wanna know how much money BB received from Huwaei and FB.  
RSI on the daily and 4-hour charts are looking healthy.   
I'd like the Bollinger bands to contract a bit more but hey, that's fine with me if it holds the smaller upwards trendline.

Cybersecurity is a major threat and only gets worse as days go on, BB is best in class in this aspect.

Keep holding my friends, you're in a great position if you bought or averaged down in the last week.  
Take care.",167,0.86
2020-07-30 13:32:16,AMZN & FB 🚀,"Congrats to all who's owning those

2020-12-24 11:35:36,"My $112,000 climate change portfolio at the age of 19 & what I've learned","First of all, I am incredibly privileged. When my grandpa passed away in March, I inherited $30,000. I had $10,000 saved up as well from working the prior summer and that $10,000 was already invested in the stock market. In high school I found out about stocks in my economics class and the day I turned 18 I invested every penny I had. 

Once again, I am privileged to be able to invest this money at all.. I have a college fund to pay my tuition, I don’t have to worry about when my next meal is coming, and I have the freedom to spend my money as I choose. 

Anyways, in March & April when the market crashed I decided it was time to really dive into the stock market. I spent about 5 hours every day researching companies and I’m here to share what I’ve learned. 

In my opinion, **the** **companies** **you** **invest** **in** **should** **be** **an** **extension** **of** **your** **worldview.** Where do you think the world will be in 10 years+ and what industries will prosper from the change. As I was raised in a liberal family and hold these values, I’m quite concerned with **Climate** **Change**. I’ve taken college classes in this realm since and learned more about the risks we face. I believe that any company whose mission revolves around mitigating the climate crisis will prosper in the coming decades. 

------------------------------------

That being said, I’ll list the companies I hold and a very brief synopsis of what they do and why I hold their stock. **Please** **do** **your** **own** **research**; this is only meant to introduce young investors to a certain mindset that I hold and the companies that I choose to support. 

--------------------------

1) **Tesla** **(TSLA)** 

portfolio weight: **22.86%**

gain/loss **1026%** **gain**

You guys all know what Tesla is about. They are the premier EV company with goals of cutting battery costs by 56% and producing 20,000,000+ cars in the decade. They also have a growing energy business with solar roofs, panels, battery storage and an autobidder software. Tesla is priced insanely high by traditional metrics. If these metrics are your investing style then it’s not for you. If you’re like me, and you look for companies to hold for decades then I believe Tesla is one of the best investments out there. What other company will benefit from the transition to renewables in response to climate change and changing political conditions?

----------------------------------

2) **MP** **Materials** **(MP)**

portfolio weight: **12.68%**

gain/loss: **197%**  **gain**

MP is the only active rare earth mineral miner in the U.S. They produce neodymium concentrates which are important components in NDPR magnets; used in EV motors, wind turbines, electronics & much more. 

I bought MP during their early pre-merger days and have already seen considerable profits in a few months. I’ve been shaving this position to keep it around 10% because it is a commodity play which can be quite risky. That being said, rare earths are expected to appreciate substantially in price as EV demand increases. Furthermore, MP is moving downstream to refine their rare earths themselves, as they currently ship them to China to be refined, and in the future they plan on manufacturing their own NDPR batteries. This will increase their margins greatly. 

----------------------------------

3) **Planet** **13** **(PLNHF)**

portfolio weight **5.35%**

gain/loss: **147.71%** **gain**

This one is a MJ stock and I’m focusing mostly on my Climate Change investments on this post so I’ll keep it brief. They own a superstore in Vegas and have their own brands. I believe the MJ industry is going to explode soon and PLNHF will benefit. 

--------------------------------------

4) **Jinko** **Solar** **(JKS)**

portfolio weight: **4.91%**

gain/loss: **268.88%** **gain**

Jinko Solar is a leading solar panel manufacturer in China. They’ve seen market consolidation in China and are poised to benefit from increasing demand and incentives around solar energy. Specifically, South East Asia is expected to see dramatic growth in renewables as China/India are responsible for a large portion of global emissions and are also seeing considerable growth in GDP and population. It’s a play on the South East Asian economy and renewable industry. 

-------------------------------------

5) **SolarEdge** **(SEDG)**:

portfolio weight: **4.89%**

gain/loss: **108.5%** **gain**

SolarEdge is the global leader in panel inverters, which turn the sun’s D.C. current into usable electricity for households (A.C. current). The inverter space is a much more consolidated industry with higher margins than panels. They trade at a more expensive multiple and are expected to see dramatic top and bottom line growth in the coming years. Solar panels need inverters to perform; simple as that. With fewer companies focused on this space, I expect the top players to have a large market share and grow along with the solar energy market. SEDG is also expanding into the energy storage and EV charging markets with recent acquisitions. 

--------------------------------------

6) **Enphase** **Energy** **(ENPH)**

portfolio weight: **4.43%** 

gain/loss: **203.08%** **gain**

Enphase is also in the inverter market, with their differentiated microinverters. Micro Inverters are generally used in smaller systems and optimal for residential solar. Everything said above about the inverter market is true for Enphase as well. Enphase’s business goes beyond inverters though. They are targeting a full residential energy ecosystem, with storage and their “Enlighten” software App, which will manage home energy usage and sell excess energy back to the grid. Enphase is very much a play on a future decentralized microgrid, with homes trading energy to each other as prices fluctuate. 

-------------------------------------------

7) **Canadian** **Solar** **(CSIQ)**

portfolio weight: **4.42%**

gain/loss: **118.32%** **gain**

Canadian Solar is another panel manufacturing company. They are also seeing growth in market share as smaller players struggle during the pandemic. CSIQ is a low cost producer with residential, commercial and grid level projects. They are planning on expanding their recurring revenue stream through full and partial ownership of solar projects. You can read more about this on the IR page. CSIQ is a pure solar play with an international footprint and vast management expertise. They will certainly benefit from any movement towards renewables, especially if legislation is passed to set a price on carbon. 

--------------------------

8) **Lemonade** **(LMND)** 

portfolio weight: **3.93%**

gain/loss: **112.52** **gain**

Lemonade is not a climate change related investment. It’s highly speculative but I think their management team and business model is really cool so I put some money in (and quickly more than doubled it). I’ll be brief here, but basically they are a home/renter/pet insurance company that takes a flat 25% cut of premiums as revenue and uses the remaining money to pay out claims. They aim to align incentives by donating anything left over beyond the 25% to a charity of customers choosing. Also, their use of AI makes the registration and claims process seamless and “delights” customers. 

----------------------------

9) **TPI** **Composites** **(TPIC)**

portfolio weight: **3.73%**

gain/loss: **153.99%** **gain**

TPIC manufacturers wind blade composites. They supply the top five wind turbine companies outside of China. I wrote about them on prior posts so I’ll just copy & paste here:
63% of total wind blade manufacturing is outsourced to companies like TPI and they are the market leader in this space with about 20% market share globally. The business currently has low margins, but they target a 12% EBITDA margin for the future, and they trade at a measly 0.74 P/S ratio currently. They are also expanding into EV composite manufacturing and have a contract with Workhorse to manufacture vehicle parts for them.
-----------------------------

10) **Skyworks** **Solutions** **(SWKS)**

portfolio weight: **2.83%**

gain/loss: **60.57%** **gain**

Skyworks is a semiconductor focused on connectivity chips for all kinds of devices. They aren’t climate change related which is the point of this post so I’ll leave it at that.

----------------------------

11) **Tattooed** **Chef** **(TTCF)**

portfolio weight: **2.65%**

gain/loss: **55.90%** **gain**

Tattooed Chef is a play on the rising plant-based food trend. They make a variety of frozen food items, widely available in Walmart, Costco and Target. They are expanding into Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s and many more stores, where I expect them to be very successful. The plant based market is exploding for a couple of reasons. Firstly, there is more research on the health benefits of a plant based diet, with athletes such as Chris Paul & Todd Gurley endorsing these brands. Also, consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the threat of climate change and how avoiding red meat can have a positive impact on the planet. I expect TTCF to benefit off of these trends and continue innovating in the plant-based space. I bought in 3 weeks ago and the price has exploded since then. 

-------------------------

12) **Workhorse** **(WKHS)**

portfolio weight: **2.60%**

gain/loss: **35.90%** **gain**

Workhorse is an electric delivery van company. They manufacture last mile electric vehicles and are developing drones to further decrease last mile delivery costs. They are a play on the e-commerce industry and electrification of vehicles. I’m invested in them because last mile delivery is responsible for a large chunk of transportation carbon emissions and in desperate need of electrification. I also believe that Workhorse will get a large chunk of the upcoming USPS contract which will provide a stable revenue stream.

---------------------

13) **Aphria** **(APHA)**

portfolio weight: **2.45%**

gain/loss: **53%** **gain**

Aphria is another MJ play for me. Once again they aren’t a climate change investment so I’ll keep it brief. They just finalized a merger with Tilray, making them the biggest cannabis producer in the world. They are based in Canada and I believe they will be the market leader in Europe, due to their infrastructure advantage through owning CC Pharma.

----------------------------

14) **Vestas** **Wind** **Systems** **(VWDRY)**

portfolio weight: **2.40%**

gain/loss: **197.44%** **gain**

Vestas is the global leader in wind turbine manufacturing and installation. They are one of the few pure wind plays in the stock market, making them an attractive choice for anybody looking to get exposure to wind. A big driver if future growth will be their service and maintainace business, which their management team has been focused on in recent quarters. This is a higher margin business with consistent recurring revenues. 

----------------------------

15) **Facebook** **(FB)**

portfolio weight: **2.38%**

gain/loss: **20.61%** **gain**

I’m selling out of FB very soon but I still hold them for now. FB is an incredible business and I’m sure they’ll see growth in the future, but it just isn’t for me (anymore). I consider ethics a lot in my investments, which many of you may consider stupid but idc. 

---------------------------

16) **Hannon** **Armstrong** **(HASI)**

portfolio weight: **2.18%**

gain/loss: **57.40%** **gain**

HASI is a REIT, which solely makes climate change related investments. They invest in the land under solar projects, energy efficient buildings and much more. HASI is a great dividend play and I expect their stock price to appreciate as climate change worries are exacerbated in the future. 

---------------------------

17) **Beyond** **Meat** **(BYND)**

portfolio weight: **2.10%**

gain/loss: **21.24%** **gain**

I made a post with some DD earlier this year on Beyond so I’ll just link that below:

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/if9tmj/beyond_meat_bynd_fundamental_analysis_with_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

---------------------------

18) **Brookefield** **Renewable** **Partners** **(BEPC)**

portfolio weight: **2.06%**

gain/loss: **87.23%** **gain**

BEPC owns and operates a portfolio of renewable energy assets. Earlier this year they completed a merger with Terraform Power, expanding their solar & wind footprint. They are also the primer owner of hydroelectric power plants, which produce a consistent source of electricity. BEPC has a strong management team and owns valuable assets that will greatly appreciate in value as government incentives expand around renewable energy consumption. They also pay a nice dividend. 

--------------------------


19) **Disney** **(DIS)**

portfolio weight: **2.03%**

gain/loss: **50.06%** **gain** 

I’m invested in Disney mostly for some portfolio diversity. I’m a big fan of their streaming platform and business strategy revolving around that. This one isn’t climate change related so I’ll leave it at that.

--------------------------


20) **First** **Solar** **(FSLR)**

portfolio weight: **1.84%**

gain/loss: **70.47%** **gain**

First Solar is an American based panel manufacturer and projects operator. They used differentiated technology with Cadmoum Telluride panels, which are supposed to increase output and lifetime at a higher cost. FSLR is just another play on the growing solar industry, and being U.S. based seems to reward them a higher earnings multiple in the market than their peers. They also have a beautiful balance sheet. 

--------------------------


21) **Trulieve** **Cannabis** **(TCNFF)**

portfolio weight: **1.44%**

gain/loss: **5.33%** **gain**

Trulieve is another Cannabis play. This one based in the U.S. with a large medical market in Florida. Nuff said. (Do your own research) 

--------------------------

22) **Star** **Peak** **Energy** **Transition** **(STPK)**

portfolio weight **1.43%**

gain/loss: **55.45%** **gain**

Star peak is a brand new holding for me and already shot up like crazy. It’s one of these merger companies (the word is censored on this subreddit). merging with Stem energy storage. Stem is involved in the battery storage industry, with mostly grid level storage systems. They currently have an even larger market share than Tesla and my reason for holding this stock is mostly as a hedge against Tesla’s energy business. 

--------------------------


23) **Shopify** **(SHOP)**

portfolio weight: **1.10%**

gain/loss: **18.19%** **gain**

Shopify is an eCommerce platform, which allows customers to seamlessly design their own website and process payments. I’ve used Shopify in the past and am a big fan of the business, which is a big part of why I’m invested. They have a steep valuation but I plan on holding for 10+ years. 

--------------------------

Total gain: **181.52%**

(Note: I’ve taken some profits on a few of my stocks so the unrealized gain from my current holdings is less than my “total” gain by a few % points.)

--------------------------

Yes, I’m young and idealistic and have a lot to learn but I do know a few things. Here’s some of the lessons I’ve learned along my 1 and a half year journey in the market. 

--------------------------

1. By investing in a company, you are supporting them financially. Buying pressure on companies’ stocks increases the price and allows them to raise capital more efficiently. It might be hard to hear, but **when** **you** **buy** **Exxon** **stock**, **you** **are** **helping** **them** **destroy** **our** **planet**. The same is true vice versa.  

2. **Don’t** **listen** **to** **anybody** **on** **reddit**. Seriously. Nobody here knows any better than you. Do your own research, form your own judgements. If you’re gonna pick individual stocks then following advice on reddit is not the way to go. Reading through investor relations pages is the best way to go. Watch videos and read articles about both sides of the story with different companies. Don’t take these videos as facts though, just absorb what other people think and judge the validity of the information for yourself. It’s important to **become** **an** **independent** **thinker**. This is a slow process but eventually you’ll get the hang of things.

3. **Invest** **with** **a** **10+** **year** **timeline**. This is especially true if you’re young like myself. Don’t concern yourself with daily or even monthly swings in a stock. Ask yourself if the company will be worth substantially more in a decade. If not, then say, if so then buy and hold. Don’t try to time the market or swing trade. You’re just bringing on unnecessary risk. Buy and hold and buy some more. 

4. **Assess** **your** **own** **risk** **tolerance**. As I’m sure several people will point out, my portfolio is incredibly speculative and risky from a traditional viewpoint. I have a really fucking high risk tolerance, so I invest with a “riskier” mindset. If I were to lose all my money tomorrow, I’d be fine. I’m going to have a college degree in a couple years and I’m not worried about being able to find a job. My reason for investing is about having the financial freedom to do whatever I want in life, and not worry about money in the future. If you’re investing for retirement or to pay off student loans, then I recommend taking a more conservative approach and maybe buying some index funds. However, if you’re young and have a stomach for risk like myself, then go crazy.

------------------------------------

In conclusion, I’ve had an incredible year or so in the market. I don’t expect to have even close to these same returns in the future, but I’ve learned a thing or two and I’m here to share this information. You may disagree with everything I said and all the stocks I own and that’s okay! Don’t copy my portfolio and take everything I say with a grain of salt, however I hope you find some wisdom from this post!


-------------------------

**Edit:** Since a bunch of people pointed out angrily in the comments that holding FB, DIS, SHOP and MJ stocks don't really align with ""your investments should be an extension of your worldview,"" I agree with you guys. There are some notable exceptions, and not everything that us as humans do in our everyday lives align with our values. This is true of my portfolio too, however about 80% of the investments are climate change related, 10% weed (which I like) and the other 10% tech. If 90% of your actions in life further your world view then you're doing pretty damn good IMO

**Edit2**: Also people seem to be pissed bc I inherited a lot of the money (3/4 of it) that I invested. I acknowledged already that I'm very lucky to be in this position and I don't really know what else to say about that, other than I aim to do something good with the money that I make",4200,0.77
2021-03-05 08:16:19,"Begun, the Mortgage Wars have","Yesterday Matt Ishbia, CEO of United Wholesale Mortgage ($UWMC), declared war on his main competitors Rocket Mortgage ($RKT) and Fairway Independent Mortgage (not publicly traded) in a company update done on Facebook Live. Watch here: https://fb.watch/423ZojMyjC/

Wholesale lending to consumers through a network of independent mortgage brokers is UWMC and FIM entire business and makes up about 25% of RKT's. 

Ishbia said UWMC will no longer work with mortgage brokers that work with either RKT or FIM claiming that the other two companies use slimy tactics that hurt mortgage brokers. They are requiring that every mortgage broker sign an addendum by March 15 agreeing to not work with RKT or FIM.

UWMC said that they had heard from about 580 mortgage brokers by last evening and that 550 had signed the addendum (there are an estimated 40,000 brokers in the US according to the Association of Independent Mortgage Experts)

This will be a disaster for someone. If UWMC can successfully prevent brokers from working with anyone but them, it will destroy FIM and put a big hole in RKT's income statement. If it doesn't work and brokers continue to work with RKT and FIM, UWMC will fall apart unless they backtrack on their ultimatum.",93,0.95

2021-02-22 13:42:04,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, February 22, 2021. Please enjoy!"," 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, February 22, 2021**

Stocks finished mixed as rising Treasury yields and expectations of higher inflation weighed on equity prices. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed the day modestly green while the S&P 500 (SPY) and the Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back steeply. The tech-heavy Nasdaq posted its worst performance in more than a month.

Prospects of rising inflation following the coronavirus pandemic have pushed bond prices lower while pushing Treasury yields sharply higher. .The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note briefly ticked above 1.39% on Monday to reach a fresh one-year high. Higher Treasury yields lead banks to place higher on loans in order to offset the effect of inflation. With so much money being pumped into the economy this year, many analysts have warned about rising inflation rates in the post-pandemic economy. However, despite the abrupt spike, Treasury yields remain at historically low levels. Now is not the time to panic, several fundamental factors, such as favorable fiscal and monetary policy and growing corporate earnings, remain in place to support a post-pandemic bull market. Below is a chart of the 10-year Treasury Yield rate made by Bloomberg📷

The COVID-19 vaccine rollout in the U.S. has so far seen just under 64.2 million doses administered to Americans as of Monday morning, according to an update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Additionally, 75.3 million doses have so far been delivered to states, inclusive of both Moderna's and Pfizer's and BioNTech's vaccines. Last week, the United States averaged 77,665 new coronavirus cases per day, a drop of 43% from the average of two weeks ago according to data analyzed by the New York Times. The drop in cases is staggering given that on January 8, the US recorded more than 300,000 new cases. 

**Highlights**

* A lot of popular EV stocks like Tesla (TSLA), Nio (NIO), Plug Power (PLUG) and many others have been pulling back sharply in recent days. Remember Psychos, many of these stocks were overvalued 1-2 weeks ago, pullbacks like this represent an opportunity.
* After reaching an impressive high of $58,000, Bitcoin (BTC) pulled back around 10% today.
* The dollar slid against major currencies, slumping to multi-year lows against the British pound and the Australian dollar, another sign of rising fears of inflation
* Australia will not alter legislation that would make Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google pay news outlets for content, a senior lawmaker said on Monday, as Canberra neared a final vote on whether to pass the bill into law. Remember, as of now, Facebook (FB) is not showing any news to its users in Australia.
* China’s bank regulator on Saturday tightened requirements on the internet loan business of commercial banks, amid heightened scrutiny of online lending by internet giants such as Ant Group, the finance arm of Alibaba Group.
* Albermarle (ALB) target raised by Argus from $140 to $177 at Buy. Stock currently around $156. We like this stock, one of the largest publicly traded lithium miners.
* Baidu (BIDU) target raised by Barclays from $350 to $400 at Overweight. Stock currently around $340
* Crowdstrike (CRWD) target raised by JMP Securities from $180 to $295 at Outperform. Stock currently around $240
* Evolus (EOLS) target raised by Cantor Fitzgerald from $11 to $20 at Overweight.
* EPAM Systems (EPAM) target raised by Barclays from $377 to $450 at Overweight. Stock currently around $376
* Overstock (OSTK) target raised by Needham & Co. from $98 to $110 at Buy. Stock currently around $101. 
* Pure Storage (PSTG) target raised by JMP Securities from $26 to $35 at Outperform. Stock currently around $27
* United Therapeutics (UTHR) target raised by Credit Suisse from $169 to $196 at Outperform. Stock currently around $175
* Zscaler (ZS) target raised by Royal Bank of Canada from $205 to $240 at Outperform. Stock currently around $226

2021-01-31 04:32:17,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. I've displayed the most 'popular' tickers on whichever sub-reddit the post may have originated from. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

2021-03-15 18:58:48,Advice on what to add to my portfolio needed 💵,"Hello looking for some advice on some stocks to add positions to in the coming weeks/months. I have about 50K of cash ready to deploy at appropriate moments, not all of it at once necessarily, but looking for good entry points, primarily in tech and growth sectors. All these positions will be long holds at minimum 5 years ideally 10-15 for most. I am 24 years old I have a fairly well diversified portfolio that I have been growing and building for a little less than a decade; holdings are listed below. I have a medium - high risk tolerance for this final chunk of cash to deploy. I'm planning to potentially increase my positions in PLTR, FB, DOCU PYPL and DIS and maybe a few others but as I said I'm also looking for some names to add that aren't on this list. I'd like to find a few names that have lots of room for potential growth even if they are on the risky side but high potential payouts. I have a well balanced portfolio with a large percentage of my assets in ETF's and low risk assets so I'm looking for a few more speculative, aggressive plays to make, any and all advice is welcome; as well as comments/critiques on my current holdings.

2021-02-27 11:01:07,A Warning About ARK Funds,"Before you downvote: I dont hold a long or short position in any ARK fund or their holdings

This week has been a bad week for tech and growth stock investors in general. The Ark funds have been hit hard and faced some liquidations. Cathie publicly told everyone her plan if faced with liquidations, she planned to sell the megacap stocks so she wouldn't have to touch her illiquid small caps.

Well thats exactly what the ARK funds did this week. As of today ARKK no longer holds any FB, AMZN, AAPL, TSM and BABA. She sold all of it this week and bought more small caps and TSLA. Now ARK is is a very precarious situation. Their biggest stocks are now TSLA, PYPL, SHOP and SQ. If the sell off continues and ARK will be forced to sell these stocks or sell their illiquid small caps.

A lot of people have taken note of this, including hedge funds which may enter predatory shorts if they think ARK is vulnerable. The next couple of weeks is crucial for ARK, should the market go back up they will look like geniuses, but should it go down...they will be in a world of pain.

If ARK is forced to sell the small caps which are illiquid, it will crash the prices and crater ARK's NAV. This will add to the bad performance and may accelerate redemptions creating a death spiral.

EDIT: I was wrong about TSM. They still have .5% TSM",0,0.49

Then I think of SNAP but they just don’t seem to be making much progress with their technology and leaving a lot of potential innovation on the table. This leaves me with $PINS. Seeing that Cathie Wood added $PINS to ARK peaked my interest and looking at their massive earnings this past quarter leaves me thinking Pinterest has the biggest growth potential out of all the “social-media” stocks... Looking for a straight-forward discussion here for any potential longs, what are your thoughts on Pinterest (PINS) and how do you think they’ll continue to grow/innovate in the coming years?",10,0.83
2021-02-26 04:59:10,Friday 26 February 2021: A discount bot I have created.,"Friday 26 February 2021

*Live Updates*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Background:**

* My discount bot to help Reddit. It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.
* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.
* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.
* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.
* There are a lot of SPY500/""boomer"" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.
* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.
* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement
* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only
* This is a one man bot.

**Bot Overview**:

It's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits. Backtesting has not been done, do not YOLO your life savings into whatever stated risking it all.  Rather use this as a side tool.

**Key:**

* Penny stocks are very risky.
* Pharma companies are very risky.
* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.
* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.
* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).
* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.
* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.
* Take the ""Calls"" as very discounted, and ""Potentially A Call"" as somewhat discounted.
* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.
* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.
* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.

2021-03-10 23:30:22,Short Term Investing Advice,"I’ll try and keep this as short as possible with a little background since it’s a specific circumstance. My Mom is a Financial Advisor of 25+ years and has raised me to invest, buy and hold, diversify, etc. She doesn’t buy individual stocks and only invests in Mutual Funds and ETF’s mostly because my Mom and Dad’s age (65/60) and risk level. I always had her put me in Science and Technology and it’s done very well to say the least. I am generally knowledgeable of the market and understand the risks involved.

I am now 26 and working from home. I work in Sales for a TV sports network and make $80,000/yr. I have a stable income. I am obviously much riskier than my Mom and currently have $54,000 in shares of extremely high risk,  volatile stocks (TTD, AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, ABNB, FSLY, PINS, FB, PYPL, SE, SHOP, SQ, MELI, DDOG, ARKK) and around 25 more tech, e-commerce, and infrastructure stocks. The problem is I had saved $30,000 the past year and bought a lot of tech last Monday. Needless to say it got bumpy and my Mom offered me a deal when my account got to $48,000 (16% in 2 days):

Now for the StoNKs advice:

DEAL: Guaranteed my $61,000 original investment if I do not invest any more money this year and simply hold investments of some kind until the end of the year. IF they are above $61,000 at the end of the year, we will split any profits 50/50. 

I am looking to buy a house the beginning of next year so this is around a 6-9 month window. What stocks would you invest in for the remainder of 2021? Would you be extremely risky and tech heavy since that money is guaranteed anyways?

EDIT 1: All financial advice will be considered and evaluated, definitely no guarantees, but my thought process is, if the money is technically guaranteed then I should be in tech/growth for the risk/reward. My Mom agrees with the tech part in Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, but is weary of the growth stocks that ran in 2020 for valid reasons.",7,0.82
2021-03-13 17:54:06,Very bullish on SNAP,"Guys. I absolutely love snap stock. Idk why I only make theses posts when I’m umm.. pharmaceuticaly influenced. But please I NEED HELP
Please if you are bearish about snap. Let me know. I’m planning on buying a few call options on them. 

Snap ipo’d in 2017 and just broke even from their overpriced ipo late 2020. 

Their company isn’t as privacy invasive as FB and I can genuinely see them taking them down one day. Maybe in 5 years. 

As of rn. The best social media business. Is FB. And I see why. They literally stalk u ebeywhere. Location, web searches. What app u use after fb. Everything. 

I don’t think this is going to last forever. I feel it’s just a matter of time before privacy standards rise and clap FB.

2021-02-26 13:33:33,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, February 26, 2021. Enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, February 26, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) pulling back while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) rose, rebounding from its worst selloff since October. Market participants continue to nervously eye rising Treasury yields. 

The saga between market makers and retail traders continues. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) temporarily suspended a list of companies from trading due to “questionable trading and social media activity,” according to a statement from the Commission. The SEC alleges that ""Certain social media accounts may be engaged in a coordinated attempt to artificially influence their share prices.” A full list of the halted securities can be found [here](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/suspensions/2021/34-91213-o.pdf?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery).

On Friday, the U.S. House of Representatives is anticipated to pass a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus package. The bill includes an additional $1,400 in stimulus checks to most Americans, $400 per week in augmented federal unemployment insurance, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government relief. The bill would then head to the U.S. Senate, with many lawmakers aiming to pass the bill before a mid-March cliff for when current pandemic-era benefits are set to expire.

Treasury yields were mostly lower today at 1.424% at the time of writing but continue to hover near one-year highs. Treasury yields are the interest rate the US government pays on its debt obligations, such as bonds. Very basically, rising Treasury yields affect the stock market in two ways: (1) it makes Treasury bonds more attractive assets for investment and (2) raises the cost of borrowing money for companies, which is why high-flying tech stocks were hit particularly hard yesterday.  Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management said, ""Driving rates higher has been a combination of higher growth expectations as well as higher inflation expectations. Until recently, market participants have been able to digest the upward drift in long-term rates, but it appears that the next leg up in interest rates is a bigger bite to chew. Looking at where real yields were at, they were simply too low when considering growth expectations, and it’s likely that long-term real yields will continue to drift higher as economic data improves."" In other words, expectations for more growth in the market, combined with inflationary fears are lowering demand in bonds, which in turn raises the yield. 

**Highlights**

* Robinhood[ disclosed in a filing Friday](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1561014/000162828021003429/fy20rhfshortfinal.pdf) that the company is in talks with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) over outages on the platform during the March 2020 market volatility, along with other matters surrounding options trading and communications with customers on the platform.
* DigitalOcean and Olo are two tech companies that recently filed to go public. DigitalOcean is a cloud-computing company, while Olo provides restaurant software.

2021-02-04 14:07:26,ACTIVISION/BLIZZARD (ATVI): Today’s earnings call and some unique numbers make this is an interesting stock I wish I had jumped on.,"Right now, Activision is having its quarterly earnings call. Reports are saying $3.05 billion versus $2.78 billion expected, and earnings per share: $1.21 versus $1.17 expected:

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/activision-blizzard-q4-earnings-2020-210514360.html

I don’t own any at the moment, but I wish I had made a major investment. I had been filtering stocks, and a few stats about Activision stuck out to me. Activision has:

* Over 70% gross profit margin
* Over 30% growth in earnings per share this quarter
* Over 30% growth in sales this quarter
* Positive sales growth over past five years
* P/E under 40

Only five other large cap stocks share these characteristics:

* Alexandria Real Estate - ARE
* Facebook - FB			
* Horizon Therapeutics - HZNP
* KKR & Co. - KKR
* Vertex Pharma - VRTX			

Every other stock with those growth, sales, and margin numbers are stocks with insanely high P/E ratios, like Etsy (123) or NovoCure (2486 lol). But you’ve got this group of stocks with what looks like value P/E ratios under 40: Activision, Facebook, two medical tech companies, and two financial companies. And all of them are generally regarded as strong buys. 

But there’s something unique in my mind about Activision. Biotech is volatile, prone to setbacks on a technical or regulatory level even before you start talking business fundamentals. And I know the finance companies are good buys. But Activision’s business model seems more insulated from the some of the pitfalls of the market. It was a strong COVID business and not one that I personally see taking a post-COVID recovery hit. 

This is one of those rare companies where the numbers looks fantastic, I’m familiar with the industry, and I like the company’s products. I’ll probably get invested soon. Just going to wait to see how its price responds to the earnings call. I'd be very interested to hear what others think.",66,0.93

2020-09-03 23:08:37,FB stock - Data Privacy - Reason to be concerned?,"Hi,

With the rising concern about privacy and the user's sensibility of companies collecting data, should Facebook investors be concerned?

Watching this Apple ad, I believe in the long run this will become the norm in the industry and in the apps/websites as well. I believe third-party *Log-ins* such as Facebook when creating an account somewhere is becoming less and less used, for one, I believe people are becoming more and more aware on how companies store data so they use their e-mail instead + more competition (Apple Log-In is now feature in every app in the App Store).

In the long run, could this impact Facebook's ability to gather as much data as today or in the past?

If so, how do you think this could impact the company and their ad services?

Is it something to worry about?

Thanks

I have been tracking insider trades for a few weeks now and there are barely any days when I see large amounts of insider buying. Every single day, insiders keep selling their shares without almost any buying activity. That's just alarming to me. I am not predicting a crash or anything, just trying to share what I've observed. Here are some trades from the last few days.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/08/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-8-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Nasdaq set for sharp drop after Friday’s comeback

> * U.S. stock futures were mostly lower Monday, with a sharp drop in the Nasdaq and tech names indicated to start the new week after Friday’s big turnaround. Tesla shed another 2% in the premarket after closing Friday below $600 per share for the first time since early December. The stock has lost a third of its value since its all-time intraday high in late January.

> * The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Friday all broke three-session losing streaks, with strong advances. For the week, the Dow and S&P 500 gained 1.8% and 0.8%, respectively. However, the Nasdaq dropped 2% last week. The Dow and S&P 500 were up nearly 3% and 2.3%, respectively, since the beginning of the year. The Nasdaq was just above breakeven ahead of Monday’s open.

*****

> # 2. Treasury yields rise after Senate Covid relief bill passage

> * Senate passage of the $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill Saturday wasn’t enough to put stocks in the green Monday as more economic stimulus on top of an already recovering economy continued to stoke inflation concerns. That’s pushing bond yields higher Monday, with the 10-year Treasury yield trading around 1.6%, shy of Friday’s one-year high. The 10-year yield has risen rapidly since the end of January, adding more than 0.5% in a little over a month.

*****

> # 3. Biden says direct payments of up to $1,400 going out soon

> * The Democratic-held House aims to pass the Senate-approved Covid stimulus package on Tuesday and then send it President Joe Biden for his signature. The bill approved in the Senate on Saturday comes with a smaller, compromise federal unemployment benefits boost and without a federal minimum wage increase. The legislation includes direct payments of up to $1,400 to most Americans, which Biden said Saturday could start going out within two weeks.

*****

> # 4. Stocks to watch: Disney, Comcast, GameStop, GE

> * Shares of Disney rose more than 1% in Monday’s premarket trading after California officials on Friday cleared theme parks to open at reduced capacity on April 1.

> # 5. Oil prices rise after Saudi Arabia facilities attacked

West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, also moved higher, trading above $66 at nearly a two-year high.

2021-02-14 21:48:02,My first attempt at a stocks to watch list/DD,"Hi! I've been getting into investing a lot recently, and I'm doing this mainly for my own experience. I'll take any feedback or comments y'all have. Let me know what you think of my first list!

To start off, I want to disclose how I picked this list. I used Morgan Stanley's stock screener to find tickers with their ""overweight"" rating and a price below their given price target (if applicable). Next, I would cross-reference that with RH and Zack's stock analysis. Finally, I would search for each ticker on Reddit in order to see what the sentiment towards the stock was. After compiling the list, I went through each stock individually again and assigned it a ranking of 1-5 (1 being safe, 5 being more speculative/risky), as well as providing a hypothetical dollar amount that I would invest in at the current price.

The goal of this list was to pick a balanced portfolio between aggressive growth and long term consistency. I have a huge bias towards semiconductors, biomedical, tech, and industrial/material.

I'll start with the stocks I gave a 1 rating

1. MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, FB, AAPL ($8k in each)

I believe these will be here for a loooong time as well as continue to grow. These seem pretty safe to me and make up the foundation of this portfolio

Now we get to stocks with a 2 rating. These are my favorites, as I see them having high growth potential and staying power (still riskier than 1s, however)

2. NVDA, AMD, TXG, AMAT, MT, VALE, RTX, TDG, QRVO, NIO, TSLA ($5k in each)

 Now we get on to the 3s! These will follow a similar pattern of higher risk, less amount invested.

3. TER, LRCX, ON, MCHP, FSLY, CRSR, RDSB, DOCU ($3k in each)

Now we get to the 4s. These are mostly speculative

4. SPCE, ANTM, NET, ACAD, ABCL ($2k in each)

That list was pretty short. The 5s will be the most risky/most speculative. They will have the lowest amount invested in them.

5. TGH, SEDG, HUM, AMKR.

Oh and positions: 20 VOO, 62 QQQ, 28 LIT, and 54 PLTR. If you made it to the end of this post, thank you!",26,0.79

AAPL, MSFT, FB are the biggest tech companies that I believe have huge potential, however I don't know whether they can out perform the other stock.

NFLX pretty much owns the streaming industry aside from what I believe are petty competition from Disney+ and Prime video.

TSLA already OWNS the entire EV industry and I see a very, very bright future.

As for V, I don't see credit cards going anywhere anytime soon.

NVDA is a big one as the gaming industry is continuously growing year by year without signs of stopping.

BABA is basically China's version of AMZN and has revenues of over $50B USD.

There are a few headlines to consider... some say it was hedgefunds selling to cover their losses, others say it was the J&J trials posting results that fell below expectations, and others say we are at the beginning of a complete crash (maybe a correction, but a complete crash is unlikely).  Ultimately, for the investor sell-offs can be healthy and can present buying opportunities.  Full disclosure, I haven't bought a single share of GME, AMC, BB, or NOK.  I have my eyes set on other buying opportunities--opportunities that I think will continue to pay off in the long run.  These are stocks where I slightly increased my positions in today and will continue to consider buying next week depending on how the markets play out.  **Even when you see a buying opportunity, you don't all-in on one given day.  You don't know what the next day/week/month will look like.**

&#x200B;

1. **WMT:**  WMT has had a \~7% dip since hitting 150.  WMT has plans to really ramp up its presence in the advertising industry, which, in my opinion, has a lot of potential.  WMT has 250M customers on a weekly basis, globally.  They are planning to release their consumer data to companies, which would be an incredible source of information for those in the ad industry. To compare, Amazon tallied about 26M transactions per week which is about 182 M per week.  WMT has made it clear that it wants to increase its revenue from ads 10+ times within the next 5 years.
2. **Apple:** INCREDIBLE earnings beat.  Can't emphasize that enough.  There is so much already publicized about Apple's amazing quarter.  Yet, the price has fallen \~8%.  It's likely that Apple has more room to grow as Apple has announced that they'd be producing their own chips.  Consumers who are looking for a computer upgrade, are likely to hold until Apple's newest technology comes out.  Tim Cook is always looking to push Apple's presence and innovation.  I'm looking to increase my position in Apple.
3. **Visa:**  Another great earnings beat followed by a sell-off.  I'm looking at this as a great buying opportunity.  This is more of a macro trend play.  Visa did well given its boost in consumers shopping online.  I can only see a company like Visa doing better as cities begin to open up once the pandemic begins to clear.  There's a pent up demand to travel, to be out, to buy into experiences that we haven't been able to do for almost a year now.  Visa's fintech plays may not have worked out, but Visa is here to stay.

2021-02-11 11:22:19,Amazon stock DD and reason to keep holding,"I bought majority of my amazon stock on sep 2020, and now I heard many people saying amzn is not moving and providing any gain for the past few month, so I am going to list few reasons that why you should keep holding the stock. 

1. The e-commerce and cloud giant has had a $5 billion share repurchase program in place since February 2016, the last time Amazon bought back any of its stock was the first quarter of 2012, so the streak is 33 quarters of no stock buyback. But with the new ceo coming, he might change and start to repurchase the stock, remember before tim cook take over apple, apple did not give out any dividend, and then it changed. 

2. Prime member engagement keep increasing and prime membership is still growing yoy. All major product categories demand continue to raise across globally. 

3. Amazon high growing aws and advertising revenue streams are getting more profitable, the advertising division could keep growing and getting some market share from fb and google.  

4. Amazon bottom line is improving much better compared to analysts predictions, the last few quarters it beats expectations by a lot. With the covid situation getting more under control, the covid related expenses will mitigate, and amazon will be more profitable. 

5. Amazon delivery fleet is growing, I have seen my packages constantly delivered by amazon vans and contractors. In the future, amazon will be less dependent on USPS, fedex and UPS, and might even able to compete with UPS and Fedex. 

6. Finally the stock split, with the new ceo coming, this might become possible as well, this will be a positive catalyst that all investors want to see.

I will be keep holding my amazon stock, if it really dip further, I will buy more, I will hold amazon stock until I retire.",25,0.85

Instead they did so much stock buyback, and dividend payout instead of buying companies when they had the chance like TSLA, NFLX, others... Biggest AAPL acquisition was Beats headphone business lol Now there is talk of Apple car and Apple TV already sucks. Are they just wuss? what are they afraid of in buying successful business like their competitors. 

Even though apple is the biggest company right now, thinking long term 10-15 years from now. I actually think when its all set and done, I see AMZN and MSFT to be WAY bigger companies than AAPL. Because they have shown risk taking and investing in other companies and successfully vertically integrating that in their business model

&#x200B;

TL;DR

Just to be clear, we all know apple is not going anywhere. They are still going to be printing money and growing their business steadily. But I personally don't see them to be on top in future because they are stubborn and not as aggressive.",0,0.32

2021-02-04 17:23:39,Livent (LTHM) is a Great Play on EV," Here's my take on Livent, which is due to report 4Q earnings on February 20th.

**Investment Thesis**

Livent’s primary source of revenue is lithium, a key component for electric batteries. Livent is one of the five major suppliers of lithium worldwide and the only pure-play provider in North America. We view Livent as well positioned to leverage the global transition from internal combustion engines (ICE) to electric vehicles (EV), due to its significant technology expertise, global supply chain, and partnerships with OEMs, including Tesla. Hence, Livent’s premium valuation accurately reflects the company’s ability to gain share in a growing market driven by a favorable regulatory environment and an increasing sense of corporate responsibility. 

**Key Catalysts:** 

\- *Favorable regulatory environment will drive EV adoption.* China is the largest and fastest growing market for EVs, followed by Europe. China recently extended tax exemptions for EVs while Europe enacted the European Climate Law with the goal of making Europe climate neutral by 2050. We expect the Biden administration to pursue similar policies, albeit of a more incremental nature. Additionally, corporations are increasingly adopting energy efficient targets as part of a greater awareness of their social responsibility. We view the favorable regulatory environment as the primary catalyst for EV adoption and one that is largely sustainable regardless of political and social changes.   

\- *Livent is well positioned to leverage the growing market for nickel-rich batteries.* Within the electric battery market, nickel-rich batteries are generally preferred for high performance EVs. Nickel-rich batteries require lithium hydroxide, which Livent produces through a two-stage chemical process. Livent estimates the market share for nickel-rich batteries should increase from about 25% today to 75% by the end of the decade.

\- *Recent demand uptick suggests pricing likely to recover.* Lithium pricing had been under pressure due to a supply glut heading into 2020 which the pandemic exacerbated by reducing demand. (Lithium pricing contracts are long-term although lithium carbonate pricing has declined more than 50% since the beginning of the pandemic.) Industry experts currently estimate lithium pricing needs to rise by roughly 10% to incentivize suppliers to expand capacity. We believe this scenario is likely to occur given some recent encouraging signs, including robust October sales of EVs in China and Europe. 

\- *Scale and Argentina operations offer relative cost advantage.* Regardless of the trajectory of the pricing rebound, however, Livent has a relative cost advantage due to its brine-based Argentina mine, which is more cost efficient than spodumene mines [\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn1). Additionally, Livent is vertically integrated enabling it to capture value along every step of the supply chain. Longer-term, lithium suppliers are pursuing alternatives such as the potential to mine lithium from clay and recycling existing batteries to insulate margins from global disruptions. Although supply may eventually be impacted by new entrants such as Bolivia and India, there are significant political and logistical hurdles which will need to be overcome.

**Company Description**

Livent is a pure play lithium company headquartered in Philadelphia, PA. The company went public in 2018 as a spin-off from FMC Corporation. Livent extracts lithium from its plant in Argentina and then converts the metal into lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide, which are the critical components for electric batteries. Analysts forecast Livent to generate $400mn in revenue in 2021 and EBITDA margins in the high-teens. 

Livent recently extended its supply agreement with Tesla through 2021. We expect this contract to be renewed past the current term. Livent also entered into a joint venture with private equity firm Pallinghurst Resources to buy Canada's lithium projects, which are spodumene based. Through the JV, New Nemaska Lithium, Livent will own 25% of the economics, which should provide economies of scale for its North American operations.

**Industry and Market Opportunity**

Lithium is an alkali metal found in natural substances such as rocks. Lithium is extremely light, a property which makes it ideal for storing energy. In its pure form, lithium actually has an energy density equivalent to gasoline although a typical EV car battery has a much lower density due to the additional inputs required such as casings and electrolyte fluid. In addition to Livent, there are four other global players of which Livent is one of only two providers in North America. 

The lithium opportunity is primarily tied to growth in electric batteries although grid storage is emerging as a secondary use case. (Despite the attention paid to electric cars, electric buses are actually further along the adoption curve due to scale benefits.) Battery sales accounted for 65% of global lithium demand in 2019 and analysts are forecasting this percentage to continue to rise steadily. Given lithium is a commodity, the only limiting supply factor is a price high enough to warrant mining. A third party research firm, Fortune Business Insights, estimates that the global [lithium market](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=rnOqyS-E5qWpEUFLoMeh3w3gSgw-u8NK1t-DXVE8CZI_qSX_FG7DaFbNfwOY1GCj8-hZsRn-ezuSitWBnrb4WpkSApmUiWBUpkd_X_Ms4WGIMiFgBeI_XOUAv_u0vuyiAnFinChKftDQSSS8I1GZbg==) opportunity will reach $8.24 billion by the end of 2027, up from $4.1 billion in 2019 (9.2% CAGR) while demand is expected to increase almost tenfold over the next decade.

Deloitte and IHS Markit forecast EVs to account for approximately 30% of total passenger car and light duty vehicles by 2030.

&#x200B;

**Financials and Valuation** 

Approximately 80% of Livent’s revenue is generated from sales of battery-grade lithium hydroxide and butyllithium. Energy storage is the primary use case for Livent’s batteries, including rechargeable batteries for EVs, portable electronics and grid storage systems. Approximately 65% of Livent’s sales are from Asia, followed by North America (20%) and Europe (15%).

3Q review: Revenue improved sequentially as demand slowly returned although margins and Adjusted EPS missed consensus due to COVID-related costs. The company did not provide 4Q guidance although management noted volumes should continue to improve. 

4Q and 2021 Outlook: Industry experts were originally forecasting a flattish year for global lithium demand but have since revised their 2020 estimates upward to reflect an uptick in EV sales late this year. Hence, we believe there is upside to 4Q consensus. For 2021, analysts are forecasting revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of $400 million and $75 million, respectively. Given the required capacity demands, Livent is not expected to be cash-flow positive for the foreseeable future.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/16/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-16-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Stock futures mixed after Dow, S&P 500 closed at record highs again

> * U.S. stock futures were mixed Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 little changed after they both closed again at record highs to start the week. Nasdaq futures rose Tuesday, adding to Monday’s 1.1% gain, which moved the tech-heavy index to just 4.5% away from last month’s record high close.

> * Stocks were able to shake off the 10-year Treasury yield holding around 1.6% on Monday and Tuesday, after hitting an over one-year high of 1.642% on Friday. Rapidly rising bond yields have recently been a drag on growth stocks as higher interest rates erode the value of future profits and compress market valuations.

*****

> # 2. Fed to begin March meeting with polices under scrutiny

> * The Federal Reserve, which begins its two-day March meeting Tuesday, will be watching bond yields and the latest reading on retail sales. Economists expect the government’s February data to show a 0.4% increase in retail sales following a 5.3% surge in January. With the Fed’s extraordinarily easy monetary measures during Covid under scrutiny, the nation’s central bank is set to release new economic and interest rate forecasts along with its policy statement Wednesday afternoon.

*****

> # 3. Moderna studies Covid vaccine in kids; more countries halt AstraZeneca

> * Moderna has started testing its Covid vaccine in children ranging in age from six months to less than 12 years old. The mid-to-late stage study intends to enroll about 6,750 kids in the U.S. and Canada. In a separate study, which began in December, Moderna is also testing its vaccine in adolescents between 12 and 18 years old. The two-shot vaccine has already been authorized for emergency use in Americans 18 and older.

> * Sweden and Latvia on Tuesday joined a fast-growing list of European nations suspending use of AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine as health regulators proceed with a new review into its side effects after reports of blood clots. Germany, France, Italy and Spain on Monday said they would all stop administering it. However, the World Health Organization and Europe’s drug regulator have recommended that countries continue to use AstraZeneca’s two-shot regimen.

*****

> # 4. Regulators investigating ‘violent’ Tesla crash; Autopilot not ruled out yet

> * The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating what it calls “violent” crash involving a Tesla sedan and a tractor trailer last week in Detroit. Authorities have not yet said whether the electric car maker’s Autopilot, Full Self-Driving or FSD beta may have contributed to the accident. The NHTSA has previously embarked on probes into more than a dozen crashes that were thought to involve Tesla’s advanced driver assist systems.

*****

> # 5. OxyContin maker Purdue proposes $10 billion plan to exit bankruptcy

> * OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma is proposing a $10 billion plan to emerge from bankruptcy protection. Those efforts would include a significant boost, more than $4 billion, from members of the Sackler family who own the Connecticut-based company. Court documents show Purdue officials continued to push to maintain sales of OxyContin even as it became clear the drug was being abused. Complicated litigation is playing out in courts across the country in efforts to hold the drug industry accountable for the nation’s opioid crisis.

Go to your phone's app store and search for social audio/drop-in audio chat/etc. Also take a look through the popular apps in the social category.

* **Twitter** has a competing product: Spaces. Announced late November and soft-launched late December, it looks/feels better and has some functionality Clubhouse is sorely lacking, but it doesn't seem to fulfill the same purpose (which may be intentional). The rooms I've been in have frequently devolved into circular discussions on how Spaces compares to Clubhouse.
* **Facebook** has still failed to deliver a competing product but is reportedly working on a direct competitor (Fireside). The timing of this report is interesting giving Zuck's recent appearance on Clubhouse. He reportedly struggled to understand the app.

The FB news is also *surprisingly late*. Clubhouse is 10+ months old but I guess 2020 moved too fast and broke too many things: resources were stretched thin, their rollouts were slow or messy, even breaking many major third-party apps like Spotify on two occasions (one incident [lasted a few hours](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/05/a-mistake-at-facebook-broke-spotify-venmo-tiktok-and-other-iphone-apps/)). It seems more like Facebook was blindsided by this (on top of everything else).

**How big is it?**

Clubhouse went from \~10k to \~100k users from August to November, it passed the one million mark just over a month ago and is on track to pass 20 million by March.

It seems like everyone is rushing into the social audio space, but the technology and infrastructure required for the core functionality of these apps is costly to build, manage, and run reliably, so just about all of them make heavy use of third-party services for that.

**Which companies provide services for these apps?**

Two publicly-traded companies are Twilio ($TWLO) and Agora ($API), with the latter being the one to watch.

You could say Agora is sort of a *Clubhouse-as-a-Service*, but it's probably more accurate to say the Clubhouse app is largely just a wrapper around the Agora platform, at least on a technical level.

From personal experience talking with founders and software engineers, Agora is what people are choosing when building social audio apps, while Twilio is generally dismissed when I've mentioned it (due to pricing IIRC).

**Note: It looks like $API hadn't really moved much since it's June IPO — until Friday — and few are really aware of just how crucial Agora's services are to Clubhouse.**

**Some media outlets** [**still seem unsure**](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/agora-shares-soar-as-investors-try-to-jump-on-clubhouse-apps-growth.html) **if Clubhouse uses Agora.** Fortunately you can independently confirm it does by monitoring your phone's network traffic while using the app, or digging into the app file if you have the ability to do so.

It also looks like Clubhouse uses Agora's RTM service, likely for managing room data and keeping things in sync such as who's in a room, # of listeners, access/permissions, etc.

**Concerns?**

And finally the most speculative part of this post.

Please feel free to chime in on anything here:

* Agora's pricing is competitive, but it's still a cost — likely a significant cost at Clubhouse scale. It also seems unlikely CH would rely so heavily on another service for its core features without strong agreements in place.
* Clubhouse could eventually develop its own software and infrastructure — but considering the team is so small (\~10 employees) and growth is high, it's probably not very high on their list of priorities. However, they *are* putting a focus on monetization.
* After a huge influx of users from mainland China recently, access to Clubhouse was blocked by the Chinese government. However, it should be noted that **Agora Inc is a Chinese company.**
* The high number of Chinese users despite the many hurdles (iPhone only, app not available on the Chinese App Store, app not in Chinese) suggests high demand in that market for such apps. Could Clubhouse's continued use of Agora win favor with the Chinese government and potential access to the Chinese market? If not, might Agora be the primary choice for a Chinese alternative(s)?
* Considering the growth in this category, there's likely to be some serious competition. Are there any other relevant companies on your radar?
* Will a ""post-COVID"" world significantly affect this category of tech? I don't believe it will but I'm open to other viewpoints.

Final thought: this post talks about Clubhouse and Agora more than other companies, but this discussion is ultimately about the future of these technologies and services and whichever companies provide them well.

2021-02-22 18:13:25,$MNKKQ (Fingers Crossed),"This my first post and I've been only investing in stocks for 2 months. I am a total noob who's just trying to contribute any way I can. I've stumbled upon MNKKQ by accident. I've heard of the company due to it's issues with the opiod situation. Who cares? They're still doing business as usual and I dont think the lawsuits will destroy the company. They had target action date of February 2 for its Stratatech Biologics License Application (BLA) for StrataGraft for deep partial-thickness thermal burns. StrataGraft is an investigational regenerative skin tissue therapy. ***It is being evaluated under priority review***. I think this company can start a turnaround with this product. They have others in the pipeline also. They know what they're doing. I've purchased 500 shares and I'm doubling that amount tomorrow. ***I've been trying hard to research as best as I can and I'd love you guys feedback***.  NOWHERE TO GO BUT UP!!!

**Reason I Like MNKKQ:**

**StrataGraft could be the first biological ""off-the-shelf"" skin substitute product for treatment of severe burns.**

Every year, approximately 10,000 patients in the U.S. are hospitalized for the treatment of severe burns and the market for skin graft products used in this application is estimated to be approximately $300 million in the country.

**Funding from BARDA**

The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has provided funding and technical support for the continued development of StrataGraft under Project BioShield Contract No. HHSO100201500027C.

**Previously, the FDA granted StrataGraft orphan drug status, and it was among the first products designated by the agency as a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) under the provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act.**

The Phase 3 study [found that just 4% of the area ](https://mallinckrodt.gcs-web.com/node/26156/pdf)of the StrataGraft-treated burns needed autografting after three months, and 83% of wounds treated only with StrataGraft “achieved durable wound closure” after three months.

Every year, approximately 10,000 patients in the U.S. are hospitalized for the treatment of severe burns and the market for skin graft products used in this application is estimated to be approximately $300 million in the country.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/16/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-16-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq set to add to record highs

> * U.S. stock futures rose Tuesday, adding to Friday’s record closes for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq. The U.S. stock market was closed Monday for Presidents Day. All three stock benchmarks finished higher last week, in a continuation of February’s strength. For the year, as of Friday’s close, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were up nearly 2.8%, 4.8% and 9.4%, respectively.

> * The 30-year Treasury yield held above 2% early Tuesday as investors watched for progress on President Joe Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion Covid stimulus package on Capitol Hill and the push for wider distribution of coronavirus vaccines across the U.S. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to more than 1.26%.

*****

> # 2. B/itcoin hit a new high over $50,000

> * B/itcoin reached a new record high Tuesday, going over $50,000 per unit for the first time ever, before paring some of those gains. Major firms announced support for digital currencies last week, starting with Tesla revealing it bought $1.5 billion worth of b/itcoin. Mastercard said Thursday it would support certain c/ryptocurrencies later this year, while BNY Mellon announced the following day it would open up its custody services to digital assets. B/itcoin more than quadrupled in 2020 and it’s up over 60% since the start of this year.

*****

> # 3. Deep freeze in Texas causes massive energy crunch

> * More than 3.8 million households in Texas are in the dark Tuesday morning, as record low temperatures boosted demand for power for heat that pushed the state’s electric grid to its limits. Rolling blackouts, typically seen on 100-degree summer days, were imposed in Texas. The scarcity of power was so great that spot prices of wholesale electricity on the Texas power grid spiked more than 10,000% on Monday. U.S. oil prices also climbed to a pandemic-high above $60 per barrel. The frigid weather was part of a massive winter blast that brought snow, sleet and freezing rain to the southern Plains, across parts of the Ohio Valley and the Northeast.

*****

> # 4. Congress to establish a Capitol riot commission

> * House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Monday that Congress will establish an independent, 9/11-style commission to look into last month’s deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Investigations into the riot were already planned, with Senate hearings scheduled later this month in the Rules Committee.

> * House impeachment prosecutors who argued for Donald Trump’s conviction of inciting the attack said Sunday that they proved their case. Democrats also railed against Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans, saying they were “trying to have it both ways” in finding the former president not guilty while criticizing him.

*****

> # 5. Biden to make first official domestic trips

> * Trying to move beyond Trump’s acquittal in last week’s impeachment trial, Biden plans to keep up a busy schedule focused on the coronavirus in the coming week. Biden is set to make his first official domestic trips of his presidency, starting with a CNN town hall in Wisconsin on Tuesday to talk to Americans impacted by the pandemic. Biden on Thursday then visits a Pfizer Covid vaccine facility in Michigan as the drugmaker’s two-shot regime and Moderna’s start making more inroads into pharmacies around the nation.

The launch of FB gaming, FB shops, IGtv ads have all been priced in at this point (maybe the profits from these products haven't but the announcements themselves are priced in probably). They still have alot more room for growth if they keep innovating with Oculus and I could see them acquire another company at some point this year. Their balance sheet is solid and their earnings look good but how much more room for growth do they really have this year ?",1,0.67
2021-02-19 13:56:24,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, February 19, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, February 19, 2021**

After opening the day higher, stocks pulled back throughout the session to finish in the red, closing out a very volatile week in the stock market. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.17% down, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed 0.44% down, and the Dow (DIA) closed 0.03% down. Even though the major indexes pulled back this week, they continue to hover near record levels as optimism over additional stimulus continues to fuel higher levels of risk tolerance among market participants. 

There are many encouraging developments surrounding the coronavirus. This week, the United States averaged 77,665 new coronavirus cases per day, a drop of 43% from the average of two weeks ago, according to data analyzed by the New York Times. Furthermore, [analysis from Bloomberg on Thursday ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-18/how-many-vaccine-doses-are-available-u-s-should-see-a-surge?srnd=premium)showed that the U.S. vaccine supply is poised to double from the current rate of 10 million to 15 million doses per week within the next few weeks, allowing more shots to be given in the near-term.

Thursday night, in an interview with CNBC, Treasury Secretary Yellen said a large stimulus package is still necessary to build up sufficient momentum for economic recovery to take off on its own. She said, “We think it’s very important to have a big package \[that\] addresses the pain this has caused – 15 million Americans behind on their rent, 24 million adults and 12 million children who don’t have enough to eat, small businesses failing. I think the price of doing too little is much higher than the price of doing something big. We think that the benefits will far outweigh the costs in the longer run,” she added.” 

Despite a record low supply and a temporary pullback in December, the housing market remains very strong. According to a report by the National Association of Realtors, sales ended the month of January at a seasonally adjusted, annualized rate of 6.69 million units. That figure is 0.6 higher than December and 23.7% higher when compared with January 2020 and the second-highest sales pace since April 2006.

2021-01-22 09:19:23,is it really 'too late',"i'm relatively new to investing and so far have about $2,000 invested in a few companies. The only 'big' one is Apple and I only ended up buying 6 shares. as i'm sure a lot of people experienced it when they first started, i was soooooooooo hestitant to pull the trigger and finally did it a few weeks ago. I'm a 23F and have my own house, i have a decent income for my age and a good chunk of change saved in my bank account because i don't have any college debt. (even after buying a house :)  shameless plug) 

when i was looking at investments, i was certain that my choices would be long term holds and that is what i want my portfolio to be! i do not need this cash right away, which is the point of me feeling comfortable with chunk by chunk investing.

as i explain my short backstory, i'm looking at those tried and true companies that we know are going to be around for a while..and i know the point of the stock market is it being unknown but am i too late to jump on board with these companies below? IF i do, is it even worth it to only grab a handful of shares so far? i don't really want to drop 50K in stocks right now....

Tesla

Microsoft

Amazon (eeeeeeek)

Facebook

Mercadolibre

Alibaba

Fedex--seems like the black sheep of this group

Disney--i think i could come to this conclusion on my own, my friend told me that you can start with a stock that may be meaningful to you, or something that in your everyday life you may already follow or know about. Disney is definitely that for me, but just because of the unpredictability of COVID i haven't pulled the trigger even though i have a feeling this would be a long term hold that would be just fine.

&#x200B;

Obviously i'm not going to go and buy all of these---i purposefully wanted to pick these high valued stocks that aren't the $30-$60 companies that make out the rest of my (small) portfolio

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 1st, 2021.

# **Wall Street braces for bumpy trading in the week ahead as the GameStop short squeeze unfolds - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/wall-street-braces-for-bumpy-trading-in-the-week-ahead-as-the-gamestop-short-squeeze-unfolds.html)**
*****
> Earnings news from Amazon and Alphabet, the important January jobs report and Washington’s discussion of stimulus could all be important to markets in the week ahead, but none of it is likely to get more attention than the short squeezes driven by retail investors.
*****
> Stocks had a rocky week, with the S&P 500 down 3.3% to 3,714. The S&P was down 1.1% for January, its first negative month since October and a warning for the year, according to the old Wall Street adage.
*****
> “We were due for some type of decline. We’ve been straight up since October. It’s not unusual that we’re backing off a bit,” said Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities.
*****
> Trading could remain bumpy in the coming week, as the S&P 500 struggles to hold above 3,716 its 50-day moving average and a key technical level.
*****
> “This is the first time we’re at the 50-day moving average since early November,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “It’s just a level we haven’t seen in a while and it’s an important first line in the sand of whether the market uses this as a pivot spot to bounce again.”
*****
> “The buy the dip mentality doesn’t die easy, but if you break that [50-day], that portends something else,” he said.
*****
> Massocca and others see little impact on the broader market from the phenomena of retail investors piling into stocks that are being shorted by big investors. Fueled by no fee trading, retail investors created a flurry of trading in GameStop and other heavily shorted names, like AMC Entertainment. If the stocks rise, in theory, the firms that are short sellers will have to buy stock to cover, and that activity could drive the price even higher in a so-called short squeeze.
*****
> GameStop was the poster child for that trade this past week. GameStop shares closed 68% higher on Friday, bringing their gain for the week to 400%. The retailer’s shares hit a high of $483 on Jan. 28.
*****
> “This is somewhat isolated,” Massocca said of trading in GameStop and other shorts. He said it may not be a phenomena for that long since there aren’t that many heavily shorted stocks. “I think they may be hunting new names.”
*****
> The short squeeze story has garnered broad interest, in the general news media and from Washington.
*****
> Lawmakers from both parties are eager to look into the fact that Robinhood and other online brokers restricted trading in the hottest short names when trading was frenzied. Robinhood said it was responding to SEC rules on net capital requirements and clearinghouse deposits that brokers have to comply with.
*****
> “This was the busiest week for earnings reported with 82% of the companies reported better than expected earnings. It’s a really good quarter, but obviously overshadowed by the short squeeze news,” said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management.
*****
> He said some of the biggest tech names have been lagging, like Apple and Microsoft.
*****
> “The combination of demanding valuations and short squeeze news has overshadowed a really good performance of corporate earnings so far,” Grohowski said. “We’re constructive on the market. Fundamentals do look encouraging to us.”
*****
> Strategists have expected a pullback in the first part of the year, and many say it would become a buying opportunity. Hedge funds did sell long positions in the past week, but firms like Morgan Stanley and Barclays say the de-leveraging is not likely to have a big impact on stocks.
*****
> But for investors who end up buying in at the end of the short squeezes, they could feel some pain.
*****
> “I do think this isn’t going to end well,” said Grohowski. “These kind of one way trades they don’t end well particularly for those that come later to the party.”
*****
> “I think this will be one of those,” he said. “GameStop is not worth what it is trading for today. I do believe at the end of the day the value of a company is important and it’s going to be driven by fundamentals. These dislocations and distortions of value, they will correct and many will be hurt by that.”
*****
> But Grohowski said it’s encouraging that the surge in retail activity was driven by younger investors.
*****
> “We’ve wanted for some time for this younger generation to be more interested in the financial markets and equity investing,” he said. “I know a lot of experienced market participants were not anticipating it being this way. It’s not just a one time kind of distortion.
*****
> “I think this is thought-provoking in terms of a way a younger generation might be looking at investing, by their rules, not the rules of the traditional market participants,” Grohowski added.
*****
> He expects the January employment report to get some attention Friday, and it should be weaker with just 50,000 to 60,000 jobs added.
*****
> He said the markets will also monitor the progress of stimulus discussions in Washington, as valuations have risen on expectations of a package coming soon. President Joe Biden has proposed $1.9 trillion in spending, but Republicans are not in agreement.

> # How Stocks Perform in a President’s First Year

> 2021 kicks off the first year of a new four-year presidential cycle. One of the most popular questions we’ve received lately is how have stocks performed historically during this political year.

> For starters, the S&P 500 Index historically has gained 6.8% per year during the first year of the four-year presidential cycle, but stocks have done better when the president was re-elected than when someone new occupied the White House. This makes sense, as a new president could bring new policies and potential uncertainty. Additionally, stocks do better during years three and four under a new president, while they are much weaker early in the cycle.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.27.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, breaking down all the quarters of the four-year presidential cycle shows that the first quarter of the first year in the cycle is one of only two quarters with a negative average return.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.27.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Bigger picture, historically the fourth quarter of the year has been the strongest of the year, with the first quarter the second best on average. Don’t forget, the third quarter is usually a weak one. Please note, below is for all years, not just the first year of the cycle.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.27.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

> We will take a closer look at February returns next week on the blog, but it is worth noting that when a new party is in power in the White House, historically stocks have struggled from late January until early March. “It is interesting, but from around the time of the inauguration to several weeks out, stocks tend to be pretty weak,” according to LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “It may be as simple as new leadership could bring with it new policies and added uncertainty”.

> # Will GameStop Stop The Bull Market?

> “In the short term, the market is a popularity contest. In the long term, the market is a weighing machine.” -Warren Buffett

> The incredible action from some of the most heavily shorted names has investors everywhere wondering what it all means? GameStop (GME) specifically has taken the country’s imagination by storm, as the stock started the year under $20 per share and this morning nearly hit $500.

> Please note, we aren’t allowed to discuss individual equities, and in no way are we recommending any stocks in this blog, but from a bigger perspective, what is happening here? Basically, individual investors are using message boards like Reddit to find some of the most shorted stocks, then they all pile in at the same time, forcing large institutions to cover their shorts, and thus producing massive buying pressure.

> LPL Research doesn’t think these parabolic moves reflect an overall unhealthy market, but institutions covering shorts at sizable losses may be removing capital from some big cap names. “While these developments could be another sign of excessive optimism in certain segments of the equity markets, we do not believe they represent a sign of a broader market bubble or indicate a major correction is forthcoming,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Don’t forget, overall market breadth is extremely healthy and the credit markets are functioning just fine—we don’t see a repeat of 1999 like some are claiming.”

> Lastly, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, after a 72% rally in the S&P 500 Index (and more in small caps and the Nasdaq), maybe it is simply time for a break. After all, the current bull market has tracked almost perfectly the start of the 1982 and 2009 bull markets thus far, and both of those took a break for a few months starting around this point in the cycle.

> # Most Heavily Shorted Stocks at the End of 2020 and Now

> In the table below, we show the 20 stocks in the Russell 3000 that currently have the highest short interest as a percentage of float. It should come as no surprise that GameStop (GME) still tops that list with 122.97% of float short as of the most recent data for mid-month. That is even after a 21.36 percentage point drop from the end of 2020 when 144.34% of shares were short. It was also the most heavily shorted stock then. The runner-up is Dillard's (DDS) which currently has 83.04% of shares sold short compared to over 90% at the end of 2020. Again, despite that sizeable decline in the percentage of shares sold short, it was also the second most heavily shorted stock one month ago. Of the rest of the top 20, there are six other names with lower short interest than the end of last year. Looking across the rest of the most heavily shorted stocks, Sumo Logic (SUMO), American Well Corp (AMWL), and Sunpower (SPWR) are the stocks that have seen their short interest as a percentage of equity float rise the most. In terms of stock price performance, SPWR has been the one with the biggest rally having doubled YTD. The only other stock that has doubled YTD in this cohort has been GME.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012921-Short-2.png))**

> In the table below, we show the stocks that have seen the biggest changes in the percent of shares sold short between the end of 2020 and the most recent data as of January 15th. Those currently in the top 20 most shorted stocks are highlighted in gray. Across the entire Russell 3,000, 1,777 stocks have seen their short interest as a percent of short move lower in the two week period from the end of December to mid-January. As shown, even after the massive short squeeze that has taken place, GME is actually not the stock that has seen the biggest decline in shorts. Relay Therapeutics (RLAY) holds that title with a 22.62 percentage point decline. That is even though the stock has experienced a relatively smaller move than some of its peers. Granted, a number of other stocks like nCino (NCNO) and Berkeley Lights (BPYU) to name a few have actually moved lower so far in 2020 and have also seen their short interest decline significantly. On the other end of the spectrum, WW International (WW) has seen its short interest rise the most.

> # Funding Markets Full of Cash

> US funding markets are awash with liquidity thanks to ongoing QE purchases by the Fed and the progression of fiscal policy since the end of the year, as well as normal seasonal tailwinds that see more liquidity after year-end balance sheet constraints would roll off. Funding markets refer to collateralized, short-term lending via repo and related wholesale cash transactions.

> Government money market funds that are allowed to conduct repo operations as well as buying Treasury and Agency debt are seeing roughly typical inflows, but those come on top of record share of overall money market funds. As a result, repo rates have been plunging. The secured overnight financing rate, which tracks the volume-weighted general collateral repo rate has fallen to 3 basis points above the bottom of the Fed Funds target range. While repo rates falling below the Fed Funds target range wouldn’t be a catastrophe and some parts of the market have gotten there, it’s not in the FOMC’s interest to have funding rates trading far outside its target policy rate range on a regular basis.

> The solution already exists, of course: the NY Fed has a standing overnight reverse repo facility first introduced back in 2013 which is likely to start draining cash as investors seek higher returns than the repo markets offer. Reserve scarcity, which roll-off brought to bear in 2018 and 2019, is now reserve plenty, and so many reserves exist that the NY Fed will start draining them with reverse repos. Reserve balances will continue to grow this year thanks to QE purchases and an expected decline in the balance of the federal government's transaction account at the Federal Reserve.

> # Federal Reserve Rebukes Hawkish Rumors; Reaffirms Support

> It has been a busy past 12 months for the Federal Reserve (Fed), after the onset of the global pandemic prompted historic stimulus from monetary policymakers. With the economy showing signs of being in the early stages of expansion, some have speculated that the Fed may begin to slow the pace of its asset purchases. Recent comments from some Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members that have hinted that the Fed’s bond buying program could be reduced by the end of the year, has signaled that other policymakers may be thinking that way, too.

> Adding fuel to the speculation, the 10-year Treasury yield has been climbing, breaking above 1% for the first time since March 2020 as the economy has expanded. Meanwhile, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, breakeven inflation rates—the yield difference between Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and nominal Treasuries—have risen to levels not seen since 2018, suggesting that inflation expectations are heating up, although levels still remain largely benign.

2020-04-13 17:15:55,"ETF with largest exposure to Googl, Amzn, Fb, MSFT, V","Hi guys,

First time investor - looking at ETFs. I realized instead of buying the 5 stocks mentioned above, maybe I can look at a etf that has good exposure to all 5. I plan to buy and play long, 

I looked around and of course saw the usual suspects - VOO, QQQ, SPY, XLK seemed like good options and their leveraged ones TQQQ/TECL. I so far like SKYY the most as it has Citrix VMware BABA etc. But not as much exposure as I'd like to the big guys, also Is there a leveraged SKYY version? 

However most of the above seem to have APPL as the first/second most invested stock (except Skyy) while I would like it to be Googl Amzn or MSFT as the top 3 exposed. Any ideas please which ETF does this ?

Right now I have only about 3k USD to invest, I was thinking 2k in SKYY (or an alternative) 500$ GDX AND 500$ VDC. Any alternatives would be appreciated as my thinking is tech, consumer and commodity (debating oil over gold) 

Appreciate the help",0,0.5

2021-01-17 00:32:22,The rotation portfolio,"We can all see that the market is a bit extended and frothy. The safest thing you can do during a downturn is shift into undervalued stocks (not necessarily traditional ""value stocks""). When everything is trading at an extreme premium, it's a good idea to move into stocks that are trading at a discount. I dont see most cruises/oil/airlines as value because there's a difference between plain cheap and undervalued. Undervalued stocks are good businesses whose price for whatever reason has not kept up with a companies outlook. Below are some of my personal favorites at the moment.

#Cyclical

MED- how can a company whose price has increased 626% in the last 5 years be undervalued? By being a top 5 fastest growing company (source: Forbes). Forward p/e and ev/EBITDA are both under 20 and peg is near 1. The profit margin and growth rate are mouth watering. With a market cap of just 2.4b they have miles and miles to run. They shouldn't be this cheap.

LKQ- A peg ratio of just 0.48 and managing to grow earnings in a pandemic earns them a spot on this list. The last 2 earnings have beat estimates by 231% and 41% respectively. They're expected to grow by 33.5% per annum the next 5 years, astounding considering their low multiplies. By every metric they're extremely underpriced and not for any negative reasons.

Honorable mention: LGIH

#Defensive

ACI- They're growing faster than Kroger and trading at lower multiples. Peg ratio of 0.3 is almost unheard of. Their debt remains fairly high from the Safeway purchase several years ago but it's really paid off in growth. As they continue knocking down long term liabilities we'll see them climb closer to $30.

Honorable mention: DG

#Industrial

BLD- One of the 16 companies that come up when screening a strict combination of growth and value measurements. Home improvement will continue to be popular as people move out of cities and work from home remains part of the modern work life. Excellent margins and expected EPS growth.

Honorable mentions: CSL

#Tech

CACI- This more mature version of PLTR has a great price/free cash flow ratio, low forward p/e and ev/EBITDA, good profit margins, and substantial growth. They've taken a loss of 8% over the last year in share price while nearly maintaining their growth rate through the pandemic. Solid margin of safety here and possiblity for a huge jump in price at some point.

SNX- They recently spun off their sibling company CNXC and it was expected that SNX would see slowed growth while CNXC grew rapidly. The first earnings report since the split showed the exact opposite to be the case. A bit weird seeing a tech company trade at an 8 pe, especially considering how business has picked up recently. A steady performer that won't fall far in a crash.

SSNC- earnings in 2018? 103m. Earnings in 2019? 438m. Earnings in 2020 through 3 quarters? 430m. They continue to grow earnings yet the share price has risen a meager 6% the last year. Peg ratio under 1, profit margin at 12%, and an excellent price/free cash flow make this a great discounted buy.

Honorable mention: JBL

#Communication

FB- The 1st really big name on the list. Nothing seems to stand in the way of their growth but we've only seen modest returns for it. Theres always the risk of them being forced to break up but the sum of the parts are worth more than the whole in this case. With the overall market froth you'd expect these guys to be at $300 by now.

#Healthcare

HZNP- They blasted off into profitability last year and havent looked back. Their multiples are much too low for a company experiencing this much success. Hedge fund interest plotted on a chart over the last year is is a vertical line straight up. Intrinsic value from dcf puts this at just over $100 while it trades at $78. One of the most undervalued stocks imo.

HUM- Theres no reason this should be below $450 but here we are. Their return in capital is at 24% where the industry average is 10%. An encouraging sign for future growth. The multiples look great as well.

Honorable mention: ELMD

#Financial

PJT- While looking at their share price gain and p/e compared to the rest of the financial sector you'd think I was crazy for calling this stock undervalued. A deeper look will point out just how undervalued they are. Through 3 quarters they've already beat 2018 and 2019's earnings combined. That puts their peg ratio at 0.7. Much too low. Charting their revenue and earnings out over the last few years paints an impressive picture of sustainable growth. 

PFSI- The number one most underpriced stock in the entire market. Period. 3.3 p/e and 0.1 peg ratio. All while exhibiting unbelievable growth and margins. Hedge funds are stuffing into this stock like a clown car, the number of funds investing in them has doubled in just one year. I believe the market has priced in a ""top"" of the housing market. By the time it actually starts to decline we'll see interest rates rise which should only help PFSI.

Honorable mention: OMF

#Real Estate

CBRE- Like OMF this stock got hurt by the pandemic but should be back on track this year. They have an impressive 30.5% margin of safety. The robust balance sheet supports the acquisition moves aimed at expanding their geographical reach.

#Basic Materials

GOLD- Warren Buffet was on the right track buying Barrick last year and the reasoning hasn't really changed. Massive stimulus building supports the gold bull case long term. 

Honorable mention: FMC

#Utilities

DTE- Only one utility company is expected to see EPS growth while having a forward p/e under 30, a peg ratio under 3, and decent price/cash flow. I dont have them being notably under intrinsic value but if you're going to own a utility that isnt renewable this is the one.",33,0.89
2020-08-27 18:58:08,"How I applied Buffet's strategies to my own portfolio, +70% networth, beat SP500 by 40%","I believe I did pretty well in the market this year. My networth increased ~65% since its lowest point in March, [~350k to 620k](https://imgur.com/a/3Vu6u2f). 20k from the car I bought in March. I rolled over a 401k and it messed up Mint's reporting, hence the spike from Jul -> Aug. 

I beat the [SP500 by 40%](https://imgur.com/a/adeDokD) in my YOLO account, my FAANG account went from [180->300](https://imgur.com/a/kBmBp1O)

I did this by following some basic investing principles, buying and holding for the most part, being patient, and only investing in areas which I have expertise in. 

I did not buy into the TSLA hype, nor do I play options, nor do I play crypto. 

#High level advice:
=========================================

I picked the 7 I agree with.

1. Invest in what you know…and nothing more.
2. Never compromise on business quality
3. When you buy a stock, plan to hold it forever
4. Diversification can be dangerous
5. Most news is noise, not news (don't read articles about investing)
8. The best moves are usually boring (buy and hold)
10. Only listen to those you know and trust 

I firmly believe that anyone who follows those concepts, they will find success in investing.  

#General mindset:
================
- Keep emotions out of the market
- Don't bother timing the market. Don't get ruled by FOMO.
- Understand that for some stocks, you can't really average cost down. You will have to stomach buying the stock at a higher entry point. My refusal to average up early on caused me to miss out on a lot of gains. 
- Understand the difference between trading, investing, and gambling. 
- Have an exit strategy (stop losses would have helped me a lot in March, I now learned from my expensive mistake)
- Be greedy-- not TOO greedy. If a stock pops 10%, I will sell half to lock in profits. It's super common to see a lot of companies pop and the next day dip a bit due to sell off. Perfect time to grab more on the dip. This is obviously impossible to time, which is why I only sell half. 

#Application:
==================================================================
I was very specific in the types of companies I would choose to invest in within tech. I decided to follow my strengths. As a data engineer, I'm very intimate with cloud technologies, and I think I generally have pretty sharp business acumen and good strategic direction. 

As a result, my day to day work had me using a ton of technologies in the cloud space. I've used Splunk, NewRelic, Twilio, AWS, GCP, Hortonworks/Cloudera, Oracle, Tableau, Datadog, Sendgrid (bought by Twilio), Dropbox/box, Slack, Salesforce, Marketo, Databricks, Snowflake, HP Vertica, just to name a few. I was familiar with CDN services like Fastly and Cloudflare because sometimes, I worked with the DevOps and IT guys. 

Based on industry hearsay, day to day work, eventually, I got a good ""feel"" of what technologies were widely adopted, easy to use, and had a good reputation in the industry. Similarly, I also got a feel for what tech were being considered 'dated' or not widely used (HP, Oracle, Cloudera, Dropbox, Box). 

I tend to shy away from companies that I don't understand. In the past, most times I've done that-- I got burned.  My biggest losers this year was betting on $NAT and $JMNA (10k total loss). After learning from those mistakes, I decided to only focus on investing in companies that either I or my peers have intimate first hand experience with using. Because of this rationale, the majority of stocks in my portfolio are products which I believe in, I thoroughly enjoy using, and I would recommend to my friends, family, and colleagues. 

Post COVID, due to the shift to remote work and increase in online shopping I decided to double down on tech. I already knew that eCommerce was the next big thing. I made very early investments into SHOP and Amazon in 2017 for that reason.

My hypothesis was that post-COVID, the shift on increased online activity, remote work, and eCommerce would mean that companies which build tools to support increased online activity should also increase. I decided to choose three sectors within tech to narrow down-- these were three sectors that I had a good understanding of, due to the nature of my work and personal habits. 

1. eCommerce + AdTech 
2. IT/DevOps (increased online activity means higher need for infra)
3. FinTech (increased shopping activity means more transactions)

These are the points I consider before I consider jumping into a stock:

1. Do I feel good about using the company? Do I believe in the company's vision?
2. Where do I see this company in 5 years? 10 years? Do I see my potential children being around to use these companies?
3. What does YoY, QoQ growth look like for this company? 
4. Is/Will this product be a core part of how businesses or people operate?
5. Who are their customers and target demographic?
6. (SaaS) Customer testimonials, white papers, case studies. If it's for a technology, I'm going to want to read a paper or use case.

In March, I took what I believe to be an ""educated gamble"". When the market crashed, I liquefied most of my non tech assets and reinvested them into tech. Some of the holdings I already had, some holdings were newly purchased.

*EDIT* ^^^ this isn't called timing the market you /r/wsb imbeciles. Timing the market would be trying to figure out when to PULL OUT during ATH and then buying the dip. I SOLD at the lowest point, and I with the cash I sold AT A LOSS, I reinvested that cash and doubled down into tech. If I sold in Feb, and bought back in March, that would be calling timing the market. What I am doing is called REINVESTING/REBALANCING... not timing the market. 

I have 50% of my networth in AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, FB, NFLX, and the rest in individual securities/mutual funds. I have 3 shares of TSLA that I got in @1.5.

Here are the non FAANGs I chose.

1. $SQ. I had already been invested in SQ since 2016. I made several bad trades, holding when it first blew past 90 until I sold it at 70... bought in again last year at 60s, after noticing that more and more B&M stores were getting rid of their clunky POS systems and replacing it with Square's physical readers. After COVID, I noticed a lot of pop up vendors, restaurants doing take out. A Square reader made transactions very easy to make post-COVID. 

2. $ATVI. Call of Duty and Candy Crush print money for them. I've been a Blizzard fanboy since I was a kid, so I have to keep this just out of principle.

3. $SHOP. They turned a profit this year, and I think there is still a lot more room to grow. It's become somewhat of a household name. I've met quite a few people who mentioned that they have a Shopify site set up to do their side hustle. I've tried the product myself, and can definitely attest that it's pretty easy to get an online shop up and running within a day. I 5.5xed my return here. 

4. $BIGC. I bought into this shortly after IPO. I'm very excited to see an American Shopify. BigC focuses on enterprise customers right now, and Shopify independent merchants, so I don't see them directly competing. I'm self aware this is essentially a gamble. I got in at 90, sold at 140, and added more in 120s. I def got lucky here... it's not common for IPOs to pop so suddenly. I honestly wasn't expecting it to pop so soon.

5. $OKTA. Best in class SSO tool. Amazing tool that keeps tracks of all of my sign-ons at work. 

6. $DDOG. Great monitoring tool. Widely adopted and good recommendations throughout the industry. Always had a nice looking booth at GoogleNext.

7. $ZM. Zoom was the only video conf tool at work which I had a good time using. Adoption had blown up pre-COVID already in the tech world, and post-COVID, they somehow became a noun. ""Zoom parties"" and ""Zoom dates"" somehow became a thing interwoven into peoples' day to day lives.

8. $TWLO. Twilio sells APIs which allow applications to send messages like text, voice, and video chat. For example, when DoorDash sends you a text at 1 AM reminding you that your bad decision has arrived, that text is powered by Twilio. In March, New York announced that they were going to use Twilio to send SMS notifs for COVID contact tracing. 

10. $NET/$FSTY. These two two seem like the ones best poised for growth in the CDN space. This is based off of industry exposure and chatting with people who work in DevOps.

11. $DOCU. people aren't going to office to sign stuff, super easy to use, I like their product. 

12. $WMT. eComm, streaming, and a very substantial engineering investment makes me think they have room to grow. Also I really need to diversify. 

13. $COST. When is the last time you heard someone say ""Man I hate going to Costco and paying $1.50 for a hotdog and soda?"" Diversification. Also cheap hotdogs.

14. $NVDA/AMD. GPUs are the present and the future. Not only are they used for video games, but Machine Learning now uses GPU instead of CPU to do compute (Tensorflow for example). Crypto is still a thing as well, and there will always been a constant need for GPUs.

Mutual funds/ETFs
1. $FSCSX. MF which focuses on FinTech. 

2. $VTSAX Pretty much moves with the SP500. 

3. $WCLD. Holdings include Salesforce, Workday, Zuora, Atlassian, Okta, New Relic, Fastly... 

Titanvest:
I was an early access user, and I was able to secure 0% fees for my accout. 36% gains so far. I like them, because their portfolio happens to include shares of tech giants that I either don't have individual stocks for or my stake is low (CRM, PPYL). It nicely complements my existing portfolio.

#Some things I do that that are against the grain:

- Not really diversified. 80% is in tech. They are in very different sectors of tech, but the truth is, when tech falls, all of these companies fall. I'm obviously long tech and I do not believe that tech will fall anytime soon. What about the dot com bubble? There wasn't a single dot com company that was integral in our lives. The internet was in its infancy then. Techonology is now such an interwoven part of our lives and I see companies like Apple, Amazon, Google to be sticking around for several generations.

- I don't read investing articles. I think people who write articles about a stock all have ulterior motives-- to pump or to dump. Case in point-- Citron Research spent years writing articles telling people how SHOP was overvalued. Why did they do that? Because they were shorters at the time. I turned 5k into 27k, because I held on to most of my SHOP shares.

- I don't take much value from balance sheets, other than net loss, income, YoY growth. Instead, I use my business acumen to try to pick up on info that isn't super apparent from Google. For example, one thing I always do is that I look at the career page to see how the business is growing. Increase on marketing/sales/implementation engineers is typically a solid sign that a company is preparing headcount to take new deals in the upcoming quarters. I look at the product road map, supported integrations, and customer base. 

One example was how I applied the above principle was to WalMart. In 2018 I noticed that I was getting targeted by a lot of Data engineering job listing for WalMartLabs-- WarMart's tech division. The role was to build out a big data pipeline to support their eCommerce platform. WalMart's online store released in Q3 of 2019. Post COVID, I used their online store and it was a seamless experience. They even offer a 5% cash back card like Amazon. They reported strong Q4 sales last year, and they did very well post COVID. Why did I choose to invest in $WMT? Because I believe that Wal-Mart has room to grow for their online platform. 

Lastly... remember that wealth isn't accrued over time. It takes years to build. The quickest way to increase your wealth is by investing in yourself-- your career and earning potential. The sooner my income increased, the quicker I had more capital to buy into stocks. 

Also, if you've gotten this far, the point of my post isn't to say that you should invest into tech. The message I'm trying to get across is-- when picking companies, pick companies in fields or verticals you have good knowledge in. Heed Buffet's advice to only pick companies you believe in and understand. Play to your strengths, don't mindless toss money based on one person's posts on Reddit-- always do your own due diligence. Use DD as a guide and use personal research and experience to drive your decision.",2171,0.84

2020-12-21 01:42:00,Tesla To Account For 1.69% Of S&P 500 In Its Debut Today,"Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) will make up for 1.69% of the S&P 500 index as it makes its debut on Monday’s open, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices analyst Howard Silverblatt.

What Happened: Silverblatt said S&P 500’s price-earnings ratio for the coming year will increase from 22.3 to 22.6 with the electric vehicle maker’s addition, CNBC reported Sunday. For every $11.1 Tesla moves, the S&P 500 will fluctuate by one point, as per the analyst.

S&P 500’s dividend yield will dip from 1.56% to 1.53%, Silverblatt said in a note, as per CNBC.

Why It Matters: Tesla will become the fifth largest constituent of the S&P 500 on Monday with the 1.69% weighting.

See Also: Tesla's Valuation Is Greater Than Nearly The Entire Established Auto Industry

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) leads the charts with 6.47%, according to Silverblatt. Other companies ahead of the Elon Musk-led automaker include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT),Amazon .com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB).

Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Class A and Class C shares have 1.66% and 1.61% weighting, respectively.

Goldman Sachs analysts last week said Tesla’s addition to S&P 500 will not make the index more expensive, noting that the aggregate index P/E multiple of S&P 500 will be lifted by slightly less than 1.5% on the EV maker’s inclusion.

2018-11-01 09:31:36,Why do people feel so comfortable holding FB long-term?,"More than willing to accept I'm wrong on this, and if it isn't obvious, I am pretty biased against FB because I personally hate the company, but I'd like to keep this discussion objective.

I don't see how people think Facebook will stay relevant long-term.

Other big tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have an established product/service that would be very hard to recreate. Its unlikely that a college kid could re-invent the Google Search algorithm/write a phone OS like android. Or set up a massive logistics infrastructure like Amazon has. Or make a similar product to Windows or Azure.

Facebook, on the other hand, is a fancy, glorified web forum. There are probably thousands of clones that would work the same or better if all Facebook users migrated over. Why is everyone on Facebook? For most people, the answer is simply ""because everyone else is"". They were the first ""grown-up"" social media site, and that's why they ended up with all the users. 

So what do they bring to the table? A clunky forum-like service. Its true value is the userbase, and they would be nothing without it. If I presented an objectively better version of facebook that cared about your privacy and had no ads called myfriendpals.com and said you should switch over, would you? No because all your friends and family are on Facebook. I wouldn't switch over either.

Now you'd think Facebook would try to treat their users well to encourage them to stay for a long time, but they are constantly in the news being caught fucking them over one way or another to squeeze every bit of possible short-term profit out. The platform is so full of ads and spam that the content you actually logged on to see is buried. Facebook has stopped caring about pleasing its userbase. Its working out for them now, but will it always? I've never met a Facebook fanboy. Everyone uses it because they ""have to"".

If a new platform actually finds a way to get a chunk of Facebook users to bother switching over, it will snowball and people will start leaving Facebook at an exponential rate.

I know they have bought out other popular companies, and facebook.com isn't their only source of revenue, but same deal with Instagram. Its a simple platform that doesn't really bring much to the table except the other users which could leave at any time.

2020-11-29 15:39:47,"I draw with crayons so you don't have to. Last week I closed up $2,250 or 2.8%. Here's what's on the watchlist this week: CRM, TDOC, PTON, FSLY, PRPL, GME, RKT, GPS","I'm back r/stocks with my plays this week. Last week I closed out half my positions and left a few on the table waiting for them to hit my targets. Since I still have some of my positions open from last week I made my watchlist longer for this week to keep an eye out on plays that become within my level. I've also had a lot of DMs asking for plays that can be used on a smaller account so I've included some tickers that require less capital to sell cash-secured-puts. These are simply positions I might be entering based on my own due diligence and analysis.

&#x200B;

**What am I doing?**

I do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 1 to 4 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own. As a backstory I nearly blew up my account doing WSB-style plays in March but have regained all of my account and then some running this strategy since April. What I do now is basically wheeling on weekly puts.

I watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays & levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.

# Here's a few things regarding my strategy

**1.** I don't over-leverage with spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see selling multiple spreads as a ""Theta Gang"" play and is still very high risk. If I do open a spread it will be a protective put for $1-5 just to protect myself should the company randomly announce bankruptcy.

**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.

**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.

**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads, only put-selling and shares!

Honestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.

# Open Positions From Last Week

**FB:** 1x 18 Dec, 2020 $260 put sold to open. Up 50% on this option I sold, looking to sell early this week if we get a good pop and close it out at 60-70%.

**MSFT:** Holding 100 shares. Up 1.75% on the position. Stock sitting at $215, my short-term price target is around $218-220 before I look into selling the position.

**NVDA:** 30 shares. Up 0.24% on the position. Looking for $550 here.

**PTON:** 1x 11 Dec 2020 $101 put sold to open. Up 25% here will look to close at around 50-70% profit range.

# Chart Rules

**Pink Lines** = Trading range & channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.

**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.

# Master Plays This Week (Stock price in parenthesis)

**CRM Salesforce ($248) - Earnings theta yolo**

[CRM CHART](https://imgur.com/uTjMgNF)

CRM has been the powerhouse is customer relations management throughout covid. High quality product that is converting more and more businesses into clients. Earnings are coming up this week so premiums will be juicy. The stock has been consolidating in a volatile range for about 2 months now. Uptrend still intact and close to the $240 support level where we will find some buyers. I'll be looking to enter a position here.

**Positions I'm watching:**

**1.** 1x Dec 11 2020, $240 strike put, sold to open for $7.60 or $760 premium. Return: 3% in 2 weeks. \*I'm selling the 0.33 delta put here. You can go to a lower strike and lower delta, maybe even $235 here and still get decent return.

**2.** Shares with PT to $280.

**TDOC Teladoc ($196)**

[TDOC CHART](https://imgur.com/NC6WSKs)

I entered TDOC a couple weeks ago and made a quick 2-3% return on my play in just 2 or 3 days after the stock price shot up. It's trading a little higher than when I entered my position last time, but still near the bottom of the trend channel (pink lines). I think anything close to $190 is a good entry point. I'll be keeping an on it and look to sell a 0.30 delta put option 4 weeks out if the timing is right.

**Positions I'm watching:**

**1.** 1x Dec 24 2020, $185 strike put, sold to open for $7.00 or $700 premium. Return: 3.7% in 4 weeks.

**2.** Shares with PT to $210-$215

**PTON Peloton ($109)**

[PTON CHART](https://imgur.com/Rl0L7pJ)

I already have a position in PTON open. I sold a put when it was down 6% in a single day last week. I think anywhere sub-$100 level there will be buying pressure to keep it up. When it broke out to $140 it quickly reversed back to the mean stock price and into the channel. Weird how that works ;) Looking at the chart would you buy the stock when it the stock price was going vertically up from $100 to $140? I try to avoid buying on vertical lines unless it's a vertical line down on a stock ticker I like. The trend is still up here even though it has wild swings. Eventually this ticker will lose it's juicy premiums when volatility goes down. I'll try to capture some theta in the mean time.

**Positions I'm watching:**

**1.** 1x Dec 24 2020, $101 strike put, sold to open for $4.45 or $445 premium. Return: 4.4% in 4 weeks.

**2.** Shares with PT back to $120.

**FSLY Fastly ($85)**

[FSLY CHART](https://imgur.com/x0QFpVj)

FSLY also trading in a range approaching that $85 resistance level. It might take off, but if it doesn't I will look to sell a put option around the $78 strike where I think we can find some buyers for the stock. This is another ticker that has volatile swings, but also has been trading steady in a range. Looking at charts like this helps me see where the stock is going and what it is doing. If you look at the daily or intraday you lose sight of these things because it has such wide swings. This will lead you to easily being spooked out of your positions or selling too soon.

**Positions I'm watching:**

**1.** 1x Dec 24 2020, $78 strike put, sold to open for $3.75 or $375 premium. Return: 4.8% in 4 weeks.

**2.** Shares with PT up to $95.

**PRPL Purple Mattress ($30)**

[PRPL CHART](https://imgur.com/ccdQhGV)

PRPL is outside the trend lines and outperforming and also right at the resistance line. Sounds cliche, but the stock will either continue up and outside the range, where I will not touch it, or come back down to the $26-28 range where I will look to sell some puts. IV is still high on this ticker and makes premiums good to sell on. Will need to see where the stock goes this week before any decisions are made.

**Positions I'm watching:**

Waiting for a dip and for the stock price to come back into the channel. Waiting.

**GME Gamestop ($16)**

[GME CHART](https://imgur.com/LjpQ9Ie)

The possibilities where this stock can go are infinite. Premiums sky high. Strong support at $11 and we have some at the $14 range. If we get another up day of 10% tomorrow I won't touch this stock, otherwise I might sell some puts 4-6 weeks out and try to capitalize on the crazy IV this ticker has. This is a higher risk, higher reward play that I am willing to take. Why? Short interest is sky high. When the stock price increases, shorts will cover their losses which will squeeze the stock higher. If the stock price goes down, we will see some dip buyers and also potentially some shorts closing positions for break-even.

**Positions I'm watching:**

**1.** I will look to sell puts at an appropriate strike when the time comes. If the stock is up 10% Monday I won't chase it.

# Long-term holds I am watching

PLTR (Palantir) and AAPL (Apple Inc). Unfortunately AAPL has terrible premiums so I can't collect any theta on it, but I do like the pricing point going into the holidays. Some of the main tech stocks have been under-performing for some time. I think there is a good opportunity to get some before they begin to take-off again.

2021-02-28 00:01:35,How does Actively Managed ETF get money to buy stocks?,"I'm having trouble comprehending how Actively Managed ETFs work, with regards to getting money to make investment decisions. Did some sleuthing on Google, but none of the resources I found adequately explain the process. Appreciate the help!

Please correct my understanding if the following is out of touch with reality.

&#x200B;

For a passively managed ETF, I believe the following is accurate.

Let's say, for example, AWESOMEETF, a passive ETF. For simplicity, the fund currently only have 1 outstanding share, and holds the following securities:

 \- AAPL $100 - 1 share - 50% weight

 \- GOOG $10  - 10 shares - 50% weight

 Total Net Assets is $200

Net Asset Value of the fund found to be $200 / share

Starting Market Price of Fund is $200 / share

&#x200B;

Three scenarios:

1. If there is a buyer wanting 1 share, and the seller is willing to sell it to him, then the shares just exchanges hands. There's no change in the fund holdings.

&#x200B;

2. If there is a buyer wanting 1 share, and the seller is NOT willing to sell. That means the share would trade at a premium to the NAV, let's say $210. This is when the authorized participant (AP) steps in and creates a share by assembling a basket of AAPL/GOOG shares. He would purchase 1 share of AAPL, and 10 shares of GOOG, and deliver that to AWESOMEETF. AWESOMEETF in turn will issue 1 share of the fund. The AP spent $200 and sold the share to our buyer at $210.

 \- AAPL $100 - 2 share - 50% weight

 \- GOOG $10  - 20 shares - 50% weight

Total Net Assets is $400

Net Asset Value of the fund is $200 / share

&#x200B;

3. If our buyer had a change of heart and want to get rid of his 1 share, and we do not have any buyer willing to step in to take his share. That means the share would trade at a discount to the NAV, let's say $190. The AP would step in, buy the share from our paper handed person, redeem it against AWESOMEETF, and get 1 share of AAPL and 10 shares of GOOG. He can then sell at market price for $200, and make $10 from the transaction.

 \- AAPL $100 - 1 share - 50% weight

 \- GOOG $10  - 10 shares - 50% weight

Total Net Assets is $200

Net Asset Value of the fund is $200 / share

&#x200B;

I think I understand how fees are handled. Fees for the fund, such as management fee, trading costs, salary, and whatever, would be deducted from the Total Net Assets, and would thus reduce Market Price/share. This creates a discount of Market Price/share to NAV/share for the basket of stock. Thus, the trusty AP steps in again and redeem some fund shares for a basket of stock to bring Market the NAV / share back to Market Price/share.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Now, let's say AWESOMEETF is now an Actively Managed ETF.

1. What I do not grasp is how AWESOMEETF gets money to buy another stock. Since the AP only ever deliver and redeem shares, the portfolio manager never sees cash. Does that mean if the portfolio manager wants to buy some FB, then the only way to get the funds would be by selling a portion of AAPL or AME?

&#x200B;

2. If let's say that is indeed the case. If the portfolio manager sells 5 shares of GOOG to buy 1 share of FB. Our fund breakdown would be:

 \- AAPL  $100 - 1 share  - 50% weight

 \- GOOG  $10  - 5 shares - 25% weight

 \- FB $20  - 1 share  - 10% weight

 \- cash $30             - 15% weight

Ignoring transaction costs, the Total Net Assets is still $200

2020-11-19 10:44:22,"Facebook, Apple and Other Big Tech Stocks Aren’t Too Expensive. Here’s Why.","Tech stocks have soared this year as the pandemic rapidly shifted people to remote work and school. Still, according to strategists at Goldman Sachs, the five largest U.S. tech companies actually aren’t overvalued.

First off, these stocks—Facebook ￼ (ticker: FB), Apple ￼ (AAPL), Amazon ￼ (AMZN) Alphabet (GOOGL), and Microsoft ￼ (MSFT)—are up about 49% year-to-date on average. In comparison, the S&P 500 is up just under 12% for the year. Before Sept. 2, these five stocks had an average multiple on the next two years of earnings of roughly 35 times, against 12 times for the other 495 stocks on the S&P 500, according to Goldman Sachs data. That was the widest valuation gap between the group and the broader market since 2000—before the tech bubble burst.

Lately, investors have taken note of the drastic surge in the five stocks’ valuations. Since September 2, the group is down about 3% on average. Meanwhile, large-cap value stocks, judging by the Vanguard S&P 500 Value ETF (VOOV), have climbed 5.2%. Now, the so-called FAAMG group is trading at roughly 31 times earnings, compared with 20 times for the other 495 stocks.

Many on Wall Street are wary of big tech as these multiples would seem bound to continue falling after their meteoric rise this year, and as interest rates rise when the economy starts to see a more solid recovery. Tech stocks, after all, would see less of a benefit from a firming economy. Mostly, growth stocks such as these five tend to have idiosyncratic revenue drivers that aren’t affected by changes in the economy—while the revenues of value stocks like consumer discretionary are very much tied to consumer spending trends and economic growth.

Evercore strategists recently said they only see S&P 500 gains of roughly 5% in the next year or so because they don’t expect big tech to outperform the way it has in recent history.

But David Kostin, Goldman Sachs’ chief US equity strategist, argues in a note that “fundamentals support higher valuation for FAAMG.”

Kostin noted that the near-term earnings outlook for FAAMG stocks supports the current valuations. Goldman is looking for S&P 500 companies to post a median annual earnings per share growth of 8% for the next few years. The tech group is expected to see EPS growth of about 17%.

Comparing these companies’ earnings multiples to their near-term earnings growth rates—which many analysts do to determine how fair a valuation is—further justifies Kostin’s point. Facebook’s PEG ratio—calculated by taking the stock’s forward price-to-earnings ratio and dividing by its projected earnings growth rate—is 1.2 times, roughly in line with in its five-year average of 1.1, according to data from FactSet. Amazon’s PEG ratio is 1.6 times, notably lower than its five-year average of 2.4. Alphabet’s PEG is at 1.9 against an average of 1.5, although its five-year high is above 2. Microsoft’s PEG is 2, in line with its average. Apple is the most overvalued by the metric, with a PEG of 2.6 against an average of 1.5.

With the exception of Apple, these companies are expected to see EPS compound an annual rate between the midteens in percentage terms to above 30%. If investors are willing to pay top dollar for these stocks, earnings growth could continue to take them higher.

All five have dominant platforms that create seemingly endless synergies. Amazon’s new online drug business, for example, offers perks to their roughly 70 million Prime members. This can drive adoption of the new offering, but can also drive new prime customers.

The point is tech stocks are pricey for good reason—don’t count them out.

Bullish on these tickers but given the number of positions in the portfolio I only have a cursory understanding of those businesses so I'm trying to trim the number of stocks I own - going for quality over quantity.

Are these too speculative given I don't have ETFs?

2020-10-30 13:08:07,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, October 30, 2020. What a crazy day, hope this helps a bit :)","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 30, 2020**

The stock market fell sharply today, erasing yesterday’s gains to close out one of the worst weeks and worst month since March. Volatility has dominated markets in the last few weeks, with investors spooked by the uncertainty of the US presidential elections, a record number of coronavirus infections in the US and Europe, and a new wave of lockdowns across Europe.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) performed the worst, ended the day 2.54% down, the S&P 500 (SPY) ended the day 1% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) 0.52% down.

Yesterday after-hours, heavily-weighted tech companies, like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Facebook (FB) reported their quarterly earnings. Though most reported third-quarter results that exceeded expectations, shares of these companies (except Alphabet) pulled back steeply today. After the strong performance of these stocks compared to the broader market this year, market participants had set their expectations exceptionally high. In other words, traders expected these companies to beat expectations by a much greater margin than they did. The earnings results for all these companies can be found in yesterday’s issue of the daily recap. 

Today, the Federal Reserve announced it lowered the minimum loan size for its Main Street lending program to $100,000 from $250,000 and that “fees have been adjusted to encourage the provision of these smaller loans”. Demand for the lending program has been weak thus far, with the Fed having offered just 400 loans totaling $3.7 billion, out of the total $600 billion capacity. As many pundits have pointed out, many small- and mid-sized businesses have stayed on the sidelines from taking on more loans that they would eventually need to pay back during the pandemic.

Unfortunately, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, there were 88,521 new coronavirus infections reported in the US yesterday, another record, and 9,540 more cases than were reported Wednesday. The trend this week is worrying, given that only last Friday, the US set its previous record for daily new infections. According to the Washington Post, The total number of infections reported nationwide since February is virtually guaranteed to reach 9 million on Friday, just 15 days after the tally hit 8 million. At least 228,000 deaths have been linked to the coronavirus in the country.

Europe is in the thralls of a second surge in coronavirus, with the continent now accounting for 46% of global cases and nearly a third of total deaths. According to World Health Organization (WHO) Spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris, compared to last week, daily cases in Europe have risen by “about a third” and daily deaths by “close to 40%” this week. This month, both France and Spain have declared states of emergency, imposing more restrictions to try to ease up pressure on hospital ICU departments. In France, the worst-hit country, more than half of ICU beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, according to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.

Today is the last Friday before the US presidential election on Tuesday. Regardless of political leanings, the results of this election are sure to have a massive effect on the stock market, it’ll be interesting to see how markets react to whatever the US decides.

2020-12-10 05:24:12,"Selling DoorDash after IPO? | AirBNB IPO NEXT | LULU, ADBE, COST, PLAY STOCK EARNINGS | STOCK MARKET NEWS [12-10]","**DoorDash just went public in a crazy overvalued IPO, AirBNB will follow today. Today we get earnings from Lululemon, Adobe, Dave & Busters, Costco & more. Let’s talk about this and everything about the stock market**

Hey everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/bzmy8C4) drop almost 2% and suffering its biggest loss since October after the 4-day win streak, the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Kw3DKxD) also dropped .80% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/9GvPGh5) did much better, down just .35% for the day. We saw a huge spike in the volatility [index](https://ibb.co/RcShWPM) of over 7% closing at the highest level since the 23rd of November.

We saw more companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/YkqyTgh) as finally some stocks have started to move below the moving averages on about average volume for the day.

We saw most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/Wfn4Trj) in the red yesterday as Tech and Communications suffered the most dropping more than 1% for the day, with small gains being made in just the Industrials, Energy and Materials sectors as Growth companies suffered the most [yesterday](https://ibb.co/5hQKP88), especially the Large-Caps as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/V9bfV71), with all the big FAANG names and other big tech companies being deep in the red as Apple, Amazon, and Netflix dropped more than 2% for the day, while FB, Google and Microsoft also lost over 1%, but the big loser yesterday was Tesla losing 7% for the day.

Today we will get some critical economic [data](https://ibb.co/qnkdTJz), and if this disappoints, we might see another big drop in the stock market, as the jobless claims will start us off in the early morning.

Alongside this economic data, today the [FDA](https://ibb.co/0906d6L) may approve the emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine, that could lead to a vaccine rollout starting next week. This might help the markets have a more positive reaction if the FDA grants the authorization.

One good thing in my opinion is that the most recent [survey](https://ibb.co/5WPhj8B) from the AAII showed a slight decrease in Bullish and Neutral investors while the Bearish camp gained more than 4% in the last week.

Investors had gotten very bullish in the last weeks and this usually is a contrarian indicator, so seeing this small drop is a good thing to see, as I want more and more people to start feeling bearish so I can find and buy stocks at more attractive prices than the current ones. So, the more bearish people get, the more I like to get on and buy stocks. But still… there is to much of a concentration in the bull’s camp so we might have to wait a little, for more fear to appear in the stock market.

Positive indicators also popped up yesterday as Wholesale [invetories](https://ibb.co/WxPPLpS) rose more than expected in October, as this led the Atlanta FED to maintain they’re Q4 GDP [estimates](https://ibb.co/SBZPtZP), while [Goldman](https://ibb.co/sQ42gCg) also thinks the economy will recover faster than expected starting with Q4 and going on next year.

While on the jobs front, October job opening came in [better](https://ibb.co/4VdrTbQ) than expected at over 6,6M, as the job opening rate stood at 6,7% while the quits rate at just 2,2%.

So, DoorDash went live [yesterday](https://ibb.co/LJtbPtH) at 182$ which is insane in my opinion, the current price gives the company a [valuation](https://ibb.co/kcBcpYW) of over $70B, more than 4 times what the company raised at the last private fundraising six months ago. This valuation is higher than Chipotle, Yum Brands, Domino’s and many others from the food industry.

And by the way, don’t forget the stock is [trading](https://ibb.co/CP0Qgbr) at over 30 times sales of this year, which were hugely boosted by the current situation, and that food delivery is really hard for any company, especially one that expects to grow to have a share of more than 50% of the entire world in the sector so that it can justify the current valuation.

One of the biggest gainers from this is SoftBank as they have a big stake in the company. The shares of SoftBank [skyrocketed](https://ibb.co/GnTSqJf) yesterday to new highs in almost two decades. Like almost every time, the biggest gainers in this IPOs are the banks and not us the retail investors.

With the other big [IPO](https://ibb.co/Ld0pMdz) yesterday being C3.ai which also opened way above the IPO price, as investors can’t get enough of this stock’s, I don’t think this is a healthy hype for this type of IPOs, investors expect every new company to just skyrocket but, not all of them will, and paying such a high premium is not worth it most time, better wait for a pullback before getting some action on these stocks.

Today we will see [AirBNB](https://ibb.co/Hxd70Tb) go public, as the valuation for this company also gets higher and higher, as they have started selling shares for 68$ even higher than the latest targeted price between 56-60$. And if DoorDash is any [indication](https://ibb.co/8cb3yTs), I don’t think we will be able to get our hands on this stock below 100$. Way above my 70-80$ max price that I am willing to pay, so I am going to wait this out also until they have a pullback, maybe once the first earnings come out, that will be the case. But if somehow the IPO is under 80$ and especially under 70$ I would be willing to get some action.

Some other [news](https://ibb.co/H4Pxqmq) from the stock market which pushed companies like Facebook lower came in when almost every US state filed a lawsuit against the company. In the long run, if this happens just like with the Google lawsuit, the sum of the parts of the company is bigger than the company itself, so I don’t really have any worries long-term about Facebook or Google, as they are the 2 of the biggest advertising platforms in the world.

While [REAL ESTATE](https://ibb.co/0X85Cb4) is starting to make a small comeback in New York, as leases jumped 30% year over year in November to around 4000 new ones, but it will still take a very long time before things go back to where they stood before this year.

Also, we will have a lot of earnings results today as [Oracle](https://ibb.co/jb5CPPV), Lululemon, Adobe, Dave & Busters, Costco, Broadcom and others report.

I expect [Lululemon](https://ibb.co/J2MBWD2) to beat the estimates and the stock to regain momentum after it has struggled since the beginning of September. And just like analysts from Raymond James [said](https://ibb.co/gFL3T0s), the only underlying story problem for investors it’s the valuation, but this will soon go away, as people will buy this brand even more once the reopening begins.

Likewise, [Dave & Buster's](https://ibb.co/L0rY2YS) may have smaller loses than expected last quarter as restaurants weren’t hit so badly like before or like this quarter.

While [BROADCOM](https://ibb.co/b5kYKLB) stands to benefit a lot from the recent move in semiconductor industry especially for data centers that stands to benefit them a lot.

[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/D19qrSc) will also report earnings after the close, and is expected to show over 14% growth in eps and revenues since last year, as they are one of the best retailers to own as a shareholder, even if they always trade at a premium.

Adobe just released earnings while writing this post and here are the excelent results that the company [posted](https://ibb.co/kyzBLjv). Now let's see how the stock reacts, will it go down or up?

So, guys, don’t forget not to panic sell when you see a big red day in the markets, just look at this Wells Fargo [chart](https://ibb.co/yQwKpt0).

Investors who added 30% more exposure to equities, and took the money from investment-grade fixed income largely outperform the rest of the investors, while the average investor who does a quarterly rebalancing also did very good and is still up over 10% for the year, while investors who reduced the equity exposure by 50% and put that money into fixed income or kept it in cash are up just 2%. With by far the worst results seen in investors who removed all of the exposure to equities, they are down 6% for the year.

Just be patient, trust the companies that you like and keep investing every time you can. In the long-run markets will always go UP & UP.

2021-01-06 00:32:32,Facebook vs Apple: What's the endgame?,"Ok, seriously what's the end result here, re: iOS14?

Quite frankly, for all the shit FB gets these days for seemingly being The absolute end all be all epitome of evil; the simple fact is nothing in life is free. Facebook makes money off of selling your data for ads. In exchange, you get unparalleled internet access and connectivity across the globe, for no out of pocket costs.

Meanwhile, for a similar level of experience through Apple, you have to pay Apple a considerable amount out of pocket. Ok. Fine.

I feel like there's room for both approaches. I just dont get why Facebook has to be so vilified when they""re providing a quality product for free. Yes, they track your data in exchange for targeted ads...in order to continue providing a service for no out-of-pocket costs to the user (which, believe it or not, out-of-pocket costs are kind of a big deal if you don't make a lot of money).

Moderna just announced a new vaccine, what does this mean for the stock market? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news** [BANNER](https://ibb.co/GMCv9B1)

Hey everyone and Welcome, so let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw all 3 big indices in the green with a late push to end the day. The dow was the biggest gainer up 1,6% and also posted a new record close just shy of the 30k mark [CHART](https://ibb.co/NrF0HWc) ,while the broader SP500 trailed a little the whole day and finished up 1,17%  [CHART](https://ibb.co/xhkQWnk) while even the tech heavy Nasdaq finished in the green after a slow start to the day on the Moderna vaccine news with a late push to end up 0,8% [CHART](https://ibb.co/tcGnChD). The VIX continued to decline to it lowest levels since august as it continues to slowly trend to it’s pre-shutdown levels [CHART](https://ibb.co/Wfy5Kg6). Almost all sectors [CHART](https://ibb.co/hLY6Fzx) were in the green yesterday as a repeat of last Monday happened with Energy, Industrials and Financials having a good boost from the Moderna news with over 3 quarters of the companies advancing and 141 of them making new highs [CHART](https://ibb.co/qMjmtwf), the average volume return to normal, as there was not such a big transition in portfolios like a week ago. The rally was mostly pushed by small cap and value plays as even the Russel 2000 made new highs after this news. [CHART](https://ibb.co/PQb0kJw)

This is the HEAT map from yesterday and as you can see, most of the companies gained, except the ones from Health Care, where all of the money rushed to Moderna [CHART](https://ibb.co/3YkLfw8), but I believe this is a great misjudgment for investors, as there is not a lot of money to be made on this vaccine, and this is the only product they offer at the moment, so I don’t think it really deserves the 100$ price range in which it has traded yesterday. I don’t like this stock at all at this point, if you do want to play the vaccine news and profits you should look at other companies that will help distribute it like CVS, Walgreens, McKesson, Costco, Walmart and others.

Before the open today we will here from Walmart and Home depot which release earnings reports, this is also followed by economic reports like retail sales, business inventories and some other interesting events that are due later. [EVENTS](https://ibb.co/WfzJdMk) [BEFORE OPEN](https://ibb.co/WvKW8hn)

So, let’s talk about what the vaccine news were yesterday as Moderna  [NEWS](https://ibb.co/52fSmF4) announced a vaccine that has an even better efficiency than Pfizer’s at over 94% and also doesn’t require such extreme temperatures to be stored and transported, Pfizer required under -80 degrees Celsius while Moderna is stable up to 6 months at only -20 degrees Celsius or even at 2-8 degrees Celsius for up to 30days. So, there is expectation that both Moderna and Pfizer will file for the FDA emergency use authorization very soon. Both will require 2 shots for the vaccine to be effective almost a month apart. This will also be followed in the next few months with results from AstraZeneca and JNJ so the more vaccines that are available the faster the pandemic will end, but I wouldn’t rush out of the tech names that have brought the market here, they are here to stay even after this all ends. The world didn’t just run into tech companies because of the pandemic, the world was already going there but this was only accelerated by this, and I don’t see companies that don’t need to going back to the way it was, because this has brought better margin profits for many companies as there are fewer expenses with the work from home environment.

So in my opinion The markets are likely going to keep it up, as I don’t see a crash or a pullback soon as there are a lot more positives then negatives for the stock market. The only negative is that the reopening is not happening yet, but that will come next year, while there are a lot of positives like better treatments, the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines and probably more to come, a probably divided congress which is good news for not many changes that affect the stock market [MARKET GAIN](https://ibb.co/yXB5Mpy), the ultra-low interest rates that are here to stay for a while as the Fed will keep the economy going and a probable stimulus that will come eventually.  [LIQUIDITY](https://ibb.co/6wx3gBz)

There are a lot of things that drives stocks higher like very good earnings [EARNINGS CHART](https://ibb.co/hXCwZGD) from most of the companies that I really think will continue to be very good and even get better in the next years as more money will be put into the economy by the fed and eventually by the consumers also the companies are starting to pay dividends again and there is a lot of money still on the sidelines that can come back in the stock market. [https://ibb.co/yXB5Mpy](https://ibb.co/yXB5Mpy)

This year is the second time that ETF’s have had a more than 400 billion dollars of inflow and that will likely keep going up, as investors are leaving low rate bonds and taking on more risk with equities as the US total assets under management are up over 5 Trillion $.  [INTEREST RATES](https://ibb.co/8KCWtqr)

Meanwhile after the close yesterday, it was announced that Tesla will finally be included in the SP500 on the 21st of December this year. This is after the company has had a longer path of profitability with 5 straight quarters of profit even with the pandemic ranging on. This will probably lead to a higher demand for the stock as index funds will need to buy the stock. [CHART](https://ibb.co/9ZL7wJC)

As you can see people have turned around opinions on the company as the short interest has plummeted from over 200 million shares to below 50 million shores in less than 2 years. That is a decrease of over 70% in just 12 months. [CHART](https://ibb.co/frL3ZGT)

Tesla has become the largest ever company to be added to the SP500, and will likely replace one of the bottom companies from the oil industry in the index. The company will have a 1% weight in the SP as the committee estimates the funding for the trade will need over 50 billion dollars, one of the largest in the SP History. The stock traded as much as 525 intra-day before dropping to below 400 after they were not included in the SP500 last go around [CHART](https://ibb.co/m5NxHGB). Even more actively managed funds that try to beat the SP will be forced to decide if they buy Tesla shares or not, as the company may give them a downside risk due to its high potential of growth, such funds manage trillions of dollars that could also pour into the stock. 

And With factories ramping up like Shanghai which will produce 1million vehicles, Freemont as well, and with Austin and Berlin factories expected to produce at least 500k, they will likely be able to produce over 2 million cars in 2022 or 2023, which is a great increase from around 600thousand/year capacity at the moment. [FACTORIES](https://ibb.co/DWWXWQK)

The stock has surged after hours more than 13% to around 460$ but I really like the company, and I believe the stock can go higher in the long term especially, I have a price target of just over 600$ for tesla, but we can see a re-test of the 500$ level very soon in the stock, with the EV push that is expected to come in the next years.  [TESLA NEWS](https://ibb.co/yXGxzFb) [TESLA NEWS](https://ibb.co/Qdt07QR)

One other big thing to follow today after the close is what NIO reports as the company has been targeted by short sellers recently and saw the stock drop from its highs over 50$ to barely 40$ in the span of a couple of days but has since recovered as a lot of people are very optimistic of the earnings report. The company is expected to lose around 17 cents per shares and have a revenue of over 600 million dollars, double the revenue that the company had a year ago. The stock has not beaten the estimates of earnings yet in the last 2 years, so this will be very good if the company finally manages to do that. [NIO](https://ibb.co/1R0bSXm)

Also, after the close, COSTCO announced a special dividend for shareholders of 10$ as they continue to be one of the greatest companies to own, as management has constantly taken care of shareholders with great dividends and great growth for the company. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/hKbnFpQ)

One other interesting news came from Nvidia which release a huge product, as the company release a new GPU with more than 80 gigabytes of memory, doubling the old model, this are huge performance numbers that are required in the new world of cloud computing. [NVIDIA NEWS](https://ibb.co/bX60cqv)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 25th, 2021.

# **Apple and Tesla earnings, along with the Fed and GDP will drive markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/22/apple-and-tesla-earnings-vaccine-news-and-the-fed-will-be-focus-of-markets-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Stimulus euphoria may be waning, but investors will have plenty to focus on in the week ahead, as a blast of earnings news hits, the Federal Reserve meets and new data will show the state of the economy at the end of the year.
*****
> Stocks gained in the past week on optimism for a $1.9 trillion stimulus package, proposed by President Joe Biden. But by Friday, the market lost steam amid increased concerns about the pandemic’s economic impact, and as it seemed Biden would not have an easy time getting the stimulus plan approved.
*****
> Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Tesla and more than 100 other S&P 500 companies report earnings in the biggest rush of earnings reports this quarter.
*****
> The pandemic will also be a factor as travel restrictions and lockdowns threaten the global economy, and worries remain over the speed of vaccine distributions.
*****
> But there is hope that Johnson and Johnson will release positive news on its vaccine results soon, and if that’s the case it could signal another source of vaccines will be available. The J&J vaccine would be a single shot, as opposed to the currently available double-shot vaccines.
*****
> “We expect to see their results,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “That could be super bullish.” The company reports earnings on Tuesday.
*****
> Hogan said the market may also respond to Covid news. He said the seven-day average in new Covid cases fell below the 14-day average this past week for the first time since Thanksgiving, and if that continues, it could indicate a peak.
*****
> If the virus news improves, the market could resume its grind higher in the coming week, said Hogan.
*****
> # Economy
> As for the economy, the first look at fourth quarter real gross domestic product comes Thursday, and it is expected to show growth of 4.7%, according to the CNBC/Moody’s Analytics Rapid Update survey. For the year, the economists surveyed expect GDP contracted by 3.5%. The economists forecast 5% growth for 2021.
*****
> Consumers pulled back at the end of the fourth quarter, evidenced by a surprise 0.7% decline in December retail sales reported this past week, after a negative November.
*****
> “You’re really going to see a loss of momentum throughout the quarter,” said Kevin Cummins, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets. “It’s a set up for a really weak Q1.” PMI data shows manufacturing activity has been strong, but labor market data is weak and consumer spending is disappointing.
*****
> “You’ve got to juxtapose what’s happening with the vaccine and the virus with what’s happening with underlying data. We’ve definitely seen a lot of the things that could spark a pullback,” said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equity strategist at RBC.
*****
> Calvasina and other strategists expect a sell-off early in the year.
*****
> Stocks hit new highs across the major indices Wednesday, as Biden was inaugurated, and many technicians see the market as overbought. The catalyst for a pullback is not clear, but strategists expect the market to gain this year and say a buying opportunity would open up with any decline.
*****
> “Do we start to see stuff showing up in that data that makes us question that recovery?” said Calvasina. “My assumption is we’re going to get a lot of volatility in that data, and we’re going to get some downdrafts but it’s not going to be bad enough to erase this upward trajectory we’ve seen in the economy since the second quarter.”
*****
> # Fed ahead
The Fed is also a powerful backstop for the market, and economists don’t expect the Fed to take any action or change in its dovish tone when it releases its statement Wednesday afternoon, following its two-day meeting.
*****
> “I don’t see them making many changes,” said Cummins of NatWest. “They’ll probably acknowledge just the fact that employment was weak.
*****
> “It’s going to be pretty clear cut,” he added. “I think Powell will sound similar to what he sounded like in September.” Cummins said the Fed chairman is likely to say the economic outlook depends on the course of the virus and vaccine.
*****
> There is also durable goods data Wednesday and personal income and spending data on Friday. The Fed’s favorite inflation gauge, the PCE deflator is also released Friday, and Powell will surely be asked Wednesday afternoon about inflation, which is increasingly being priced into market expectations.
*****
> Powell is also likely to be asked his views on fiscal stimulus, which could end up being smaller than some expect.
*****
> Hogan of National Securities said the market traded lower on Friday on expectations the package could be smaller and take longer than expected to gain approval.
*****
> “I think the realism of saying $1.9 trillion and doing $1.9 trillion are two different things,” he said. “We fall into that trap all the time.”
*****
> “What’s happening now is there is no magic wand here,” Hogan added. “It’s not to say there’s no stimulus. It’s just a matter of how long it will take and how much there will be. There’s a little bit of realism.”
*****
> Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, said a pullback could be sparked if bitcoin starts to fall more sharply, since some investors would sell stock in response. “When there’s no bid in bitcoin they have to sell something, and they sell stock,” said Maley.
*****
> Bitcoin has had a wild early ride in 2021. The cryptocurrency hit a record high of $41,973 on Jan. 12, according to data from Coin Metrics. Days later, it fell about 15%, wiping out as much as $200 billion in just 24 hours.
*****
> Bitcoin then regained some of its losses, surging to near $40,000 before another reversal. On Friday, it was trading at $33,200 after dipping below $30,000.
*****
> “If this thing starts tanking again, it’s going to cause some forced selling and it’s going to cause some selling in the stock market,” said Maley, adding it will be important to hold the low from Thursday night.
*****
> He said the short position in the dollar is also an overcrowded trade that could turn quickly. A resulting short squeeze could cause a dollar rally that would be negative for the stock market. He also is watching Tesla, which reports earnings on Wednesday.
*****
> “I think whether it be bitcoin, the dollar, Tesla, one of these crowded trades...it’s going to turn the narrative that’s permeating right now, and if we don’t get a surprise the market will continue to push higher,” he said.

> # February Almanac: Worst S&P 500 Month of Post-Election Years

> Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.0% in February since 1979—just the sixth best month for that benchmark.

> February’s post-election year performance since 1950 is miserable, ranking dead last for S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000. Average losses have been sizable: -1.5%, -3.3% and -1.6% respectively. February ranks tenth for DJIA in post-election years with an average loss of 1.1%. February 2001 and 2009 were exceptionally brutal. NASDAQ dropped 22.4% in February 2001, its third worst monthly loss ever.

> # Housing Closes Out 2020 on a Positive Note

> Housing closed out 2020 on an extremely positive note as both Housing Starts and Building Permits topped forecasts by more than 100K. Since 2002, there have only been ten other months where both reports topped forecasts by more than 100K, and today's report was the third time it happened in the last 12 months!

> The table below breaks down the details of the December report in terms of both single and multi-family units and regions. One of the clear areas of strength was in single-family starts and permits. On a y/y basis, both were up over 25%, and relative to November, starts were up 12% while permits rose 7.8%. Multi-family units, meanwhile, both saw declines with notable weakness in multi-family starts. On a regional basis, most areas of the country saw strength although starts and permits were down m/m and y/y in the Northeast.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-Details.png))**

> Given its overall size, you can easily make the case that as goes the housing market, so goes the economy, and history tends to bear this out. The top chart shows the 12-month average of Housing Starts going back to 1967 with recessions overlaid in gray. With the exception of the latest downturn, every prior recession was preceded by a rollover in Housing Starts. Given the sudden onset of the pandemic, housing played no role in the current recession, but once the lockdowns started, the residential housing market wasn't immune to the weakness. Whatever weakness there was didn't last long. As shown in the second chart below, less than a year after the recession started, both the 12-month average of Housing Starts and Building Permits have now moved back above their pre-pandemic highs.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-and-Business-Cycle.png))**
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-and-Business-Cycle-Last-10-Years.png))**

> While Housing Starts and Building Permits are both at new multi-year highs, on a population-adjusted basis, they're still closer to levels typically associated with recessions than expansions. After adjusting for population growth, Housing Starts would need to come in above 1.9 million just to keep up with population growth.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-Population-Adjusted.png))**

> As for the stocks of homebuilders, the performance of the iShares Home Construction ETF (ITB) tends to track trends in Housing Starts and Building Permits pretty closely, so it's no surprise that it also traded to a new all-time high on Thursday for the first time in three months. As long as interest rates don't see a sudden spike higher, trends in place for the residential housing market remain positive.

> # Impressive Reading From The Philly Fed

> Of the several strong economic data points to have been released today, perhaps the strongest relative to expectations was the Philadelphia Fed's monthly survey on the region's manufacturing sector. The headline index was expected to rise from 11.1 to 11.8. Instead, it more than doubled expectations rising to 26.5. That is the highest reading since last February just before the pandemic's full impact was felt. Overall, the report showed the region's manufacturing sector experienced strong growth in January with accelerating growth in demand, prices, and employment.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-HL.png))**

> In the table below, we break down the various sub-indices of the report. Nearly every component experienced a month over month increase that ranks in the top few percentiles of their respective histories. That also left most indices in the top decile of their historic ranges. That compares to last month in which most readings were far more moderate. Although most indices for current conditions saw impressive readings, the indices for expectations were much more mixed with a larger number falling than rising MoM. Given every one of these indices remains positive, though, the region's manufacturers still have an overall optimistic outlook.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Table1.png))**

> Of all the sub-indices, the New Orders index saw one of the most significant increases in January rising 28.1 percentage points from a barely expansionary reading of 1.9 to a much stronger reading of 30. Going back over the past couple of years, the only times this index was higher was in October (32.9) and February (30.7) of last year. That indicates very strong new order growth after a slowdown in December.

> Similarly, the index for unfilled orders was the only index in contractionary territory (those below zero) last month, but there was a massive improvement this month as the index surged to a reading of 25.6. Both the level of the index and the monthly change stand in the top 1% of all readings going back through the history of the survey which began in 1968. The only times the index has been higher was in August of 1972 (26) and January (29.6) and March (45.1) of 1973. In other words, New Orders remain strong while Unfilled Orders are bouncing back at a historic rate.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Orders.png))**

> While the unfilled orders index reached one of the highest readings on record, the index for Delivery Times actually hit a new record. The index rose 12.7 points to a record high of 30; surpassing the previous record of 21.3 from October of 2017. Higher readings in this index indicate that supplier lead times are longer and vice versa for lower readings. That means a historic number of respondents are seeing delays in their supply chains.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Deliveries.png)**

> Perhaps to get ahead of the growing demand and longer lead times, businesses are also reporting higher inventories. That index rose to the highest level since September of 2019 which also stands in the top 5% of all readings in the history of the data.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Inv.png)**

> Given the stronger demand and tighter supply lines, prices have also been accelerating. Both Prices Paid and Prices Received experienced some of their largest monthly increases on record after rising 20.5 points in January. At 45.4, the index for Prices Paid is at its highest level since August of 2018. Those price increases are also getting passed along to customers as the index for Prices Received is at the highest level since February of 1989. These results echo some other hints of more inflationary conditions like the New York Fed's readings last week and the ISM services and manufacturing report earlier this month.

> # Real-time COVID-19 Data Suggests Final Peak May Be Here

> It has been exactly one year since the first COVID-19 case in the United States was reported to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and to say the world as we know it has been completely changed would be an understatement. Thankfully, we may finally be seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.

> With the rollout of multiple approved vaccines underway, some real-time COVID-19 indicators and mobility-related data points have put in their final highs (or lows). As shown in the LPL chart of the day, restrictions implemented at the end of 2020 appear to be helping to curb the spread of the virus, as new COVID-19 cases and those currently hospitalized have been on the decline.

> However, while COVID-19 data has been improving, real-time economic indicators like OpenTable reservations show businesses continue to struggle as restrictions on activities to curb the late-2020 surge remain in place.

> “The good news is that cases are declining and vaccine distribution is increasing, but service industries and air travel are clearly still under a lot of pressure,” said LPL Research Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “While manufacturing and housing data remain firm, recent data on the job market and consumer spending have been choppy.”

> It’s very encouraging to see COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations improving, a trend we hope will continue until this pandemic ends for good. In the meantime, we will continue to follow high-frequency data to gauge the recovery’s progress. The next report card comes next week with the release of fourth quarter 2020 gross domestic product (GDP).

> We’ll also be closely watching developments in Washington, DC. The economy’s bridge to the other side will likely get stronger in the coming weeks with more stimulus—potentially to the tune of another $700 billion to $1 trillion.

2020-12-07 08:00:44,Buying IPOs is stupid - here's why,"So there's often lots of excitement in this sub about hot IPOs and my philosophy is that I usually wait for 6-12 months after the IPO before considering a purchase.  I do that because stocks tend to be very volatile post-IPO, and because I like to see a few quarters of publicly reported financials before deciding if I want to invest.  But I started to get curious about my observations regarding the volatility of stocks after their IPOs, so I decided to conduct a little study.

I looked at some of the largest and most successful IPOs dating all the way back to FB in 2012.  I made a note of the opening trading price on the IPO day as well as the prices 1 month post, 3 months post, 6 months post, 12 months post, and current price.  I included some of 2020's earlier IPOs even though  most of them don't have 6 months of trading yet.  This gave me a sample of 29 IPOs to look at.  All but 2 of them are currently higher than their opening trading price, so it's been a very successful group overall.

**Results:**

10/29 (34.5%) were lower than the IPO price one month later.

6/29 (20.7%) were lower than the IPO price 3 months later.

9/29 (31%) were lower than the IPO price 6 months later.

12/29 (41.4%) were lower than the IPO price 12 months later.

2/29 (6.9%) *never* made a lower low since their IPO.

Two things stand out from this data:

1) There is a clear price pattern in which stocks tend to do better within the first 3 months post IPO but then pull back.  Almost half of them were lower a year later.

2) ALMOST EVERY SINGLE STOCK (27/29) hit a price lower than its IPO price at some point within the first 18 months post IPO (26/27 around the one year mark). 

Now there are a lot of IPOs I didn't include in the study because I wanted to focus on the bigger name stocks to study the phenomenon of buying hot IPOs.  The numbers speak for themselves.  You are much better off waiting a year after an IPO to buy because you will almost always get a better price at some point during that year.",7,0.69

2020-12-27 21:33:27,Contributing to a portfolio monthly,"Can someone help me understand why you would want to create a stock portfolio and contribute by % to each of these stocks on a regular basis vs waiting for a time it’s appropriately priced?

I’ve been trying to get together a list of stocks for a long term portfolio. As I look at them now only a few seem reasonable to contribute to at today’s price.

This same idea is what put me off on some of the popular ETFs as they seem overvalued even if they are incredible stock picks.

I have also heard the idea of slow contributions are better than large ones to mitigate risk.

The NYSE approved the plan for direct IPOs. Should you sell Moderna & buy Boeing? Let’s talk about this and everything about the stock market.**

 **\~Very Long Post\~** 

Hello everyone and Good Morning!  So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the tech heavy [Nasdaq](https://ibb.co/ryVyyKt) up more than 0.5% and closing at a new all-time high, while the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/X31XLDq) finished down 0.21% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/qB2m8Jm) lagged behind, finishing the day with a 200 points loss, its biggest loss in December. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/Qkw3MBK) trending down after that huge spike in volatility on Monday as more than 50% of companies were declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/QXzWV6h) as even more companies continue to move below the 50-day moving average on about average volume. We saw only 2 [sectors](https://ibb.co/cT4Z90m) finishing in the green yesterday (Technology & Real Estate) while the biggest losers were in the Energy, Financial and Communications sectors as small caps continue their outperformance in the past weeks especially growth companies, while large-cap value plays lagged the market on [Tuesday](https://ibb.co/9VGmwtC).

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/34wtTb6) from yesterday, and you can that [Apple](https://ibb.co/dmNdcRy) pushed even higher, gaining almost 3% again after the reports earlier in the week of the company moving towards an EV or Self-Driving Technology play while [Tesla](https://ibb.co/r6d3Zvp) is approaching correction territory very fast as we also saw a lot more companies losing ground with big losers like Alibaba, Chevron, FB and many more.

We also got some economic data numbers yesterday as the consumer [confidence](https://ibb.co/PTT4BbQ) dropped to under 90, way below the 97 levels expected and 92.9 in the previous month. This was a result of a decline in the present situation confidence of the consumers due to the more uncertainty in the cold months. With home [sales](https://ibb.co/9TNmp0B) also falling more than expected but are still more than 25% up from a year ago with price also increasing by more than 14%.

But we did see an [improved](https://ibb.co/VxtKTwR) Q3 GDP revision up 0.3%, with most of the growth coming from [private](https://ibb.co/dcV1HkX) good & services, with 21 of the 22 industry [groups](https://ibb.co/LJDSsLW) contributing as Durable Good and Health Care helped the most, while utilities did almost nothing and mining was a negative for the US Economy.

[Today](https://ibb.co/3cGf7HN) we have tons of economic data coming in, starting with initial and continuing jobless claims, consumer spending, core inflation, consumer sentiment index and many more, this might give the stock market some direction depending on how the data comes in.

So, we saw a stunning turn of events late yesterday as Trump signed a [stopgap](https://ibb.co/ctsF0pn) bill again to fund the US agencies for another week, but threatened to not sign the [stimulus](https://ibb.co/9Wf6n9P) bill and [demanded](https://ibb.co/sFvMkNv)  bigger stimulus checks up to $2000 for individual Americans. I think this is really more of a bluff from him, as I don’t think he can do anything at this point. Even if he doesn’t sign this deal, it is very likely that Congress will act quickly as the necessary veto-proof votes have been reached in both the Senate and the House, as I think, it’s rather unlikely, they can negotiate more than this, as Republicans will demand something in return. Senate Leader McConell has [already](https://ibb.co/Fsn4BQy) set up a veto override effort for next Tuesday in case Trump does veto the bill, so we will have to wait and see what Trump does today, as my belief is that he did whole thing just so people wouldn’t talk about the pardons he gave out yesterday.

In some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/KDDZ01D), we also saw Vaccine companies like Moderna and BioNTech continue to drop after they were hugely bought as a reaction to the vaccine news in the last months, as the new strain is causing some doubt in them, but I don’t think this is going to be a problem for them, but I do still think they are way to expensive at the moment, as I said in a previous post, I think Moderna doesn’t deserve more than a $100 price at the moment. And I don’t even believe that Pfizer which is nearing another [deal](https://ibb.co/ggtmmXc) to provide even more doses to the US is poised for big growth ahead, the one that I am keeping an eye on is JNJ, as their vaccine only needs 1 dose and is due to have some data for release early in 2021.

Meanwhile Boeing received some good [news](https://ibb.co/c8d8xFj) as Alaska Airlines announced a better deal with the company to acquire 68 planes with options for another 52 in the future. This is very good news for the company as they have had a big number of orders canceled in 2020. Alaska looked to take advantage of the reduced order backlog and probably a good discount on the deal. So yeah, full disclosure I own Boeing and I think they will do better in the next years as they are still trading well below all time-highs.

We also got news from Store Capital as they announced [rent](https://ibb.co/YLpLZVg) collections of 90% in December, on par with the last months, this is a good read on the economy, as most business manage to survive these last few months of lockdowns before things will get better and return to a more normal life & business cycle.

And one last good piece of [news](https://ibb.co/NCB5bxJ) for us retail investors is that the NYSE approved the direct listing plan for IPOs, this will level the playing field for us everyday investors and will also provide companies with another path of going public.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/CPD8t3h) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the SP500 & Nasdaq Composite leading the way.

2020-12-08 06:31:00,TESLA sell $5B in shares | Stock market news | Why stock market investors predict gains in 2021 |[12-08],"**Tesla just announced that it’s selling $5B again, retail investors expect big gains next year despite the recent uncertainty in the US with the relief package debacle, cases rising at very high rates and the government maybe facing a temporary shutdown**

Hey everyone ! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/zn9tpLg) down by half a percent, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/p4M2n7J) down 0,2% while the tech heavy [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/wKwCKwg) outperformed, finishing up 0,45 and closing yet again at a new record high. We did see the volatility [index](https://ibb.co/MNPsRvH) going higher, as more uncertainty puts some pressure on the markets with the stimulus and government funding bill on the [table](https://ibb.co/wzM6bt0).

We saw a bigger [ratio](https://ibb.co/TWQQdcx) of companies losing ground yesterday as small caps and especially growth companies outperformed the value plays [yesterday](https://ibb.co/DVpQVkH) with gains being made only in Technology, Utilities and Communications [sectors](https://ibb.co/BrbBWSV) while Energy was the biggest loser as the illness still keeps the pressure on the Oil business.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/fDSSmKp) from yesterday as 3 of the big FAANG names outperformed the market yesterday, with Apple being up more than 1% while FB and NFLX did even better up 2 and 3,5% for the day. You can also see a lot of red in this map as not many companies did good yesterday except big tech names.

So, some TESLA [news](https://ibb.co/QpNsY6H), yesterday the company spiked to a new all time high at over 640$ as the stock soared over 7% again. The stock has gone up more than 200$ in the last [month](https://ibb.co/xJp0QmJ) as more and more people are buying shares in anticipation of the SP500 inclusion and more and more analysts raise price target and expectations for the company. Tesla also just [announced](https://ibb.co/CJLCnW9) a sell of shares worth of $5B again as the company continues to raise more capital to fund the new factories and firm up the balance sheet while reducing the debt of the company. I think this a good time to be careful and maybe take some profits in this stock before next week, as many people may end up selling shares on the 18th and 21st and we might see a correction instead of a spike in price when the company is included in the SP500. aka \[buy the news/sell the event\] [NEWS](https://ibb.co/1ZLmb8w)

Some of the economic data that we received yesterday was worse than expected as the home purchase sentiment [index](https://ibb.co/fYW7jYD) rising streak ended this month with a dip of 1.7 points and is down more than 11 points year over year.

While the TD Ameritrade Investor Movement is [index](https://ibb.co/N1mkxK7) down from the previous month as investors bought more Apple, Tesla and AT&T shares while selling Moderna, Beyond Meat and Micron.

Also, the small business optimism [index](https://ibb.co/FVg3827) dipped more than expected and fell to 101,2, down from 104 in October.

So, a recent survey from Investopedia [shows](https://ibb.co/hFcyKCM) that over 20% of investors are expecting gains of at least 10% for next year with more than ¾ expecting that 2021 will be another positive year for the stock market.

Most investors [expect](https://ibb.co/1sRKWyt) the biggest gains to be made in the US equities while CHINA and other emerging markets are the next to follow with the Eurozone expected to lag.

While this individual investors [expect](https://ibb.co/dj9LbN9) the large cap tech companies to continue to have big gains followed by pharma and health companies. I think this is a recency bias, as I don’t think any one sector will largely outperform next year, with lots of gains to be made everywhere once the full reopening of the economy will begin. [Jim Cramer Quote](https://ibb.co/pL2v0bm)

I think investors are pretty bullish as the AAII [survey](https://ibb.co/wBhx0Fb) showed last week, I think this might be a problem for the stock market. I don’t think the stock market will go up as fast as investors would like, and this might push more of them into more and more risk taking, especially the new investors, which desire to make a fortune fast. I expect the stock market to be higher by this time next year, but the rate of which it will go up is still going to scare some investors off. As the market sentiment is way into euphoria [levels](https://ibb.co/rvzbx3R) as you can see in this survey, and with retail investors being more powerful than ever before as they account for about 20% of the stock market activity on average daily as we also might see some turbulence in the next couple of months until things will become more stable with the economy, vaccines, politics and everything else with the smart money [index](https://ibb.co/P6VJTQ0) continues to drop while stocks reach new highs, this might be the time to take a wait and see approach and maybe try to buy the dips when they come.

Some good [news](https://ibb.co/Q6WXNtp) came early today the first ever recipient of the public vaccine from Pfizer has been vaccinated today in the UK, this is the start of the rollout of the vaccine in the UK and it is expected that the US will follow in the next couple of weeks. As the “vaccine summit” will be in full [display](https://ibb.co/t3zYjJ6) this week. This is great news for the entire world.

On some individual stock news, the darling of the moment Lemonade just [launched](https://ibb.co/F8FLjgF) in its 3rd EU country, in France, following the Netherlands and Germany launches.

While the 2 big [IPOs](https://ibb.co/23ZKRbh) will come on Thursday as both AirBNB and DoorDash are expected to go public at insanely high valuations.

After the close today we will get [Chewy](https://ibb.co/mbPdtQx) earnings results and I expect the company to dazzle and to crush them, as pets have become more and more popular this year.

2021-01-07 05:31:48,"Today's Pre-Market Movers & News [Thursday, January 7th, 2021]","#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Thursday. Here are your pre-market movers & news this AM-

*****

#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, January 7th, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/07/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-january-7-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow set to add to Wednesday’s record despite Capitol turmoil

> * U.S. stock futures rose Thursday, a day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high despite the turmoil at the Capitol. Early Thursday, outgoing President Donald Trump said in a statement there “will be an orderly transition” of power, shortly after Congress confirmed President-elect Joe Biden’s win.

> * Economists expect an increase in initial jobless claims, when the Labor Department reports its weekly numbers at 8:30 a.m. ET. With the seven-day average of new daily U.S. Covid infections spiking to a record high, first-time filings for unemployment benefits are seen rising by 28,000 to 815,000 for the week ended Jan. 2.

> * Ahead of Friday’s government employment report, the ADP’s look at December jobs trends at U.S. companies showed a contraction in private-sector positions for the first time since the early days of the coronavirus. Throughout most of the pandemic, the ADP estimates have been below the final government count.

*****

> # 2. 10-year Treasury yield above 1%; bitcoin above $38,000

> * The 10-year Treasury yield remained above 1% on Thursday morning after projected wins for Democrats in both Senate runoff elections in Georgia. Lightening up on bonds, pushing prices down and yields up, investors bought riskier assets like stocks and bitcoin.

> * The world’s largest cryptocurrency smashed through the $38,000 mark to hit a record high on Thursday as it continued its massive rally. Bitcoin has been up about 29% in the first days of 2021 and is up 380% over the past 12 months.

*****

> # 3. Congress confirms Biden as next president

> * Congress early Thursday confirmed the Electoral College vote for Biden, a day after Trump supporters breached the Capitol in a chaotic effort to avoid the formal recognition that the president lost the election. Shortly after the confirmation, White House spokesman Dan Scavino tweeted Trump’s statement, which promised “an orderly transition on January 20th,” the day of Biden’s inauguration, but also perpetuated the baseless claim that he actually won.

> * Congress’ process of counting Electoral College votes was interrupted Wednesday afternoon when rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol building. A woman who was among the invaders was shot and killed by Capitol Police. Three other people died from medical emergencies.

*****

> # 4. U.S. trade group asks Pence to ‘seriously consider’ invoking 25th Amendment

> * The National Association of Manufacturers, a trade organization representing 14,000 U.S. companies, called on Vice President Mike Pence to “seriously consider” invoking the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to remove Trump from office. Jay Timmons, CEO of the manufacturers group, is a former executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Two Democratic U.S. representatives worked on a letter to Pence requesting he invoke the amendment.

> * Members of Trump’s Cabinet issued harsh rebukes of the violence that unfolded at the Capitol. The officials, however, stopped short of criticizing the president, who had urged his supporters to take action at a pro-Trump rally Wednesday morning.

> * An administration official confirmed to CNBC’s Eamon Javers that National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien and Deputy National Security Advisor Matthew Pottinger are considering resigning over the insurrection. Stephanie Grisham, chief of staff for first lady Melania Trump, and Sarah Matthews, White House deputy press secretary, both resigned Wednesday.

> * Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s former chief of staff, announced on CNBC on Thursday he is resigning as special envoy to Northern Ireland.

*****

> # 5. Democrats win the majority in the Senate

> * During the Capitol siege, Democrat Jon Ossoff was projected as the winner of the second of two Senate runoff elections Tuesday in Georgia. The defeat of Republican David Perdue, whose Senate term expired Sunday, coupled with Democrat Raphael Warnock’s projected victory over Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, splits the 100 Senate right down the middle. However, Democrats take over the majority as Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the tie-breaking vote. After Biden’s inauguration, Democrats will control the Senate, House and the White House.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

2020-11-25 13:52:20,"I draw with crayons so you don't have to. Update: current 'unrealized' gain this week of $1,900 or 3%","On Sunday I posted my [game plan for the week](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jz7n7u/i_draw_with_crayons_so_you_dont_have_to_last_week/) outlining some stocks that were on my watchlist in terms of technicals and entry-points. I updated my plays on Monday morning with my positions.

Due to the short trading week I will be looking to HODL all these positions until next week and maybe close out Monday if we get another pop. I'll still be putting together my game-plan on Sunday for stocks to keep an eye on just incase I close some positions Friday or Monday and free up some capital.

Keep in mind Monday after I entered these positions they all continued to dip. **I was down $600** by mid-day of the Monday trading day, but I wasn't even sweating. I have good entry points and am prepared to HODL shares as always. Yesterday and today was some nice price action for my account as yesterday I regained my losses from Monday and reclaimed the green side and today also gave me a nice jump. Up $1,200 just today on my positions.

These are currently 'unrealized' gains because I haven't sold my positions yet and anything can happen.

**New Position**

**PTON:** Yesterday PTON dipped hardcore down 6%. It was too tempting to resist and sold a put to open when it was down 4%. It continued to dip some more, but I am ok with that. 

I sold the December 11 2020 $101 strike put for $3.6 or $360 in premium. Break-even point is going to be if the stock dips below $97.40, which I dont think it will get that far. If it does I'm completely ok wheeling this stock. It's got strong fundamentals and also a nice IV to collect premium.

**Current Positions**

**PTON:** Mentioned above.

**FB:** Had a nice gain here, will look to close out next week if it continues going up. My strike is pretty safe here and I don't think it will be getting contested.

**KR:** Shares + covered calls. This thing barely moves, but I do expect a very slow grind up.

**LULU:** Going to exit this position next week if I can squeeze out another 10% gain. It's December 18 expiration so it still has a long time to go just for that 30% gain.

**MSFT:** Shares. Slow and steady grind hoping I can get closer to my price target of $220 where it will meet the armed guards of the resistance.

**NVDA:** Shares. Had a good little pop today, I still think this can get up to $550 before I close out my shares and look for new opportunities.

**SHOP:** Shares. SHOP had a great today. Started the week at the bottom of the trend/channel and is starting it's grind up to the upper side. Looking for $1,050 before I consider exiting my shares.

2020-12-30 07:33:34,What other sectors should I be looking at?,"I'm talking about my Roth IRA, not a brokerage account, so I'm not particularly worried about short positions and I'm down to invest for 10 or 20+ years too. 

My portfolio at this time is \~ 40% renewables (ICLN, QCLN, TAN), 35% tech/gadgets (MSFT, AAPL, SNE, CRSR), and the last 25% is miscellaneous (TGT, MJ, JETS). I'm pretty comfortable with these  but I feel like I should get into another sector for the sake of diversity, right? 

I know people here love VOO/SPY/QQQ but that GOOG/FB/AMZN exposure makes me uncomfortable so I'm not sure that's the route I want to go. 

What other sectors do you love and why? Thanks in advance.",3,0.67

2020-10-28 18:07:12,"Pinterest’s pandemic surge continues, stock jumps more than 25% toward fresh record highs","Pinterest thrashes earnings estimates while adding another 26 million active users, stock again heads for big gains after earnings and pushes Twitter and Facebook shares higher too.

Pinterest Inc. continued to experience a surge in new users during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to larger-than-expected profit and revenue growth this summer, according to a Wednesday earnings report that sent shares on another ride toward fresh record highs.

Pinterest PINS reported a third-quarter loss of $94.2 million, or 16 cents a share, on revenue of $442.6 million, up from $280 million a year ago. After adjusting for stock-based compensation and other factors, the company reported earnings of 13 cents a share, up from adjusted earnings of a penny a share a year ago. Analysts on average expected adjusted earnings of 4 cents a share on sales of $383 million.

Pinterest shares jumped more than 25% in after-hours trading following the report, after closing with a 7.1% decline at $48.78. Shares were topping $63 in the extended session after closing with a 6.2% decline at $49.25; Pinterest shares have never traded for higher than $53.87 in regular trading.

Pinterest shares have more than doubled to record highs since the social-media company’s last earnings report, which predicted much higher revenue and user growth than previously expected. The online-advertising market seems to have found strength despite the pandemic, as strong third-quarter financial results last week from Snap Inc. SNAP sent stocks in ad-supported online companies higher across the board.

Online-ad stocks also experienced a jump after Pinterest’s report, which arrived 24 hours ahead of quarterly reports from online-ad powerhouses Facebook Inc. FB , Alphabet Inc. GOOGL GOOG and Twitter Inc. TWTR . Twitter shares gained more than 5% in the extended session Wednesday, while Facebook stock increased more than 2% and Google parent Alphabet added about 1%.

Pinterest executives said they expect revenue to grow around 60% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, roughly in line with the 58% growth in the third quarter. Pinterest reported revenue of $400 million in last year’s holiday period, so the guidance suggests sales of about $640 million this year, which again trounces expectations. Analysts on average predicted fourth-quarter revenue of $541 million, according to FactSet.

Pinterest stock has gained 165% so far this year, and more than 106% in the past three months, as the S&P 500 SPX index has gained 5% and 5.4% in those periods.

2020-12-29 14:21:07,A lesson in the stock market?,"Hi, what are your best tips you could give somebody trying to learn to invest. Luckily I’ve made some stupid mistakes already and learnt.
I started last August at the ATH with £20k invested, since then ive been +-10% (down to £18k, up to £22k)

Now sitting pretty @ £20,050. So £50 profit in 4 months. No bad? Bad for an apparant “bull” run?

My current portfolio is - 120 shares NET and 30 shares SQ.

£11.5k invested with £8.5 in cash.

I’m interested in “growth”, now please tell me if my thought process is wrong, I’ve done my DD on these companies and expect them to be big, big in 5 years, with a hopeful snp500 inclusing for SQ in the future.

I’m going to DCA down on these with the remaining cash as far down as they go, what would be a good protocol for choosing a price etc? 

And literally just fucking HODL.

If i’d done this in OCTOBER or some shit I’d be a good % up for the end of the year instead of just spun my wheels, I guess I’ve just paid for some lessons :)

Anyway my journey so far has been fun. Stocks that have made and lost me money so far 
FB - MSFT - AAPL - JMP - BABA - PLTR - UPWK - DIS.

Stocks traded choppily once again, going to the red in the morning before recovering throughout the rest of the day. Market participants continue to closely monitor developments from Washington regarding stimulus, a better-than-expected unemployment report, and third-quarter corporate earnings. 

The Nasdaq (QQQ) underperformed today, finishing the day even. The S&P 500 (SPY) finished 0.56% up and the Dow Jones (DIA) ended the day 0.62% up.

House Speaker Pelosi once again expressed optimism that an additional round of fiscal could be passed before the November 3 election, even as disagreements on key provisions remain in the White House. Pelosi said, “We’re just about there. The president wants a bull. That’s part of the opportunity we have. Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were scheduled to speak on Thursday to discuss the deal, and the White House’s last public offer stood at around $1.88 trillion for a stimulus proposal, versus the $2.2 trillion plan put forth by House Democrats.

However, the proximity of the election and the lack of support for a bill in the GOP have market participants increasingly doubtful that a bill will be passed, fueling further volatility and uncertainty in the market. 

The Department of Labor released its weekly unemployment report, which showed that another 787,000 Americans filed for first-time unemployment claims, much better than the 870,000 expected by analysts. However, it is important to note an increasing number of individuals have exhausted state unemployment and have rolled into longer-term pandemic-related assistance programs. This shows the devastating effect the pandemic has had on the labor market. 

Today is the second and final presidential debate between President Trump and Joe Biden. The debate will take place in Nashville, Tennessee and will begin at 9 p.m. Eastern time and run for 90 minutes.

2020-10-01 13:23:03,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, Oct 1. Please enjoy!"," **PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, October 1, 2020**

Stocks jumped higher in the first session of October before losing strength throughout the session, buoyed by hope that lawmakers will provide more stimulus before the November election and slightly better than expected unemployment numbers. 

The three major indices closed out the month of September red, falling an average of 4% for the first monthly loss since March. The major benchmarks posted their worst September performance since 2011, according to Yahoo Finance. But zooming out to include trading from July and August, equities’ third-quarter performance held up much more strongly. The S&P 500 posted its best third-quarter advance since 2010 with a rise of 8.5%, per Bloomberg.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) ended the day 1.59% up, the S&P (SPY) finished 0.62% up, and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.22% in another volatile session.

It seems traders are expecting September’s volatility to carry into October, with political uncertainty surrounding the presidential election at the top of their mind, especially after the, shall we say, contentious debate. Hopes for additional, much-needed stimulus dimmed after in-person talks between Pelosi, Mnuchin, and Congressional lawmakers did not produce an agreement. While the pair said they made progress and had further discussions planned, many are skeptical any kind of deal will be reached before the election in November.

For the many, the economic situation at the hands of the pandemic remains dire, with a slew of job cuts being announced. Airlines American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) are moving forward with a collective 32,000 job cuts after contingencies tied to federal coronavirus relief aid they received earlier this year expired on Wednesday. Disney (DIS) said it would be cutting 28,000 workers across its resort business. Insurance giant Allstate (ALL) announced an 8% reduction in its workforce, impacting some 3,800 jobs. Goldman Sachs (GS) is also reportedly looking to cut about 400 jobs, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, and the oil major Shell (RDS) announced plans to cut up to 9,000 jobs.

The labor report released this week will not capture these planned layoffs, those will most likely be reflected in next weeks’ report. The Labor Department reported that another 837,000 people filed for first-time unemployment insurance. While this is below the 850,000 estimate and an improvement on last week's number, it is clear that the labor market is still struggling during the pandemic and needs Congressional assistance to get back on track.  Tomorrow September’s monthly jobs report will be released. Analysts expect a fifth straight month of payroll gains and 868,000 jobs to have come back. However, after the announcement of massive job cuts this week, we’ll have to see if analysts revise their estimates.

**Highlights**

* US manufacturing activity unexpectedly decelerated in September, according to the Institute for Supply Management’s (ISM) monthly manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI). The index ticked down to 55.4 in September from 56.0 in August, whereas consensus economists expected a rise to 56.5. 
* The Senate Commerce Committee voted to authorize subpoenas forcing testimony from Facebook (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey, and Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet (GOOG) setting up what could be a contentious hearing with the largest U.S. social-media companies in the midst of a national election.
* As big U.S. commercial banks close their books on the third quarter, analysts expect them to report a 30% to 60% plunge in profits on the year-ago period due to the pandemic-induced recession and near-record low-interest rates.
* The Mark Zuckerberg-led company said in a statement that the advertising restrictions would be in place between Oct. 27 and Nov. 3. The latest policy change targets any ads that question voting methodology, delegitimize any lawful method of voting or voting tabulation, or make claims of widespread voter fraud, as per Facebook’s statement.
* New Ford[ ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24F&src=cashtag_click)(F) CEO Jim Farley starts today. He's taking the reins from outgoing CEO Jim Hackett.

Stocks traded higher today as market participants looked ahead to stimulus talks in Washington that appear to be progressing and an upcoming round of quarterly that are expected to be improved relative to earlier in the year.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) was on fire today, finishing the day 3.09%, as the rebound in big tech continues from the September lows.. The S&P (SPY) finished 1.59% up and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.87%.

Prospects for further fiscal stimulus coming from Congress has been a main point of interest for traders since the CARES Act, the first round of stimulus passed in March, ran out on July 31. Though prospects for additional passage before the November election are slim, recent reports of a $1.8 trillion proposal coming from the White House and renewed talks between Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Last week’s meetings between the pair did not produce an agreement, both parties are optimistic that a deal will  be worked out. In an interview with CNN, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow offered an upbeat assessment of the negotiations, saying that “the bid and offer is narrowing somewhat between the two sides.” While there is a large delta between both proposals, the fact that the White House is showing a willingness to negotiate and compromise is a good sign that negotiations are going forward in good faith. 

Third-quarter earnings begin in earnest this week. A host of big banks, including JP Morgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C), will report earnings tomorrow. Big banks, which have underperformed the broader market since the March bottom, will provide valuable information into the extent of the ongoing strain to the US economy as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. 

For this earnings season, analysts expect companies to report more year-on-year declines in profits due to business difficulties arising from the pandemic. According to data collected by FactSet, consensus estimates predict a earnings per share decline of 20.5% over the last year for companies in the S&P 500. This earnings season comes at a very interesting time, with the market primed for several market-moving events, including the possibility of vaccine and therapeutic breakthroughs to treat coronavirus and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming presidential election. According to analysts at Goldman Sachs (GS), “New information on the election, vaccines, and upcoming 3Q earnings represent substantial cross-currents for equities during the next two months. However, the vaccine represents a more important factor than the election result for the recovery in S&P 500 fundamentals. In short, the progress of the US economy depends more on developments surrounding the disease rather than political elections or candidate differences in restoring the broken fundamentals of the stock market.

Losses in the stock market accelerated today as market participants nervously eyed rising coronavirus case counts in the US and Europe, the presidential election a mere 6 days away, and developments out of Washington regarding stimulus.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) slid 3.90$ down, the S&P 500 (SPY) fell 3.41%, and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 3.35%.

In the United States, there were 73,240 coronavirus cases reported yesterday, according to Johns Hopkins University. Alarmingly, the average number of daily new cases in the US rose  21% compared to the previous week. According to an article from CNN Health, the surge is hitting all parts of the country, with 40 states reporting at least a 10% increase in daily average cases, compared to last week. Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University School of Public Health, said, “Cases are rising quickly. If we go back about six, seven weeks ago to Labor Day, we \[the United States\] were at about 35,000 cases a day.”  U.S. hospitalizations related to COVID-19 have risen by at least 10% over the past week across 32 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One good thing is the FDA approval of remdesivir, a therapeutic developed by Gildead (GILD) that was used to treat the president.

In Europe, the average number of daily cases rose by 33% compared to last week, accounting for the greatest proportion of new cases in the world, according to data compiled from worldometer.info. France is the hardest hit country in Europe. On Tuesday, it reported more than 33,400 new cases and 523 coronavirus deaths in 24 hours, as well as a net increase of 74 admissions to intensive care, bringing the total  to 2,918, over half the country's overall capacity of 5,800. French President Emmanuel Macron announced nationwide restrictions for the next four weeks. Germany joined France, imposing its own four-week nationwide lockwide, which includes curfew and restrictions on businesses like gyms, bars, restaurants, hairdressers etc.

Yesterday, President Trump publicly acknowledged that an agreement on additional stimulus would not happen until after the election. While he signaled that his administration was still willing to negotiate, with the election a mere 6 days away, the chances of stimulus passing before then are practically zero.

Stocks traded choppily after yesterday’s selloff, with the indices losing an average of 5% from their October highs. Market participants are closely monitoring the rising number of coronavirus cases in the US and Europe and uncertainty surrounding stimulus and the presidential election a mere week away.

In the US, over the weekend, the US registered coronavirus cases hit a record high with more than 81,000 new cases, according to data gathered from worldometers.info. Yesterday, the US registered 70,000 new cases. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert said the US is still in the “first wave” of the pandemic, given that cases never stabilized to more than a “manageable level.” He explained that while the Northeast has been able to reduce its outbreak, the national baseline never fell to a more manageable number like 10,000 cases per day.

With a worrying surge of cases across Europe, governments have begun imposing a new round of restrictions. Today, the Czech Republic joined France, Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom in enforcing a strict nighttime curfew and placing new restrictions in businesses such as gyms and restaurants. 

Yesterday, Speaker Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin met for what feels like the hundredth time to discuss the passage of additional stimulus. Pelosi’s spokesperson Drew Hamill said of the meeting, “The Speaker remains optimistic that an agreement can be reached before the election,” adding that “progress depends on Leader Mitch McConnell.” Today, Senators left Washington for a break ahead of the election. With the election a mere week away and Senators no longer in Washington, chances to pass a bill are extremely thin. 

Next Tuesday, November 3rd are the US presidential elections between Joe Biden (D) and President Trump (R). The election is set to be extremely contentious and will have enormous effect on the market for years to come.

Stocks were higher today, with the major benchmarks finishing the day an average of 1.5% up. This unexpected rally comes amid a surge of coronavirus cases in the United States and Europe and concerns that more fiscal stimulus will not be passed.

The SPY finished 

After a steady decline from summer peaks through the beginning of September, new COVID-19 cases appear to be on the rise again in the United States. According to data from the *New York Times*, there have been 41,822 new cases per day in the country over the past week, a 14% increase from the previous 2 weeks. Among the states seeing the largest increases in new cases over the past 14 days are Wisconsin, North Dakota, and South Dakota.

In recent weeks, Europe has struggled to contain a surge in the number of coronavirus cases, with many countries reporting a record number of infections. In France 16,069 new case of Covid-19 were reported, a record for the country. The U.K., which recently announced plans to lockdown once again, reported a record 6,634. These numbers are worse than in March, at the beginning of the pandemic. In response to the increasingly precarious situation, European leaders decried the failure of countries to work together to collectively defeat the virus and told the U.N. General Assembly today that \`\`the time has come for countries to reinvent international cooperation.” Throughout the pandemic, European nations have fought internally about access to equipment and vaccines, erected barriers among neighbors to keep out virus infections, and struggled to agree on collective solutions to fight COVID.

Today’s rally in the stock market reflects the heightened volatility equities have experienced this month, as concerns over the presidential elections, a surge in coronavirus cases, the slowing pace of economic recovery, and the lack of fiscal stimulus pile up. House Democrats are reportedly working on a $2.4 trillion stimulus plan, which would be down from the more than $3 trillion they originally pursued, but a sum still well above the closer to $1 trillion proposal Senate Republicans had suggested they might accept. 

For their part, monetary officials like Powell and Mnuchin have urged time and again for Congress to pass additional fiscal relief, though the window of opportunity continues to shrink as the November election looms. Eric Rosengren, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, told Yahoo Finance that while the central bank could increase asset purchases to try and support the economy, he was not sure it would be “nearly as supportive, for example, as fiscal policy.”

Taken together, the myriad concerns manifested themselves in a surge in volatility this month, with stocks changing direction from one day to the next and even intraday. Matt Orton, Director and Portfolio Manager at Carillon Tower Advisers said, “We’ve shot up really, really far. We’ve just \[gone\] through a little bit of a corrective process, taking out some of the froth from the really high-flying performers in the information technology space. And right now with an absence of many catalysts as we head into earnings season, we’re likely going to continue to move sideways.”

Stocks traded choppily today as market participants closely monitor development in Washington surrounding stimulus. Though Pelosi’s self-imposed deadline of 48-hours to reach an agreement came and went, discussions continue.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.08% down, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 0.21% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) underperformed the most, ending the day 0.35% down.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg TV that she was willing to keep stimulus discussions open past her Tuesday deadline and said she is “optimistic” about the progress being made. White House Chief of Staff Market Meadows said on CNBC that negotiators were working hard to get a deal done by the weekend, and that White House increased its offer by another $80 billion to $1.88 trillion.

Despite support from the President and top government officials, questions remain over whether the Republican-controlled Senate, who have publicly disparaged the bill, would vote to advance any deal. Senate Republicans have so far baulked at the high price-tag the proposals. According to an article released by the New York Times, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell privately told Republican senators on Tuesday that he had warned the White House not to strike a pre-election deal with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a new round of stimulus, moving to head off an agreement that President Trump has demanded but most in his party oppose. McConnell’s remarks, which were confirmed by four Republicans familiar with them, threw cold water on Mr. Trump’s increasingly urgent push to enact a new round of pandemic aid before Election Day and came just as Ms. Pelosi offered an upbeat assessment of her negotiations with Steven Mnuchin.

In other news, Senate Democrats successfully blocked the Republicans’ attempt to pass a targeted $500 billion coronavirus bill, with Pelosi, Mnuchin, and the White House engaged in a desperate attempt to come to a much-needed agreement before the November election. The bill, similar to one the Republicans tried to pass some weeks ago, fell in a 51-44 vote, falling short of the 60 supermajority required. Republicans in Congress argue Democrats have reached for an expensive wish list filled with many provisions unrelated to the crisis. McConnell said the Democrats are engaging in “all-or-nothing obstruction” as they hold out for a comprehensive deal worth about $2 trillion. In response, Democrats accuse the GOP of failing to recognize the magnitude of the economic and health crisis that is gripping the country. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (Democrat, New York) has called the Republican plan paltry, partisan, and emaciated. 

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she “has a prospect for an agreement” with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on a coronavirus stimulus package, but floated the possibility that it may not come together in time to pass both chambers before the Nov. 3 election. “There will be a bill. The question is: is it time to pay the November rent — my goal — or will it be shortly after. I want people to know that help is on its way. It will be bigger. It will be better. And it will be retroactive.” It seems the chances for any sort of short-term stimulus before November 3 are slipping away.

2021-01-15 14:22:44,using/ understanding margin s," 

Hi I have the option of using a 2.5% margin rate. Iv been debating utilizing this to increase my capital. Illl explain my position below but my main questions would be the following. Has anyone used margin with thier brooker how was your experience? If I keep the account funded will I be safe from margin calls? For instance, if I have a 50 k account and take 10k in margin will I be fairly safe to avoid margin calls. Im a bit confused if margin calls have to do with the exact equity going down or the whole value of the account? The last thing I want is to have some of my postions sold off. Is now a good time to start using margin or should I wait for an inevitable correction? (may be fomoing ) What are some safer plays to utilize the funds with? Im looking at things in a 1-5 year timeline

I have about 4.5 years managing my own funds with decent success beat the sandp and nasdaq during that time. Iv been through a few ups and downs still got plenty to learn though. Iv got a little over 200k in the market with some cash on the sidelines to keep some powder dry about 10% but im starting to think it would make more sense to use margin then utilize my cash. I do personally feel the market is really hot right now so that is making me cautious. I may wait until we have a correction to go through with this. I was thinking of taking 10k in margin and splitting it between AMZN, FB, Low, BMY. Or would it be better to just put it into voo or qqq. Sorry for the rambled post but wanted to get all my thoughts out. Any thoughts, suggestions or experiences would be appreciated. thanks",3,1.0
2020-04-10 09:38:29,Sharing my top companies with you.,"I just finished my watchlist after evaluating 300+ companies. It took me two weeks of full-time reading financials, calculate the maths and look up news around the companies for the last year. You don't have to take anything for granted, I'm not a professional analyst, just a guy with a lot of time and a decent look on financials. I'm not here for credit, I just think it might help some people and since it took a lot of time, it feels like a waste if I didn't share it.

It's a lot of tech, but I feel like it's also the way to go, especially during this crisis. I'm mostly staying away from the financial and real estate, but will invest more when there's a more clear image on the situation later this year. Healthcare, Industrial, Military and Energy are very dependent on political changes, so I'm also careful with those. Anyway, here we go.

**- ALPHABET -A-.** Cash king, enough to pay off all their liabilities easily. Very nice growth over the years, even when they're so big. Most of the times, you see blue chips / market leaders stagnate, but not Google. Advertising will take a hit and there might be restrictions on online privacy in the upcoming years, but they are still very strong armed to take on those setbacks.

**- ARISTA NETWORKS.** Same as Google, very strong financials, growth and cash position. Only negative, is that they had a growth setback in Q4 of last year, but nothing indicates it's gonna keep on decaying. They will keep on gaining market cap from Cisco. Very innovative management team with experience in networking. They create high performance cloud networks for big datacenters. Microsoft and Facebook are some of their biggest clients.

**- FACEBOOK.** This is double, I feel like next two years is a make or break for Facebook. On one hand, they still need to improve a lot on AI and control on fake news. They had (and probably still have) privacy issues as well and they will lose a lot of advertising revenue this year. On the other hand, Facebook is expanding a lot to different parts of tech. They have Oculus coming out for VR and they just started with FB Gaming. It's also not only Facebook, but they own WhatsApp and Instagram as well. To me, those are great companies at the moment and have an insane amount of users. Their growth over the past 5 years was close to 300% and they are also cash heavy.

**- GALAPAGOS.** To give you some numbers: in comparison to 2017, they increased revenue by 469%, while expenses only increased by 111%. In comparison to 2015, numbers are 1391% and 253%. Their cash position is double the total liabilities and 10 times their expenses in 2019. You might say they're very ready to take on this crisis. On the operational side, they have multiple medicines in later trial phases and they're backed by biotech giant Gilead Sciences.

**- INCYTE GENOMICS.** Another biotech company with great financials. They even reduced expenses since 2017, while they generated 40% more revenue. This year, 25% more hedgefunds have bought into Incyte, making it a total of 46 hedgefunds who own shares in this company. There is also 17,10% of the company owned by insiders, which shows they strongly believe in their company as well. The average insider percentage of all companies in my watchlist will be 6-8%

**- LULULEMON ATHLETICA.** Steady growth. Cult-like following with their fitness programs. It's a real millennial staple. Very strategic store openings as well. I see a lot of growth potential, especially when they can get some celebrity athletes to wear their clothing. That will make their young and hip image even bigger. Quality wise, they are way better than giants like Nike and Under Armour, which will also result in better image and growing customer fanbase.

**- MASTERCARD.** Very big profit margins (57% last year). One of the least best on financials in this list, but indispensable with a heavy growing e-commerce. Some might rather look at Visa, but I feel like Mastercard is more innovative. They invested in AI-powered authentication and cybersecurity. They are also more used by fintech companies, which is a sector that also will only grow the next 5-10 years.

**- MICROSOFT.** No brainer. Biggest company in the world. Since their new CEO, they're headed definitely in the right direction. Microsoft changed focus from hardware to cloud computing. The cloud services are still in their early year, I see an enormous growth potential. Also very big usage of Teams. It's a personal opinion, but with those quarantine restrictions, I feel like a lot of companies will realize letting their employees work from home has a lot of financial advantages, which will result in sale of more virtual working devices.

**- NVIDIA.** Market leader on semiconductors, making chips that process AI mathematic operations. They didn't grow that much in the last 3 years, but they are very cash heavy and ready to invest in the future. They are invested in all the big things for the future. Cloud, data, AI, gaming,... Some say GPU's are the best investment for the next 5, 10, 25 years, since you will find them in literally everything. For example, it will become an essential part of self-driving cars.

**- VEEVA SYSTEMS.** One of the youngest company in this list, specialized in cloud computing in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry. Best of both world if you ask me. It's revenue is mostly based on subscriptions, so there are almost no surprised there. That's also the main reason why this stock is so expensive. They have beaten revenue expectations for 20 quarters in a row now. Innovative CEO, who will keep on searching to diversify and growing, getting more into data and programmatic advertising. Financial wise, they also have enough cash to pay off all their liabilities and to get through at least one year without any income.

One last thing: These companies are picked based on financials and future outlook, I didn't take value into account. I know companies like Lululemon Athletica and Veeva Systems are expensive, quite overvalued. I'm not buying into them right now, but maybe in the future.

Hope it helped at least one of you out there, enjoy the Easter weekend!

2020-11-15 20:00:49,What is Reddit's opinion on investing in Blackrock Investments (BLK)?,"Blackrock commands over $7.1 Trillion, most of which is through ETFs, of which Blackrock has a 36% global marketshare. Considering that ETFs make up about half of all investments, that means Blackrock manages about 15-19% of the global market. This company is not going away anytime soon.

They are a unique combination of massive market power and limited name-recognition. Billions of people know Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), and Amazon (AMZN) as common household utilities, yet in comparison, nobody knows about Blackrock. 

Blackrock is the largest individual investment-managing company. It is more-commonly referred to by their iShare ETFs. 

I have been using ishares index ETFs for almost a decade. For almost half of my life, I have been investing through blackrock, and those investments have grown faster than any of my other investment ventures.

I finally pulled the trigger on buying BLK when it dropped to it's March/early April low.

Seeing now that Biden is just about to seal a victory, my thoughts go to the older workers nearing retirement concerned for their investments. They will most likely want to DCA 1-3 times per quarter into ETFs to lessen the risk of potential executive orders on the market. 

I believe that ETFs will become the go-to investment for the next 4-8 years, thus making Blackrock a great investment.

2018-11-13 09:52:40,An argument for Facebook (FB),"There has been a lot of pessimism surrounding the tech industry recently and I truly believe these claims are overblown.

Much of the heat has fallen on the once darling tech company, Facebook, which has fallen over 25% from its ATH.  This correction, while justified, is also extremely exacerbated by the overwhelming (and often redundant) amount of negative news against the social media giant.  Here are my arguments for why Facebook is currently trading at a bargain and why that bargain won't last.

&#x200B;

* ""Senator, we make ads."" Despite your personal gripes with Zuckerburg, there is no denying that this is a man who knows what his company does and more importantly, how his company makes money.  Sure, there have been executives leaving Facebook for artistic choices regarding monetization over the social experience, but as investors, the push for monetization is exactly why this company is a screaming buy.  Facebook and Google combined account for the vast majority of advertising profits.  Though many people loosely throw around the phrase ""printing money"", Facebook seems to be the only company that is quite literally doing that.

&#x200B;

* ""Data is king.""  If data is king, then Facebook is the hard drive.  It is 100% true, the market for Facebook is saturated.  USER GROWTH IS SLOWING.   That makes sense when you're reaching over 2 billion DAUs.  The argument that the company is worth less because user growth is slowing is not just incorrect, but completely foolish and exactly the reason why this company is severely discounted.  Facebook literally has data on almost every single person on the face of this earth.  Yes, they are going to have data breaches.  No company has ever reached the scale in data that Facebook currently commands.  With that comes new challenges that I believe Facebook is actually handling extremely well.

&#x200B;

* Multiple revenue streams is an overlooked given.  I don't want to dwell on this point too much as it will be discussed in a future bullet point.  But Facebook is a titan because it is not a one trick pony.  Long gone are the days of ""Facebook, the social media company.""  Facebook is a conglomerate.  They own subsidiaries that bring in cash and have dormant segments that have yet to be monetized.  The prime examples that come to mind are WhatsApp and Instagram which is currently in its infancy in terms of monetization.

&#x200B;

* Implicit redundancy of users.  Imagine this, 7.53 billion people on the face of this earth, but 10 billion+ using Facebook or a Facebook subsidiary every day.  How is this possible?  Implicit redundancy.  I log into facebook, browse it for a few minutes and get bored before hopping onto IG.  A message pops up on my phone using my Whatsapp messenger.  3 hits, one person.  When, NOT IF, Facebook monetizes these platforms to their fullest capacity (without compromising performance), they will literally be catering to an impossibly large market.  The largest the world has ever seen.

&#x200B;

* Tech Growth and Diversification.  Everything can pretty much be wrapped into here and I'm going to do just that.  The tech sector is slowing down.  But at the same time, its vamping back up.  Facebook is just beginning to dabble in VR and AI.  Personally, I believe AI is the future and VR is an auxiliary function.  But regardless of what I think, they have their hands in the future.  Their diversification feeds back to the idea of them having multiple streams of revenue.  Data they get from one platform can be leveraged to increase the performance of their AI or other sister platforms.  Facebook is becoming a symbiotic being and when AI is fully developed and integrated into a system that ties all their platforms together.  Well, that's Skynet for you.

Honestly, writing this out makes me even more excited for this company.  It is trading lower than I thought it would be trading and I have put my money where my mouth is and have been buying religiously at these levels.  When you invest in Facebook, have no doubt, you are investing in the future.  I do not want to put a monetary value on where the stock will be in a few months or in a year.  But I will tell you that an investment in this company WILL pay off.  In 10 years, Facebook will be around and more prevalent than ever, even if it has a different name.  My investment thesis is still in tact and the fundamentals of this company are as strong as ever.  Facebook long.",25,0.71

# **The stock market shakeout is likely not over yet, even with Friday’s comeback  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/04/the-stock-market-shakeout-is-likely-not-over-yet-even-with-fridays-comeback.html)**
*****
> The tech wreck is probably not over, despite Friday’s market comeback.
*****
> Analysts expect the shakeout in stocks to continue after the long Labor Day weekend, especially in technology names and the Nasdaq, areas of the market that notched the sharpest gains.
*****
> After August’s 7% gain in the S&P 500, stocks started September strong, and then just as quickly rolled over. The Nasdaq lost 5% Thursday and was down sharply Friday but pared losses to decline 1.5%. The S&P 500 was down about 2.3% for the week, even after a 3.5% loss Thursday.
*****
> “I think this is a good wake-up call and a reminder that there are risks out there,” said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. “In August, we did take a little bit off the table.”
*****
> Analysts expect the week ahead to be busy, with holidays ending and more market pros back at their desks. There is some economic data, most importantly Friday’s consumer price index. The reading on consumer inflation is expected to show little change in core inflation with forecasts for a gain of just 0.2% in August, or 1.6% year over year.
*****
> # Froth blowing off
> The stock sell-off came as market pros were becoming increasingly wary of froth in the market, particularly in tech and momentum names. On Friday, it was revealed that SoftBank was behind billions in large options bets on individual tech stocks, like Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Tesla. News reports said the trades were made over the past month, and SoftBank had been building unusually large positions in call options, or those that bet the prices of underlying stocks would rise.
*****
> One analyst said the fact that SoftBank was “gunning the market” makes him worry that there is more selling to come in Nasdaq names. As SoftBank bought call options, the sellers had to buy stocks, conceivably driving up prices in a trading feedback loop.
*****
> “It’s just a trip to the casino,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “If they’re supposed to be an investment company taking a long-term horizon, then trying to juice your short-term return through options, you’ve turned into a hedge fund.”
*****
> JPMorgan strategists said they expect the market to recover gradually, but there are still presidential election uncertainties looming in the next couple of months.
*****
> “The significant reduction in previously extreme long positions in Nasdaq by momentum traders should allow the equity market to recover over the coming weeks, as happened after the June 11th correction,” noted JPMorgan analysts. “But a repeat of the strong gains seen during July and August is less likely over the next two months.”
*****
> Grohowski said there could be more selling in the tech and internet companies, or those that were viewed did well as workers stayed home and the economy was shutdown. “It’s not the start of a big lasting correction, but a forewarning the next couple of weeks and months are going to be choppy. I think it’s going to be a sideways kind of market,” Grohowski said. He added the market could be choppy in the week ahead.
*****
> “We’re a little more cautious, not to mention the market is trading at 23 times our earnings estimates for 2021,” said Grohowski. He said the fact there is about $4.5 trillion in money market funds is a bullish signm since that money could find its way into the stock market.
*****
> Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives strategy at BTIG, said the S&P 500 could dip to its 200-day moving average, or 3,092, before rebounding, which would be about a 15% move in total.
*****
> “I don’t think the sell-off is over. Nasdaq is up 83%s since March 23, the S&P is up 63%,” said Emanuel.

> # Big August: Bullish or Bearish?

> Big August 2020 logged the 4th biggest August percent gain for the S&P 500 since 1949 and the 6th biggest since 1930. But, is this bullish or bearish for the market in the coming months? Hopefully the table below provides some perspective by comparing the previous Top 20 S&P 500 Augusts since 1949 to July, September, Q4 and the succeeding “Best Six Months” November-April.

> Subsequent Septembers were down 15 of 20 years for an average loss of -1.0% (median loss of -0.7%). Q4 is positive with gains in 13 of the 20 years for an average gain of 1.0% (median gain of 3.0%). The following Best Six Months are more bullish, up 16 of the 20 years with an average gain of 7.6% (median gain of 8.5%).

> Looking at just the 7 years that were preceded by big Julys shows some improvement for September but Q4s are worse, containing the largest Q4 losses. Back-to-back big Julys and big Augusts were followed by improved Best Six Months results, up in all 7 instances with a higher average and median gain and the top gain.

> # Analyzing the Jobs Report

> The jobs market remains strong, as the August nonfarm payrolls came in at a solid 1.37 million jobs created, right in line with expectations. This was the fourth consecutive month of gains, up 10.6 million over this time frame. In March and April more than 22 million jobs were lost, so we still aren’t quite to half of the jobs recovered though.

> This was the second consecutive month there was a very weak ADP private payrolls number ahead of the monthly jobs report, adding to the worries, but the actual nonfarm payroll number was once again quite solid. Don’t forget, just yesterday we saw initial jobless claims come in at 881,000, the lowest number since the week ending March 14, another improving employment number.

> The big surprise in today’s report though was the unemployment rate fell to 8.4%, from 10.2% last month and an expected 9.8%. This was the lowest unemployment rate since 4.4% in March.

> “This was an impressive report and once again showed the economy remained quite resilient,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But 8% unemployment is 8% unemployment, so let’s not get too excited, but we’ll still take this improving trend in the employment picture.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, even though more than 10 million jobs have been created in the past four months, the sad truth is we are still quite a long way from recovering all the jobs lost due to the pandemic. In fact, looking at previous cycles, it has taken years for all of the lost jobs to come back and this time doesn’t appear any different.

> One thing to consider is could this solid number make it harder for Washington to agree on the next stimulus plan? We are watching this closely, but with the two sides still close to a trillion dollars apart, today’s report will likely do little to help the two sides come to a quick resolution.

> Last, don’t forget that stocks gained more than 60% in less than six months, so some weakness would be perfectly normal. In fact, looking at the two previous strongest starts to a bull market ever (’82 and ’09) both saw some weakness right around now.

> # 3 Charts To Watch If You Are Bullish

> The S&P 500 Index just closed the door on its best August since 1986, making new all-time highs along the way, while also closing up five months in a row.

> First things first, make no mistake about it; this is a new bull market. That of course doesn’t mean it will last years like previous bull markets, but a nearly 57% gain in 5 months is what we’d classify as a bull market.

> Here are all the bull markets going back to the Great Depression and where this one ranks.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.2.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Now let’s dig into the 5 month win streak. It is quite rare for stocks to gain from April through August, as the summer months tend to be somewhat tricky. Yet, we found there were six other years that saw these 5 months all close higher and the rest of the year was higher five times, with some solid returns in there. In fact, the only year that was lower the rest of the year was 2018, mainly due to the Fed policy mistake in December 2018.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.2.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> “What might surprise many investors is 5 month win streaks are actually incredibly bullish going forward,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, a year after a 5 month win streak has seen the S&P 500 higher 25 of the past 26 times.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&P 500 Index gained more than 35% during this 5 month win streak, the most ever. Yet, the future gains after 5 month win streaks is very impressive, higher 25 out of 26 times a year later. An object in motion tends to stay in motion and this sure seems to be the case here.

> # Historic August Opens Door To Worst Month Of The Year

> What a month August has been so far, with the S&P 500 Index up more than 7%, for the best August since 1984. Not to be outdone, this is the first time in history August saw two separate 6-day (or more) win streaks. Last, with one day to go, the S&P 500 has gained 16 days so far this month, for the most since 16 in April 2019. Meanwhile, it is the most up days for any August since 2003.

> “Well, 2020 has laughed at many of these things, but be aware September is indeed the worst month of the year on average,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But what caught our attention was both September and October have a negative return during election years, with October the worst month of the year. Could investors get election jitters again in 2020?”

> As show in the LPL Chart of the Day, September tends to be a weak month. In fact, it is the weakest month on average since 1950. Additionally, the last two times August was up more than 5% were 1986 and 2000; the S&P 500 fell 8.5% and 5.4% in September those years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Breaking things down by just an election year shows that August actually tends to be strong. That obviously played out this year, but now will the weakness we usually see in September and October play out?

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.31.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Finally, after today, the S&P 500 will be up 5 consecutive months. Looking at the other years that saw a similar summer rallies, there tended to be more strength the final 4 months of the year, with only the Federal Reserve policy mistake of December 2018 blemishing this impressive track record.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.31.20-Blog-Chaert-3.png?ssl=1))**

> Yes, this record equity run is extremely stretched, but we would continue to use any pullbacks as an opportunity to add to longer-term core equity holdings, as the economy continues to come back quicker than most expected.

2020-12-09 14:15:20,Facebook - A Monopoly or A Misunderstanding,"I know a lot of people have an opposing opinion but I feel very strongly on this and would like to start a discussion. 

I am by no means saying I agree with FB or it’s ethics and values as a company. However, people seem to misunderstand why FB is the dominant player in social media. It’s because that’s what the market decided. There are and have been other platforms, the closest competition of course was MySpace but I would also loosely consider Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest, LinkedIn, and newly embraced Parley, as well as probably lots of other much smaller platforms. Yes FB made some well calculated acquisitions along the way but all large successful company’s generally do and all their acquisitions went through an approval process. The reason FB is so big is because they had provided the best, most integrated platform, so says the market. 

The other part of this that I truly think many, particularly the older generations, are failing to grasp is exactly what social networking is and that these old laws which much predate company’s like FB can’t be properly applied to social networking. The whole point of a social network is to have as many people on the same network as possible so they can all find each other and interact. So naturally a monopoly will form, as most people don’t want to keep up profiles on many different social media platforms, the vast majority of people just wind up on the biggest and most proven platform. 
This is completely different then say a Oil Company that just aggressively buys up all the competition around it in order to corner the market and have complete control.

Idk. Just my two cents. Would like to hear other thoughts beyond just saying “FB bad blah blah”.",0,0.45
2019-04-01 13:50:41,Facebook (FB) earnings 4/25 guesstimate thread,"What do we think will happen?

Disclosure: I hold & am currently long on FB (at least through the end of summer). 

I think EPS is probably going to beat by a handy margin. Current estimates are for about $1.65. I think we do $1.80-$1.90. 

I think other numbers are mostly stable and the impressive EPS beat will break the low $170s, where the stock has been stuck since the last earnings report. I think this also opens the path forward to $200+ by the next earnings report at the end of July. ",1,0.6

Recently i sold off some assets and now have about 25k to invest and look to grow over the next 2-3 years. I have been trading with an account below 5k value for the last 2 years but mostly big gambles and such. I want to put this money into some growth indexes or stocks

I have contacted a trusted financial advisor but am looking for other opinions on things to include in a new portfolio. I'm willing to take on higher risk investments for potential return.

Thank you for any comments or suggestions.

> # 1. Wall Street set to continue its record run

> U.S. stock futures rose Friday, one day after the Nasdaq closed at a record high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 also closed Thursday at records. Both benchmarks were tracking for weekly gains despite Monday’s sharp drops, the first negative starts to a new year since 2016. The Nasdaq was also solidly higher for the week as Wall Street powered higher over the past two days despite Wednesday’s deadly siege at the U.S. Capitol and its fallout.

> Bitcoin, which topped $40,000 on Thursday for the first time ever, passed $41,000 on Friday. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has been up more than 30% in the first days of 2021 and 400% over the past 12 months. The value of the entire crypto market, which is made up of bitcoin and other digital coins, topped $1 trillion Thursday for the first time.

> Tesla shares marched higher in Friday’s premarket after rising 10 sessions in a row, surpassing Facebook in market value, and making CEO Elon Musk the world’s richest person. Thursday’s increase in Tesla’s share price pushed Musk past Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, who had been the richest person since 2017.

> # 2. December jobs report could be weaker than forecast

> The pace of job growth likely slowed dramatically and could even be negative in December, as the coronavirus spread rapidly across the U.S. Economists expect to see a gain of 50,000 jobs, down from 245,000 nonfarm payrolls additions in November. The Labor Department’s monthly employment report is out at 8:30 a.m. ET, and the stock market could react more to a positive surprise than a negative one. The 10-year Treasury yield remained above 1% early Friday ahead of that report.

*****

> # 3. Trump finally concedes Biden will become president

> President Donald Trump late Thursday admitted — for the first time in his own words, despite vowing never to concede — that a “new administration will be inaugurated” on Jan. 20. In a nearly three-minute video, posted after his Twitter lockout ended, Trump did not mention President-elect Joe Biden by name. It came a day after the outgoing president sparked the riot that saw a mob breach the U.S. Capitol in protest of the election.

*****

> # 4. Pelosi, Schumer call for Trump removal from office

> Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are calling for Trump’s removal, accusing him of inciting “insurrection.” Schumer said that if Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet do not move to invoke the 25th Amendment, Congress should reconvene to impeach Trump.

> Pelosi said Congress “may be prepared” to impeach Trump if executive branch officials do not act.

> Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were among the Cabinet secretaries who discussed the possibility of invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump, three sources told CNBC. They determined the process of elevating Pence to the presidency could take more than a week, diluting its effects.

*****

> # 5. Single-day Covid deaths top 4,000 for first time

> The U.S. had its first day of over 4,000 deaths from Covid-19. In the single worst day of the pandemic Thursday, 4,085 people died from the virus. The latest coronavirus surge iaw record seven-day averages of new daily infections and deaths running at 228,497 and 2,764, respectively. As of Thursday, the number of people hospitalized with Covid fell slightly from Wednesday’s record high levels.

> A coronavirus vaccine developed by U.S.-based Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech appears to be effective against a key mutation in the more infectious variants of the coronavirus discovered in the U.K. and South Africa. The research by Pfizer has not been peer reviewed. The World Health Organization said last month that health authorities were “urgently investigating” whether the virus mutation affects vaccine performance.

#**DISCUSS!**

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

*****

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Friday, January 8th, 2021! :)**",4,1.0
2020-10-24 06:40:01,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning October 26th, 2020","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 26th, 2020.

# **There’s a big week ahead for the market with an earnings deluge, GDP data and stimulus negotiations  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/23/theres-a-big-week-ahead-for-the-market-with-an-earnings-deluge-gdp-data-and-stimulus-negotiations.html)**
*****
> About a third of the S&P 500 companies report earnings, including Apple and Microsoft, but uncertainty around stimulus and the presidential election could loom larger for markets in the week ahead.
*****
> There is also important economic data on the calendar, with a first look at third-quarter gross domestic product Thursday. After the second quarter’s shocking 31.4% decline following coronavirus shutdowns, the economy bounced back with growth of 32.5% expected in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> Nearly 170 companies report earnings in the coming week, with a diverse group of blue chips among them, including Boeing, Caterpillar, Honeywell, and Merck. There is also a big showing from large tech names. Microsoft reports Tuesday, and Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook all report in a small window just after the market close on Thursday.
*****
> “For some of these stocks that have run a long way, the bar for those stock to respond to good earnings is higher,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivative strategy at BTIG.
*****
> So far about 85% of S&P companies that have reported earnings beat estimates, about 20 percentage points more than the long term average. Companies have been reporting earnings more than 16% above estimates, and the expectation is that earnings overall will be down about 18%, based on actual results and forecasts, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial average fell 0.95% for the week, breaking a 3-week win streak as coronavirus fiscal negotiations dragged on and tech shares declined.
*****
> “We’ve offered compromises, the speaker on a number of issues is still dug in,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Friday. “If she wants to compromise, there will be a deal. But we’ve made lots of progress in lots of areas, but there’s still some significant areas that we’re working through.”
*****
> His comments knocked stocks down a bit midday Friday.
*****
> “It’s been a muted reaction to earnings overall,” said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. “So I’m disappointed, in a way, as a fundamentally focused chief investment officer, that the stimulus saga seems to be what it’s all about day in and day out, hour by hour. It’s the stimulus saga, the election looming and the Covid resurgence. Those three things have sort of made earnings a page four story.”
*****
> With a week to go before the Nov. 3 election, the market could be a bit more volatile, especially if the outcome looks increasingly less certain.
*****
> “The market is going to focus on the state of stimulus. It’s going to focus on whether the polls are tightening or widening with regard to the probability of having an unclear outcome, contested outcome or both,” said Emanuel.
*****
> Former vice president Joe Biden’s lead has narrowed slightly but he is still ahead in swing state polls.
*****
> “We are experiencing a little bit of the calm before the storm here. I do think we are going to get some 1%, 2% daily moves depending on the news...I think you could see a 3% to 5% down opening the following day [after the election] pretty easily,” said Grohowski. “I think the market has grown increasingly comfortable with a cleaner result, even if the cleaner result is an all blue result, which potentially would result in a higher tax regime.”
*****
> Strategists say the market began to focus more on the possibility of a Democratic sweep, where Democrats take the White House and Congress. That could mean a bigger stimulus package, and some strategists believe tax hikes would be delayed until the economy is on more solid ground.
*****
> “As we get closer to the election, we’re likely to see more volatility no matter what the outcome,” said Grohowski.
*****
> Emanuel said investors are not adequately hedged for an uncertain outcome. “Active managers have the most net long positions they’ve had in a number of years because they’re fearful of missing a year-end rally,” said Emanuel. “The options market in no way, shape or form is telling you people are hedged right here. The market is discounting a slight volatility, not expected to be persistent into year end.”
*****
Emanuel said the options market indicates investors do expect some volatility but not through year end, as some investors began hedging for several months ago.
*****
> “What we see by and large is again the bump in volatility. It’s really only anticipating a 2% or 3% move in the market either way, after the election, and then the expectation is to likely moderate after that,” Emanuel said.
*****
> The final trading day of October is on Friday, so there could also be some added volatility as fund managers readjust their portfolios between bonds and stocks. In the past week, Treasury yields broke out of a four-month range. The 10-year yield rose above 0.80% for the first time since June, and while it could move higher, strategists expect its move to be contained.

> # Nasdaq vs. Dow Outperformance

> You may not realize it, but while the Tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up a ridiculous 28% so far in 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is still in the red on the year.

> Below is a table showing the Dow and Nasdaq's annual percentage change since 1972 when the Nasdaq came into existence. Were the year to end now, the Nasdaq would be outperforming the Dow by 28.65 percentage points. This would be the third strongest outperformance for the Nasdaq on record and the strongest since 1999 when the spread was 60 percentage points!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/dowavg.png))**
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/downazpctchg.png))**
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/spreaduse.png))**

> Below are all years since 1972 in which the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow by at least ten percentage points. The Nasdaq has posted an annual gain of 20%+ in seventeen different years, but never in a year when the Dow was in the red. Probably the year that most resembles 2020 in terms of the performance spread is 1979 when the Nasdaq rose 28.11% and the Dow rose just 4.19%. Following that year in 1980, both the Dow and Nasdaq surged again and the Nasdaq outperformed by another 18.9 percentage points.

> Interestingly, of the twelve years where the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow by more than ten percentage points, the Nasdaq went on to beat the Dow again in the next year eleven out of twelve times. The only time we've seen the Nasdaq crumble versus the Dow in the following year was in 2000 after 1999's outperformance. In 1999, the Nasdaq beat the Dow by a humongous 60 percentage points. After that large gap, though, the Nasdaq ran out of gas in 2000 and underperformed the Dow by 33 percentage points when the Dot Com Bubble finally burst.

> # Leading Indicators Show Slowing Pace of Economic Recovery

> The Federal Reserve’s (Fed) Beige Book presented qualitative data that suggested the pace of the economic recovery had been tapering, as we discussed in the LPL Research blog, Beige Book Shows Pace of Recovery is Moderating, but now we have quantitative data that is confirming the survey data. The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) increased 0.7% month over month in September to beat Bloomberg consensus expectations of 0.6%, but slowed after rising 1.4% in August and 2% in July.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the leading indicators are still growing, but at a slower rate than the blistering pace seen in the initial months after emerging from lockdowns.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.23.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Growth in the LEI in September was primarily driven by the improvement in jobless claims, as well as continued strength in building permits for new private housing—a trend that matches the behavioral shifts to accommodate work from home conditions during the pandemic. The pullback in stock prices last month and manufacturers’ new orders were the lone detractors from the LEI in September.

> “It comes as no surprise that growth began to level off after the surge over the summer, and the softer LEI print is suggesting the economy could be losing momentum heading into the fourth quarter,” said LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “However, despite the slowing momentum, we still expect solid economic growth in Q4, just not quite at the same rate in Q3.”

> The decline in manufacturers’ new orders is likely in relation to election uncertainty, which should prove transitory. However, the recent rise in COVID-19 cases in both Europe and the United States may cause business activity to slow, even if no additional lockdowns are mandated. As we head into the fourth quarter, we will continue to monitor real-time data for any additional clues about the pace of the economic recovery.

> # Halloween Trading Strategy: S&P 500 Up 85% of the Time

> Next week provides a special short-term seasonal opportunity, one of the most consistent of the year. The last 4 trading days of October and the first 3 trading days of November have a stellar record the last 26 years. From the tables above & below:

> * Dow up 77% of the time, 20 of last 26 years, average gain 2.05%.
> * S&P up 85% of the time, 22 of last 26 years, average gain 2.11%.
> * NASDAQ up 85% of the time, 22 of last 26 years, average gain 2.67%.
> * Russell 2000 up 77% of the time, 20 of last 26 years, average gain 2.31%.

> Many refer to our Best Six Months Tactical Seasonal Switching Strategy as the Halloween Indicator or Halloween Strategy and of course “Sell in May”. These catch phrases highlight our discovery that was first published in 1986 in the 1987 Stock Trader’s Almanac that most of the market’s gains have been made from October 31 to April 30, while the market tends to go sideways to down from May through October.

> Recent market weakness has held off our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal so far, but it could trigger anytime now. Uncertainty abounds with surging covid-19 cases, a heated presidential election and persistently elevated unemployment. However, each day that passes is one day closer to a covid-19 vaccine. Interest rates are low and ample liquidity is available to support the market and the economy. Additional fiscal stimulus also appears to be coming soon. Debate continues on the amount, but both parties do appear to agree it is needed in one form or another.

> # ""Quitters""

> Like an old pair of ""quitters"" that keep falling down because their elasticity is shot, the market has had its own trouble staying up over the last few trading days. Today isn't over yet, but if the S&P 500 finishes around current levels it will mark the fourth straight day of finishing down at least half of one percent from its intraday high. Compared to the three days before, today's pullback from an intraday high has actually been pretty mild up to this point. Following Monday's 2%+ decline from the intraday high shortly after the open, yesterday, the S&P 500 traded down close to 1% from its afternoon high. These two reversals followed Friday's late-day sell-off when the S&P 500 finished the day down 0.75% from its intraday high.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102120-Last-Four-Days1.png))**

> While it's disheartening to see the market erasing early gains as the day goes on, it's helpful to put the last four trading days into perspective. Over the last 25 years, it hasn't been uncommon for the S&P 500 to finish the day down at least 0.5% from an intraday high for four days in a row. The current streak, if it holds, would be the 158th such streak of four or more days. That works out to more than six a year. There have also been a number of streaks that were much longer than the current one. In fact, it was only a month ago that the S&P 500 went 11 straight days of finishing the day down at least 0.5% from its intraday high, and besides that streak, there have been five other streaks that spanned ten or more trading days.

> # October Optimism For Homebuilders

> Given housing inventories remain historically low thanks to still strong demand, homebuilders have plenty to be optimistic about. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) has continued to show this strength as its monthly sentiment survey set a record high for the month of October. Back in August, the index tied the previous record level of 78 from December of 1998. Over the past two months, it has only raised that bar, coming in at 85 this month; 2 points above forecasts and last month's reading of 83.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-1.png))**

> The rise in the index comes on broad strength across each of the sub-indices. Present Sales, Future Sales, and Traffic all matched or made record highs in October. The only sub-index that was not higher was for Traffic, though, it was unchanged at a record high.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-Table1.png))**

> As for the look across each of the four US regions, the West and Northeast both saw sizeable upticks to new records, but sentiment in the Midwest and South were actually slightly lower. For the Northeast, this is the third record in a row. Meanwhile, the West's record high in October finally surpassed the prior high of 91 from October of 2005. Finally, even though sentiment fell in the Midwest and South, both remain at higher levels now than any month other than September's record highs.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",98,0.96
2020-09-18 13:31:15,"Here is a Market Recap I wrote for today Sept 18, 2020","**PsychoMarket Recap - September 18, 2020**

Stocks dropped again today, closing out a volatile week on a sour note. Tech stocks continued pulling back, with many notable stocks breaking through well-established supports. In spite of the Fed’s commitment to keep interest rates low until 2023 and mostly positive economic data, the sell off in tech, which is the largest holding in the three major benchmarks, has dragged the market down. 

This week, tech stocks like Apple (AMZN), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) have declined sharply after hitting consecutive record highs in August. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is the hardest hit, with prices at similar levels to early August. The S&P finished the day 1.12% down, the Nasdaq 1.28% down, the Dow was 0.87% down.

After a historic August led by tech stocks, the current volatility in the market has sharply lowered investor sentiment and belief in the prospect of a sharp recovery for the virus-ravaged economy.The still raging pandemic, combined with no fiscal stimulus from Congress, has economists lowering expectations for the remainder of the year. In a note to clients today, Goldman Sachs (GS) said, “At this point, a major stimulus package before the election looks like a long shot and we expect Congress to leave at the end of September without extending the extra unemployment insurance payment, approving another round of stimulus payments, or providing additional support to small businesses or state and local governments. Failure to pass any additional fiscal measures would likely lead us to downgrade our growth estimates for Q4”

Economic data has been surprisingly good in spite of the circumstances. 860,000 people filed unemployment claims, while that’s a lot normally, it has been less than 1 million for the third week straight. Continuing Claims, which are the number of people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim, fell below 13 million for the first time since March highs, an encouraging sign. 

Confidence in the market, right now, is dependent on Congress passing more fiscal stimulus. Top FOMC officials, including Jerome Powell, and Pres. Trump have publicly endorsed the passage of more fiscal stimulus. Economists and politicians agree that more stimulus is needed to boost consumer confidence and provide much-needed support to cash-strapped families and small businesses.

Stocks shot up today and recovered some losses after sharp declines in big tech stocks. After several red days, shares of Amazon (AAPL), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and other big companies rallied. On a sour note, reopening stocks (travel, cruise lines, airlines, hotels, etc) were down after AstraZeneca (AZN) announced it had its COVID-19 vaccine trial paused.

The S&P finished 2.08% up, the Nasdaq was 2.92%, leading the day, and the Dow finished 1.68% up. The volatility index (VIX) was down 4.8%, indicating increased risk appetite in traders.

Today, it was announced that AstraZeneca, a forerunner in the development of the COVID vaccine announced a pause of their experimental trial after one patient became more ill, pledging to make safety a priority and take the time necessary to let science prevail. This setback comes in stark contrast to politicians and governments who seem to imply a cure is just around the corner. Shares of AstraZeneca sank 2%, while those of companies competing to develop a Covid-19 vaccine including Moderna (MRNA) and Novavax (NVAX) rose.

US oil prices plunged nearly 7% today, after Saudi Aramco, the largest oil producer in the world, announced it would be slashing its selling price to Asia and the United States, per Bloomberg. ""Oil demand globally is really sluggish. All of the low hanging fruit from the global oil recovery has already happened,"" said Michael Tran, managing director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Asia-Us cargo rates are at the highest since March lows. For bulls evidence of a rebounding economy, for bears activity is fueled by liquidity and the shoe has yet to drop.

Stocks turned sharply negative again, erasing yesterday’s gains and continuing the decline from the earlier week as investors weighed slowing economic data and the absence of fiscal stimulus. This was one of the worst sessions in September. The SPY finished 2.35% down, the Nasdaq 3.05% down and the Dow finished 1.93% down. 

Tech shares reversed yesterday’s course and sank, leading the broader market down. Big tech stocks, like Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG) finished around 2% down on average. 

Economic analysts were mostly bearish. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note, “It’s also pretty clear that the rates of recovery have slowed, with only retail sales having completed the V. You can thank the enhanced unemployment benefits for that – $600 per week for more than 30M people, at the peak. It’s hard to be optimistic about September and the fourth quarter, with the chance of a further relief bill before the election receding as Washington focuses on the Supreme Court”.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin once again addressed the urgent need for further stimulus in a testimony before the House Financial Services Committee yesterday. Powell underscored the limitations of the Federal Reserve’s lending powers. He said, “Many borrowers will benefit from these programs, as will the overall economy. But for others, a loan that could be difficult to repay might not be the answer. In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed.” Mnuchin added that he wanted to reauthorize measures under the Payment Protection Program (PPP) that offered forgivable loans to businesses that stayed open and kept most of their employees on payroll. Unfortunately, any reauthorization or reallocation of funds requires Congressional approval, something unlikely to happen with lawmakers unable to come to a consensus about stimulus and focused mainly on the Supreme Court.

**Highlights**

* Yesterday was Tesla’s (TSLA) battery day. The company laid out plans to $25,000 car and cut battery costs in half over the next three years. However, this fell short of expectations of investors and analysts, who said “while the technology and manufacturing innovations outlined were impressive, Tesla’s valuation already priced in these disruptors”. The stock finished the day 10.34% down. 
* SPI Energy (SPI) rocketed today after the company announced they were launching a new electric vehicle subsidiary. Stock was up 3000% at one point before finishing the day 1,199% up. 
* Nike (NKE) shares spiked up today after the company’s earning announcement based on increased ecommerce sales. The stock finished the day 8.77% up.

2020-09-17 13:09:01,"Here is a MArket Recap for today, Sept 17, 2020. Please enjoy!"," **PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, Sept 17, 2020**

Stocks ended sharply down in a volatile trading session, as investors and traders became more cautious following the Federal Reserve’s announcement yesterday and conflicting information and timeframes regarding a potential coronavirus vaccine.

The sell-off was led by big tech stocks, like Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), and Apple (AAPL), which extended yesterday’s losses and soured overall market sentiment. It appears that after the historic rally in August and since the March bottom, traders are rethinking the prospects of a continued, sharp economic recovery in the face of no additional fiscal stimulus. The volatility this month highlights the effects this still-raging pandemic has on the economy. 

Another 860,000 workers filed for unemployment claims this week, with claims remaining below 1 million for a third straight week. The number of unemployed persons also fell below 13 million, an encouraging sign for a recovering labor market.  

Fed officials upgraded their economic projections for this year, and now anticipate a shallower decline in real GDP and a lower unemployment rate by year-end versus their early-summer projections. Still, officials suggested that the quicker-than-expected early economic recovery could be jeopardized in absence of further fiscal stimulus. Powell said, “It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that.” Again, Powell is urging Congressional lawmakers to pass additional fiscal stimulus.

The expiration of the CARES Act and enhanced unemployment benefits have left millions of Americans unemployed and without support in the middle of a pandemic. While the stock market is okay (relatively), Powell and other FOMC members have stressed the financial burden this pandemic has placed on small businesses and individuals, urging Congress to pass more fiscal stimulus. 

President Trump agrees with Powell and on Wednesday called on congressional Republicans to support a massive economic relief bill with “much higher numbers” and stimulus payments for Americans, abruptly proposing an entirely different plan from what the Senate GOP sought to advance in recent days. Trump advocated for the $1.5 trillion plan unveiled by the bipartisan house committee, the Problem Solvers Caucus.  The proposal includes a new round of $1,200 stimulus checks to individual Americans, a provision omitted from an approximately $300 billion plan Senate Republicans tried unsuccessfully to pass last week. Pres. Trump said, “I like the larger amount, I’ve said that. Some of the Republicans disagree, but I think I can convince them to go along with that because I like the larger number. I want to see people get money.”

Trump’s claim yesterday that a coronavirus vaccine could be ready by November went against statements made the same day by Robert Redfield, the head of the CDC. Redfield said he does not expect a vaccine to be ‘widely available’ until the third quarter of next year. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows responded by saying “not sure where Dr. Redfield got his particular timetable, but it’s not based on those that are closest to the process.” In response, the WHO said, “It is important  we have consistent messaging by officials worldwide”.

In an unfortunate development, WHO officials warned that the spread of coronavirus in Europe now is worse than it was in March, near the start of the pandemic. Europe has reported 300,000 cases in one week, the highest 7-day total since the start of the pandemic. In total, Europe has reported about 4.9 million coronavirus cases and 226,524 deaths.

Stocks rose today, reversing course after being deep in the red the last two days. Market participants digested a record increase in third-quarter GDP for the US, a better-than-expected weekly unemployment report, new coronavirus restrictions in the US and Europe and a slew of corporate earnings for massive companies.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 1.75% today, the best performing of the major indices. The S&P 500 (SPY) finished 1.05% up and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.44%.

After coming off one of the worst quarters in US history, the economy rebounded, growing at its fastest pace ever. Gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of the total goods and services produced from July to September of this year, expanded at a 33.1% annualized pace, according to the report by the Department of Commerce. The gain came after a 31.4% plunge in the second quarter and was better than the 32% estimate from economists surveyed by Dow Jones. The previous record was the post-World War II 16.7% surge in the first quarter of 1950.

Today, the US Department of Commerce released its weekly unemployment report, showing that another 751,000 individuals filed initial jobless claims, better than the 770,000 estimated by analysts.  Continuing claims, which refer to individuals that are currently receiving unemployment benefits who filed for unemployment benefits at least two weeks ago, was 7.75 million, slightly better than the 7.77 million expected. According to Yahoo Finance, this report represents the ninth-straight week initial unemployment claims have remained below 1 million and continuing claims below 10 million, a key indicator that the economy is recovering, though not as fast as many would like.

In Europe, countries are still struggling to contain the recent surge in coronavirus infections. Both France and Germany announced renewed lockdowns spanning for about the next month, though the restrictions stopped short of the draconian measures announced earlier on during the pandemic. In the US, the seven-day average of daily new cases rose to a record 70,000 as of yesterday, according to data compiled by the Washington Post.

On the vaccine front, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, said he believed it would take until at least January for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to authorize a COVID-19 vaccine. There are five companies (Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Moderna (MRNA), Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (ELY), and BioNTech (BNTX)) in the final stages of study for a coronavirus vaccine, with Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. having fully enrolled their trials, Fauci said.

Some analysts consider the recent pull-back in the stock market a healthy inevitability, given the strong rally that took many stocks to all-time highs earlier in the Month. Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, said in a note to clients, “Markets have been baking in a lot of optimism: that the pandemic was under control, that the economy was healing, and that things would be back to something approaching normal in 2021. Those assumptions were always optimistic, though, and what we are seeing now is a reality-based repricing. As such, this drop is both necessary and healthy. Markets should reflect the most likely future path, not the most optimistic, and that is where we are headed.”

2020-10-07 15:07:39,Market Recap - Wed Oct 7 Please Enjoy!,"**Summary**

Stocks were on a run today, climbing steadily higher all the way into close, fueled by hope stemming from President Trump’s tweets on the push to approve $1,200 checks and support for Airlines.

The SPY finished up 1.73%, the QQQ up 1.8%, and the DIA up 1.85%. Additionally the small cap IWM is up 2.18% for the day, and the Biotech etf IBB closed up 2.22%.

Yesterday in the early afternoon, Trump announced that he would stop all Stimulus talks until after the election. The markets saw a very significant slide off, only recouping a bit of the losses by the close. However, later in the day, going back on his word he made two significant tweets which helped to push the markets higher today. “If I am sent a Stand Alone Bill for Stimulus Checks ($1,200), they will go out to our great people IMMEDIATELY. I am ready to sign right now. Are you listening Nancy?” and the second was about the airlines “The House & Senate should IMMEDIATELY Approve 25 Billion Dollars for Airline Payroll Support, & 135 Billion Dollars for Paycheck Protection Program for Small Business. Both of these will be fully paid for with unused funds from the Cares Act. Have this money. I will sign now!”

During today, Speaker Pelosi conducted an interview on ABC’s “The View” where she signaled willingness to keep discussions open, but disparaged the idea of stand-alone bills. She continues to support the idea that a one comprehensive package in the order of $2 Trillion must be passed in whole. House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth said “We don’t have time to save the economy piece by piece. As Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told us, we need to act now and act big”.

It is worth noting Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, and Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin have constantly been advocating that with all the Fed has done, still more direct stimulus from Congress is needed to aid with the recovery. Many feel it is unfortunate to see that the stimulus has become a ground to push political agendas, while the ones who pay the price are the regular American citizens.

Tonight there will be a vice presidential debate between Kamala Harris, and current VP Mike Pence. According to a report published by Marketwatch the stakes will be high as ""Vice President Pence must put in a strong performance against the democratic nominee, Sen Kamala Harris of California, to turn the electorate's attention away from the first presidential debate and a barrage of negative news coverage related to Trump's recent COVID-19 diagnosis and subsequent hospitalization"".

On other fronts, hotspots for Coronavirus are picking up, with the latest restrictions coming from New York. The rule will come into effect on Friday and will affect businesses, houses of worships and schools. Boston has also delayed the reopening of schools for a week. India is closing in on the US to become the country with most infections, adding 78k new cases, more than double of the US, to total 6.8M vs the 7.7M total cases in the US.

Vaccine developments continue to move forward with the White House and FDA finally on agreement on the guidelines to approve for Emergency use. Also, During the John Hopkins University Vaccine Symposium, Operation Warp Speed Chief says within next month or two ""We feel comfortable"" that we will have one or two efficacious candidates to deliver doses to 30M people by Nov or Dec 2020 as per reports on the event by Benzinga. The story on Trump’s recovery is that he has been treated with a cocktail with treatments from GILD and REGN and is currently recuperating presenting mild to no symptoms according to a report by CNBC.

Pretty good companies, don't get me wrong, but I feel the current valuations are a bit crazy.

Not going to lie, I'm a bit nervous since I believe in most of the companies (ENPH I hope our paths cross again), but not in the valuations and the current status of the economy. Took a very nice >30% profit, and I'm still DCA'ing my ETFs but this is it for me for this run.

The remaining 25% is basically FB, DIS, CCL and BABA, which I'm more confortable with the current valuations.

Bear gang, treat me well. Good luck to everyone.

UPDATE: I could have avoided saying this (more so after all the fuzz)... but it wouldn't be fair: After reading ALL comments and further thought, instead of directly selling I've set an stop loss of about 5-15% in all the mention, that I will be updating every other day.

2018-11-15 15:10:06,Why I think $FB will buy $SPOT soon.,"Looking at FB, it is currently sitting on a boatload of cash. Looking at SPOT, it is right now reasonably priced at $25B and losing cash.


With FB's margins, they are able to eat SPOT's current losses and ensure Spotify's mission of capturing market share. 

Also, the sentiment around FB has been pretty ugly. They have only been in the news when they're being attacked for their use of consumer data. I think an acquisition at this level could reverse sentiment as it would signify FB's aggressive approach to future acquisitions and an attempt to diversify their offering.

GOOG, AAPL, AMZN, NFLX, FB are all focused right now on one thing - capturing and retaining consumer's attention. I could see Spotify become an arm for content creation for FB: music, audiobooks, podcasts, news - you name it. Spotify has the clean UI and subscription business model to be a one stop shop for those media.

I also think SPOT is a fantastic fit into FB's overall suite, and would fuel their mission of uniting the world. Heck, music is the world's language.


I'd be interested to see what you all think. Thoughts?",14,0.68

Me, I say no, it’s not overvalued. Lots of tech is overvalued atm imo, but not fangam. Yes we’ve been correcting for 2 weeks now but I consider it a healthy dip, not a dump. These companies are extremely profitable and still growing even after the incredible run up wvebe seen the last decade. Apple and Microsoft are and will continue to be my biggest holdings in my portfolio other than spy, and I see no reason to change that any time soon. Microsoft IMO is the best company in the world, especially the last 5 years under Nadella. Apple at this point is a consumer staple.

2020-09-22 13:46:35,"Here is a Market Recap for today, Sept 22. Enjoy!"," **PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, Sept 22, 2020**

Stocks traded choppily before rising in another very volatile session, with traders weighing uncertainty around the presidential election, a worsening coronavirus situation in Europe, and concerns that fiscal stimulus will not come in near-term.  The Nasdaq outperformed, rose 1.86% as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) increased. The S&P finished 1.02% and the Dow finished the day 0.5% up.

The coronavirus situation in Europe has greatly worsened, with experts and politicians warning that a second-wave is around the corner. On September 12, French authorities reported 10,000 COVID-19 cases in one day for the first time since the pandemic began. Since then, daily cases have soared to more than 13,000. Several ""red zones"", cities considered high risk, have seen clampdowns. There is much talk of a second national lockdown in the UK, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson announcing that there will be further restrictive measures aimed at containing another major outbreak, as the number of cases swells and top scientists warn that the death rate could grow exponentially. On Monday, the UK reported 4,368 new cases. In Spain, parts of the capital Madrid, saw new lockdown measures enforced on Monday. More than 850,000 residents face restrictions on travel and the size of gatherings, according to Al Jazeera. The EU CDC reported that in Spain, there were 300 cases of COVID-19 per every 100,000 people as the capital of Madrid saw new lockdown measures being enforced.

Prospects of more fiscal stimulus passing before the November election have dimmed, with Congress unable to come to a consensus. Today, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Fed Chair Jerome Powell testified before the House Financial Services Committee. They said that the Fed and Treasury can only go ‘so far so fast’ and cannot replace targeted aid from Congress. “The recovery will go faster if we have both tools \[from the Fed and Congress\] continuing to work together,"" Powell said. Both Powell and Mnuchin credited the Cares Act for helping the economy recover at the height of the pandemic but have once again stressed to Congressional lawmakers the importance of targeted, fiscal aid in helping families and small businesses through these tough times.

A lot of people are looking for the hot, sexy young stock that will beat the market and double within 5 years, but sometimes the best plays are also the most obvious. It's easy to believe ""small company will grow faster than big company"" but the large cap growth companies have economies of scale and extremely high amounts of capital to invest in both their products and expanding their market share. They also have stability, great management and brand recognition, which breeds investor confidence and makes people feel safe entrusting their money to them.

This also suggests that index funds may be safe and diversified, but if a blue chip growth company is worthy of your confidence, you're potentially better off not over-diversifying away your returns. Note: if any one of these companies completely failed and fell off the map somehow, assuming no impact one way or another to the others, the total returns of the other two would still have beaten SPY WITH that company included by a significant amount - even if the vanished company was Microsoft, the biggest returner.

**EDIT:**

I will be posting a longer term analysis shortly following this methodology back historically using the top 3 US market cap companies based on the Q1 values of the [Financial Times Global 500 each year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization). I compare buying and holding $1000 worth of shares of each of the top 3 companies each year since 1996 (when the Global 500 started) on market open Jan 1st of that year vs. buying and holding $3000 worth of SPY on the same day, with no dividend reinvestments either way. Following this methodology:

Cash basis: $75,000 (25 years x $3000)

The ""Big 3"" portfolio: $199,445

SPY portfolio: $165,164

This is including buying and holding declining behemoths like GE, CSCO and XOM which are lower today than when they were at the top.

* US equities lower in Friday midday trading. Comes after US equities rebounded on Thursday from a big Wednesday selloff. However, S&P on pace for worst week since early September, Nasdaq since March. Weakness largely chalked up to renewed coronavirus concerns, election uncertainty and lack of fiscal stimulus. All sectors lower with tech (AAPL-US ), consumer discretionary (AMZN-US ) trailing. Healthcare, financials, comm services (GOOGL-US ) faring somewhat better. Treasuries little changed to a bit weaker in belly of the curve. Dollar little changed on the major crosses. Gold up 0.6%. WTI crude down 1.8%, on pace for \~11% weekly decline, worst since late April.
* **Big tech results have received a lot of the blame for the pullback** even though the group reported beat on revenue and EPS and there did not seem to be any meaningful shift in the very upbeat fundamental and secular growth narratives. In terms of some of the sticking points, **AAPL-US** missed on iPhone sales and the later iPhone 12 launch weighed on China, **AMZN-US** guided Q4 operating income below on another $4B of coronavirus investments and **FB-US** highlighted looming risks surrounding engagement, platform changes and regulatory. **GOOGL-US** has bucked the trend with the focus on an ad spending recovery, expense control and upcoming cloud disclosures.
* Busy earnings outside of big tech. **SBUX-US** beat and saw sequential comp improvement. **SYK-US** saw continued recovery in elective procedures but no guidance. **ATVI-US** beat but Q4 EPS guidance missed. **TEAM-US** revenue growth decelerated. **TWTR-US** beat on ad strength but mDAUs missed and it guided for higher costs. **CVNA-US** missed slightly on retail units. **HIG-US** beat on better margins. **FIVN-US** beat and raised on enterprise momentum. **DECK-US** had a big beat on strength in UGG and HOKA. **COLM-US** missed and guided below. **DVN-US** raised production guidance. **CAKE-US** beat and said comps have improved in Q4.
* Nothing particularly incremental surrounding some of the higher-profile themes outside of earnings. **Worsening coronavirus trends** in Europe and US continue to grab a lot of headlines and have raised concerns about recovery headwinds. **Election uncertainty** another overhang as Biden's lead in the polls offset by the potential for Trump to deliver another 2016 surprise. **Fiscal stimulus** on the backburner other than the seeming breakdown in the Pelosi-Mnuchin relationship. **Central bank policy support** another area of focus following the ECB though there also continue to be worries about both depleted arsenals and fatigue.

**Notable Gainers:**

* \+6.2% **RMD-US** (ResMed): FQ1 earnings and revenue beat; noted sequential improvement in core apnea patient volume; analysts positive on better-than-expected sleep improvement amid declining Covid ventilator tailwinds; upgraded at JP Morgan.
* \+4.4% **ZEN-US** (Zendesk): Q3 EPS, revenue beat; billings, deferred revenue, cash from operations all better; guided Q4 revenue, operating income ahead of estimates; upgraded to buy from hold at Stifel, citing multi-year wave of digital upgrades in marketing, support.
* \+4.2% **GOOGL-US** (Alphabet): Big Q3 beat driven by increase in advertiser spend in Search and YouTube, along with continued strength in Google Cloud and Play; takeaways noted YouTube ad growth back near pre-pandemic levels (DR strong and brand spending rebounded); expense control another bright spot; Street also positive on company's plan to provide more disclosure on Google Cloud revenue and profitability.
* \+3% **FLEX-US** (Flex): Fiscal Q2 results ahead with company highlighting a coronavirus tailwind for health solutions, a rebound in auto, industrial growth from power solutions and renewables, and better networking and cloud growth (helped offset enterprise IT weakness); guidance ahead of expectations; Street also positive on update on NEXTracker solar business ($1B+ revenues and double digit operating margins).
* \+2.5% **CL-US** (Colgate-Palmolive): Q3 EPS, revenue beat; organic growth ahead on big Latin America, Europe upside; guided net and organic sales up MSD against consensus for 2.1% growth; also guided GM ahead; analysts noted GM expansion a record which allowed strong brand investments.
* \+2.4% **FIVN-US** (Five9): Q3 EPS, EBITDA, revenue beat on billings upside; announced acquisition of Inference Solutions, terms not disclosed; guided Q4 revenue midpoint ahead, EPS slightly better; upgraded to overweight from equal-weight at Stephens, citing improve revenue growth visibility, faster mid-market/enterprise adoption.
* \+1.6% **UAA-US** (Under Armour): Q3 revenue, operating income, EPS all ahead; guided FY20 EPS, revenue ahead of Street; management also highlighted margin growth vs 2019 on channel mix benefits, supply chain efficiencies; analysts positive on MyFitnessPal spinoff as sign of focus on core business, management focus on brand elevations and profitability.

**Notable Decliners:**

* \-19.5% **TWTR-US** (Twitter): Q3 earnings and revenue beat on stronger advertising though monetizable daily active users sharply missed heightened expectations; noted favorable trends continued through October; analysts highlighted delay of MAP offering into 2021 due to new privacy standards, increased cost commentary for Q4 and pull forward of users during Q1/Q2.

* \-9.3% **TEAM-US** (Atlassian): FQ1 earnings and revenue beat; new-customer growth and billings among the bright spots; next-Q guidance a bit weaker than the Street; analysts noted report generally positive but concerns about decelerating growth and lumpiness amid cloud transition.
* \-7.5% **MGM-US** (MGM Resorts): Q3 EPS and revenue missed; analysts characterized Las Vegas results as soft though Macau better; noted LV strip recovery remains highly uncertain due to reliance on air travel and group/convention business.
* \-6.1% **FB-US** (Facebook): Q3 beat big on key metrics with recovery in demand for digital ads the widely discussed tailwind on SMB, eComm, Retail, CPG strength; however, US and Canada users down and company warned they could fall more in Q4; also highlighted risks surrounding privacy changes, regulatory environment; guidance for a big investment ramp another overhang.
* \-5.3% **AAPL-US** (Apple): Sep Q revenue and EPS ahead but upside limited, iPhone revenue missed, China soft and company did not provide revenue guidance; however, other products beat (WFH tailwind) and company was positive on early iPhone 12 read-throughs; Street noted lack of guidance more of a supply issue, still expects a very powerful upgrade cycle and continued to talk up the favorable ecosystem narrative.

2018-09-18 05:00:38,$FB: good time to buy more and lower avg costs? Or is that money better off somewhere else?,"So here's a short description of what happened.

Before Q2 earnings I got all hyped up about FB and bought 5 shares @ $216.

The stock crashed to 200 immediately. Thinking I'm smart that I didn't invest ""a lot"", I bought 5 more @ $201. And then the stock made one of the greatest plunges in history. 
Determined that this was the time it stabilizes, I bought in 7 shares @ 176.

So now I have 17 shares @194.78 and the stock keeps falling. I'm -$610 (18%) as of today.


So far I've already put $3311 which represents a good chunk of my investments (~$15k).

My cumulative portfolio growth including the 600 dollar loss is +28% (~$3.5k)


Do you guys advice me putting in more money @158 (~2k) to average my cost to about $180? 
If not, is there any other ""hot stock"" that could be the ""next AMD""? 

So far, all I've looked at are stocks that are a good hold but not a good buy. Is there anything I may have missed?

Thanks!

P.S. I'm fairly new to investing and I'm mostly investing based on market emotion and hype.

I'm just trying to make sure my by with FB isn't biased as it was back then with BBRY.

**- BBRY h**ad a healthy balance sheet, although they had APPLE and then android as new competitors to the smartphone market. BBRY was a dominant position in smart phone market. Rest is history they tanked.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/FGCngSy6/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/FGCngSy6/)

I took long position on FB after the recent drop after earnings. Got in at 177, flipped it at 185. Re-established position at 180.

**- FB** has a healthy balance sheet. No new competitors to social media space. Dominant position in social media space. They tanked because guidance for future was negative, due to increased spending, not necessarily tied to revenue generation.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/xmlr4Q56/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/xmlr4Q56/)

Belief

* I believe FB is different from BBRY because I believe this drop is more of a investor over reaction versus a fundamental change to the social media advertising space.
* The reaction is due to the guidance that fb will be spending more money, not necessarily earning less.
* No new players to the market place, unless advertisers are moving towards twitter instead of facebook or instagram. Google still has a play in the advertising space, that is competitive with facebook. Are there new players?
* If consumers are spending less due to lack of disposable income, would advertisers spend more to try and get more customers? OR would advertisers spend less because they're aware they have a decrease in sales due to poor market conditions, so they'd save their advertising budget for a healthier economy?

2020-09-10 03:21:33,2 reasons fears of a dot-com style tech bubble are overblown,"Mega-cap tech stocks like Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL?p=AAPL&.tsrc=fin-srch)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN?p=AMZN&.tsrc=fin-srch)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT&.tsrc=fin-srch)), Facebook ([FB](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB?p=FB&.tsrc=fin-srch)), and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA?p=TSLA&.tsrc=fin-srch)) (if you consider that a tech stock) have been hammered over the past few days, pulling down the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq. 

During late afternoon trading Tuesday, Tesla was down nearly 20% amid news that it won’t be part of the S&P 500. Meanwhile, Facebook was down nearly 4%, Amazon and Microsoft over 4%, and Apple over 5%. And on Tuesday, workplace collaboration app Slack ([WORK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WORK/)) saw its stock plummet over 15% in after-hours trading [following a disappointing earnings report](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/slack-second-quarter-earnings-work-from-home-202052097.html).

That’s led to rumblings that the market — which has been bounced around by these and other massive tech names — is careening toward a second coming of the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s that came crashing down 20 years ago. That era was best epitomized by Pets.com, which, despite a flashy advertising campaign, flamed out just 9 months after its initial public offering.

 But according to Capital Economics’ senior markets economist Oliver Jones, the rapid growth in tech stocks is different from the dot-com bubble for two reasons — most big-name tech stocks are fundamentally sound companies, and, despite recent volatility, tech stocks have provided a safe haven as other industries have faltered amid the pandemic.

## Tech firms are delivering on fundamentals

[As Jones writes in a research note](https://www.capitaleconomics.com/clients/publications/capital-daily/capital-daily-publication/what-options-can-tell-us-about-the-latest-swings-in-stock-markets/?tk=c63709907946e8cbf7b30754fbfa76d993088517), one of the key differences between the dot-com bubble and the current Big Tech market leaders is that, unlike many of those first-generation websites that took off, firms like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft have solid fundamentals.

“While options market shenanigans may have contributed a bit lately, the main catalyst for their rally is simply the fact that their businesses have done extremely well, in both absolute and relative terms, during the coronavirus crisis. That has not changed in the past week,” Jones wrote in note.

The tech firms aren’t just making money — they’re doing so on a sustained basis and cruising past their prior year earnings even amid a global pandemic crippling other parts of the economy.

“Bears will start to make comparisons to the \[dot-com bubble\] of the late nineties,” David Nelson, chief strategist of Belpointe Asset Management, wrote in a note Tuesday. “As a veteran of that war I can tell you there's little resemblance. While valuations are stretched most of the big cap secular growth stocks are profitable. That was not the case in 2000.”

 Take Apple. [In the second quarter of 2020](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-q2-earnings-2020-203115363.html), the pandemic shuttered production facilities in China and then forced it to close stores around the world outside of Mainland China. The company still managed to increase revenue year-over-year by 1% to $58.3 billion. [In Q3 2020](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-q3-earnings-2020-203224360.html), the company saw revenue grow 11% year-over-year to $59.7 billion.

Amazon and Microsoft, meanwhile, have already been on a roll thanks to the performance of their cloud platforms as the pandemic spurs demand for such services. Amazon, of course, has also benefited immensely thanks to its positioning as a lifeline for essential goods when many people were stuck in their homes in the early portion of the pandemic.

Google’s parent Alphabet was the outlier, with revenue decreasing year-over-year [in Q2 2020](https://www.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-googl-q2-earnings-revenues-214509856.html) by 2%, partly due to a pullback in ad sales.

## The tech industry has been a bright spot despite recent volatility

Those performance metrics come as entire swaths of the economy have been decimated by the coronavirus pandemic including the hotel business and airlines. STR, [a data analytics firm for the hospitality industry](https://str.com/press-release/str-us-hotel-results-week-ending-29-august), found the U.S. hotel occupancy was down 27% year-over-year for the week ending Aug. 29. What’s more, revenue per room was off 44.5%.

The airline industry has laid off thousands, as consumers either avoid airports entirely or are unable to travel internationally. Airlines including American ([AAL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAL?p=AAL&.tsrc=fin-srch)), Delta ([DAL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DAL?p=DAL&.tsrc=fin-srch)), and United ([UAL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/UAL?p=UAL&.tsrc=fin-srch)) have even gone as far as to eliminate change fees on domestic flights to further entice consumers to fly.

The restaurant industry has been similarly impacted by the virus, first by shutdowns and then by an inability to host in-door dining in some states.

As Jones explains, there’s little else for investors to be excited about outside of Big Tech. According to his note, there’s been no surge in call options for equity indices, indicating investors were willing to buy, while there has been a slight increase in put volumes, indicating investors are willing to sell if the price is right.

“This suggests that investors’ primary concern has been protecting themselves against broad-based weakness, the opposite of the caution-to-the-wind behavior you might expect to see in a bubble,” he wrote.

In other words, investors have likely been looking at tech as a safe haven while other industries struggled amid the pandemic. Now, they’re looking to claim the profits they’ve earned in the interim.

So don’t break out those Pets.com sock puppets just yet.

2020-09-29 13:33:28,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, Sept 29. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, September 29, 2020**

Stocks traded choppily today, as traders considered a new stimulus proposal from lawmakers, the presidential debate this evening, and an increase in Covid-19 infections.

Market action today highlights the extreme volatility of today’s market. After a day of green yesterday, the major indices experienced several intraday reversals. The Dow (DIA) finished 0.53% down, the S&P 500 finished 0.5#% down as well, and the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.45% down.

The House Democrats recently announced a new $2.2 trillion stimulus package, offering a sliver of hope that Congress might take action to help buoy the pandemic-stricken economy before the November elections. There is still a large divide between the Democrats proposal and the $1-1.5 trillion that is estimated to be the Republicans cap. Many analysts and economists are skeptical that a deal will be passed, leaving potential for market disappointment. On a more positive front, Pelosi and Mnuchin are scheduled to hold a meeting to discuss economic relief. Let’s hope they are able to work something out. 

This evening is the first of three presidential debates between Pres. Trump and Joe Biden in Cleveland, Ohio at 9pm ET. Last week the Commission on Presidential Debates announced that some topics set to be discussed are the “Trump and Biden’s records, the Supreme Court, Covid-19, the economy, race and violence in our cities, the integrity of the election.” Market participants will be closely watching each candidate's stance and agenda for dealing with the economy.

Sadly, the pandemic’s death toll has surpassed 200,000 in the United States, with 7.19 million people infected, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. Today, the American Academy of Pediatrics announced that children and teenagers now make up 10% up cases in the US, up from 2% in April, a worrying increase. The Central for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that “incidence of COVID-19 in school-age children began rising in early September as many youngsters returned to their classrooms.”
