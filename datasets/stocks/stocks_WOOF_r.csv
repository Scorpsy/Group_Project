2021-04-05 12:03:45,['WOOF'],Anyone holding Petco (WOOF)? It’s being shorted over %26 for some reason. I like the potential.,Petco has recently implemented some changes to their business model and just recently cut out raw hides from their stores. I like where they are going with the company. It’s trading very low at the moment and with their online business really picking up momentum I think Petco is going places in the foreseen future.,127,0.72
