2021-04-01 02:10:08,['ON'],A good industrial long term position? HON DD MMM,"I recently took a small position in UNP to veer away from my heavy tech portfolio.  

I've been eyeing a few industrials to try and average in slowly as long term positions.

I was wondering what people's thoughts were on HON DD or MMM to put in my ROTH to help diversify a little.

I'm leaning to HON.  Is it expensive right now?

It looks like DD and MMM seem the most ""beat up"" though.  Maybe higher short term upside?

Reopening plays?

Thanks",4,1.0
