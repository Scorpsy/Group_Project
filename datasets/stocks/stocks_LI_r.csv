How does it play a factor in taxes?

I Googled around but I just cant wrap my head around it. If I took a 1k loss in trading stock ABC but buy it again within the time limit, I understand my brokerage raises the cost basis to reflect the wash, but if I end up making money from stock ABC, why does the wash sale still affect the price/share, since I am no longer able to use it to write off my taxes since I no longer took a loss?",2,1.0

PAVE has a higher expense ratio but showed better growth compared to XLI. XLI top 10 holdings are also dubiously not very industrial related compared to PAVE (eg. 3 of the 10 are just defence/aerospace companies).,2,0.76
