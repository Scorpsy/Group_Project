2021-03-31 14:00:21,XL Fleet $XL WHY ARE THEY DOWN SO MUCH?!?,"They just announced earnings and they reported 182% increase in revenue. I understand they aren't anticipating future revenue for 2021, but honestly I think that may be a smart idea? A lot of companies are facing chip shortages, and a few companies have also over estimated their revenue and their shares tanked. 

But for XL to be shot down this hard?!? I'm not an expert but the short ration according to finviz is currently at 0.85. Picture attached. How is this happening? Can anyone explain this to me?!
