2021-03-10 20:35:37,What do I do with 17% combined MSFT AAPL allocation?,"After only a year I've managed to make AAPL and MSFT about 17% of my portfolio.  Combined I'm up about 25% across the two so I'm not sure what percentage they started as.

I'm not stressing about it, as I feel they are solid companies, however I'm unsure what to do as (hopefully) they become a larger percentage of my portfolio.

They are in taxable, so trimming them now would create short gains, so I'd rather wait till they become long term.

Do I eventually trim them back to 5% each or do I trim less, to say 2.5% and let them build again to 5% or do I just let them keep growing in hopes that my other holdings catch up or outpace? Or does it really matter lol?",16,0.8

2021-03-02 09:42:13,MSFT + BB = Dominant Car OS vender,"  

# Microsoft should acquire BlackBerry

TLDR: MSFT wants what GOOL and AAPL have – Android and iOS. Windows is shit. Buying BB makes MSFT instant dominant car OS vender.

# Software defined vehicle

Much like the evolution of cell phones. You used to buy new flip phones in order to get new features, now hardware and software on smart phones are updated separately. Vehicles are the next app platform. Vehicle software will be the next frontier for innovation. Every major player will want to sell you apps, services, and show you ads in your car. Unlike smart phones, Microsoft has not lost the battle in software defined vehicle space yet. The time for Microsoft to do something about it is now, and the fastest way to get a foot in the door is by acquiring BB. 

How much is each smart connected car worth to social media, ad platforms, cloud service platforms, etc.? A quick web search “social network value per user” says Facebook will generate $226 per user in the U.S. in 2021. Let’s say each U.S. driver is worth additional $50 to Facebook per year, $150 to all other social media and ad platforms combined. I’m being extremely conservative here; car users are captive audiences while phone users often are not. Users should worth more to social media companies when they’re in the car. The U.S. alone has over 270 million vehicles. That’s half a trillion total addressable market. That is just social media in the U.S., how about services and other apps we don’t know we need yet? All in, this can easily be a multi-trillion-dollar market. We haven’t even touched commercial vehicles and taxis yet.

# Microsoft needs a secure real-time OS that’s not Windows.

Microsoft and Ford’s Sync is an embarrassment to both Ford and Microsoft – source I bought my first and last Ford about 10 years ago. Ford kicked Microsoft to the curb in favor of QNX sometime ago. Ford is replacing QNX with Android from Google. Microsoft needs to redeem itself with Azure Cloud connected infotainment system running on a secure real-time OS. A proven secure platform is going to pitch well against Android and Linux based systems.

Apple has CarPlay and Google has Android Auto, and Microsoft is practically absent in infotainment space. CarPlay and most instances of Android Auto runs on QNX based systems. More specifically they rely on QNX’s Projection system. Basically, the apps run on your phone, and “project” the display via QNX and QNX sends control signals (touch screen, button press, etc.) to the phone app. If you’re huge company who wants a piece of the car software pie, but no one uses your Windows phone, what can you do? You can bundle your software with the car! Build it into the car’s OS, for free! 

Microsoft would love to pull another Internet Explorer vs Netscape Navigator if they can control the car OS. Only in this case Apple and Google are not the underdog Netscape was. Apple and Tesla will do their own thing, but for the majority of auto makers who already use QNX, the easy thing to do is keep using QNX if it is good enough and backed by MSFT’s engineering power. A MSFT own QNX can even be free or less than free.

# Monolithic Kernel vs Micro Kernel

Microsoft Windows is not suitable for cars, and it can’t be fixed. BlackBarry’s QNX Neutrino RTOS, based on microkernel architecture, is inherently more secure than monolithic kernel such as Linux. Microsoft Windows has hybrid kernel and by some measures has worse security track record. When your email, IM, and text can be shown on your car’s screen or read aloud via your car’s audio system. Security will be a major concern for consumers and government agencies. Microsoft owned QNX has a real chance of dominating Android and upcoming Apple Car OS.

# Conclusion

I see increasing chatter about MSFT may benefit from a BB acquisition so I did some DD before start buying BB stock. I believe after MSFT lost the smart phone battle, car software and OS are MSFT’s once in a generation second chance. BB enterprise value is about 6 billion. I can see MSFT spend 20+ billion in stock and cash to buy BB. I write code for a living and thinks he understands markets he has little to no knowledge of. I’m not a financial advisor. I spent a lot of my time on GitHub and various programming chatrooms. I may have read something on the web that give me this idea, or it may be all in my head. I honestly can’t tell. I do not have any direct or indirect knowledges pertinent to MSFT and BB’s technical or management decisions. Invest at your own risk.

2021-02-20 13:00:13,Which automaker will be the MSFT of EV?,"I am a big believer in EV, and I think we will see amazing innovation within the industry and faster than expected adoption. In the end, EV is an inevitable part of the green agenda. But how can we as investors capitalize on this trend without jumping into interestingly valued companies and EV startups. 

Yes, I am aware of Tesla and a ton of other EV companies with huge rockets behind their stock price. I have had positions in those companies. However, I can’t wrap my head around the fact that some investors believe that traditional automakers are out of the game. Some people make it sound like they are sitting on their hands watching their market share disappear. Moreover, investors are investing like it will be a winner takes all market. That’s not gonna happen. 

Now, back to the title of this post and my original question. Which automaker will be the MSFT of EV companies?

If any of you remember Steve Ballmer and pre-Nadella times at MSFT. Cloud and SaaS was the name of the game, and MSFT was lagging heavily. All the cool kids on the block looked down on MSFT with comments like: “They have too much legacy, they can’t turn the ship around”. Well, they did. From 30 ish stock price to 240 today. Their future has never looked brighter. So, I feel the same sentiment towards traditional automakers and the EV revolution. But one of them will surely do a MSFT move, but which one? Any ideas and discussions regarding my thesis are appreciated.",21,0.74

the feature: users will be able to sell their work for a cost on an hourly basis, while linkedin takes a percentage cut of the deal. as of 2019, according to forbes, 35% of US workers are freelancing and, according to statista, it is projected that freelancers will make up \~51% of the total US workforce.

some insights on linkedin's revenue overall:

* a portion of linkedin's revenue comes from ads. tapping into the freelance market could increase the userbase. boosted engagement + more advertising opportunity = more ad revenues
* linked in takes fees from HR departments by helping them find candidates. this is another way to potentially look for candidates by centralizing their screening process
* linkedin premium and memberships are additional sources of income. it's a growing platform with hundreds of millions of users, bring in $8.8bln in revenue for MSFT.

this is by no means DD, but i'd love to hear your thoughts. do you think MSFT can pull it off? will FVRR be cannibalized? buy the rumor and sell (or hold) through the news in september?

The short squeeze continues to crush short sellers while EVs & Hydrogen are on the move. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw all 3 major indexes finish the day down, with both the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/PspccJG) and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/rwB8b2z) losing .07% while the [SP500](https://ibb.co/qg7hSBb) dropped by .15% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/NYVtHtF) remained pretty flat in a build-up day for today as the stock market is going to be hit with numerous economic data and big earnings reports from [Apple](https://ibb.co/kqJ38mj) which is expected to have their first $100B quarter, Boeing, Facebook, Tesla & many others.

We saw almost 60% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/7kH7Zjv) advancing with some companies dropping below the 50-day moving average as only 4 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/x6pRR2P) finished in the green, with Communications & Real Estate gaining more than 1% while Energy was the biggest laggard dropping more than 2% despite being the leader of the bunch in the early morning.

We also saw large-cap growth [companies](https://ibb.co/3svx5md) leading the way while the rest of the groups were lagging behind as you can also see in the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/S3ChnhR) from yesterday, with most of the small & mid-caps losing ground while the FAANG, Tesla, Microsoft and some other big companies were keeping the markets steady.

In terms of economic data, we saw the November housing price [index](https://ibb.co/dG3FNCJ) coming in as expected with a 11% increase y/y, which was also supported by the Shiller [Index](https://ibb.co/5ndWrBz) which indicated a 9.5% increase over last year, the biggest increase we have seen in this economic data in more than 6 years.

We also saw the January [consumer](https://ibb.co/vxdYwYy) confidence coming in better than expected at 89.3 with most of the increase coming from the expectations that consumers have of things getting better in the near future as the re-opening goes along.

Meanwhile the Richmond FED manufacturing [survey](https://ibb.co/F6PzgFL) came in at 14, lower than the 19 we saw last month as we saw a decrease in shipments, capacity utilization & volume of new orders.

In some other stock market news, we saw a lot of highly shorted stocks rise yet again, with the forbidden one rose by more than 90% for the day and continuing with an additional 120% in after hours, while [Beyond Meat](https://ibb.co/rtQccJB) rose by 33% in early morning after announcing a partnership with [PepsiCo](https://ibb.co/wRL5s66) which is one of the biggest food companies in the world, as they will develop snack & beverage products that are plant-based.

We also saw the pot stocks rise again, with [Tilray](https://ibb.co/wpZGYPD) leading the way after some national agencies from France tagged them to supply products for experiments in France. Tilray has been on a huge run since the Aphria merger news, and the company still has a lot of upside potential left especially if the Biden administration manages to push some sort of legislation, even if it isn’t a full-legalization in the US.

The same hopes of future help from the current administration were also seen in the EV & Hydrogen [sectors](https://ibb.co/3TwmFNC), with a lot of names like WorkHorse, Lordstown, Nikola & many others rising significantly yesterday

Some big companies also reported yesterday, as we saw General Electric [beating](https://ibb.co/0jpB660) most of the estimates in early morning and giving better than expected guidance on future free cash flow, which is a very big thing for a dividend paying company which has been struggling in the past years, while [JNJ](https://ibb.co/vQwJh52) also beat expectations and guided for even better revenues and earnings for next year as they are expecting vaccine results by next week, which could be huge for the hole stock market.

We also received a couple of big earnings reports in after hours, with [Starbucks](https://ibb.co/x3jzxHb) reporting pretty much as expected, but this high valuations for the stocks don’t really allow for OK quarters, everything needs to be exceptional for the most of the stocks to grow into these big valuations.

On the other hand, we saw [Microsoft](https://ibb.co/z8htnJC) crushing expectations, beating by almost $0.40 and a beat of more than $2.5B on revenues hitting over $40B in revenues for the first time due to the big demand in cloud revenues with Azure growing revenues by 50%, even better than the 48% in the last quarter. Microsoft also [guided](https://ibb.co/FYkGRSw) for upside in the next quarter, as this was a sleeping giant just like most of the big FAANG names which were underperformers for the better part of the end of 2020.

Meanwhile the other big tech name that reported was [AMD](https://ibb.co/fnB4Zvw), which also beat expectations due to big growth in all-areas of their business. I’ll be making a Due Diligence in AMD probably later today as I really want to see what growth they have ahead as they continue to battle with Intel

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/ZhwtrgB) are mixed, with the Nasdaq leading the way as we also await MBA mortgage applications in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/3yGpYRj), but mostly expect to see what the FED announces later in the day, as they end the two-day meeting and it is very likely Powell & The FED will keep the interest rates close to 0% and remain very dovish, probably continuing the monthly $120B assets purchase program for the foreseeable future.

2020-11-22 17:02:27,"I draw with crayons so you don't have to. Last week I closed up 1.9% for the week. Here are my plays this week: FB, KR, MSFT, NVDA, SHOP.","r/Stocks, I've been tracking my performance the last several weeks by selling theta and occasionally entering share positions. I normally post in the Options sub-reddit but just like my portfolio that is diversified in 4 stocks, I'm diversifying where I post my plays. This week I have a few positions where I will be buying shares. I thought maybe you guys would like to see my plays.

**Here are the last 3 weeks of returns**

&#x200B;

|**Week**|Buying Power|Profit/Loss|Return|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|$75,000|$4,000|5%|
|2|$79,000|$1,600|2%|
|3|$81,000|$1,500|1.9%|

&#x200B;

**What am I doing?**

I do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 1 to 3 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own. As a backstory I nearly blew up my account doing WSB-style plays in March but have regained all of my account and then some running this strategy since April. What I do now is basically wheeling on weekly puts.

I watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays & levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.

&#x200B;

**Here's a few things regarding my strategy**

**1.** I don't do spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see spreads as a ""Theta Gang"" play and is still very high risk.

**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.

**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.

**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads, only put-selling!

Honestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.

# Open Positions From Last Week

**LULU:** 1x LULU 18 Dec 2020 PUT @ $310 strike. Currently up 45% on the play.

This is holding a lot of my buying power. I'm already up 45% on the play on the run-up it's had so far last week. Waiting for the last 40-50% profit might be laborious since the option will begin to lose theta & delta as the stock price increases. Up 45% in a few days why wait another 2 weeks for the remaining 40%? I will be looking to sell this option once it hits 60% profit or so.

# Chart Rules

**Pink Lines** = Trading range & channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.

**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.

# Master Plays This Week

**FB - Facebook**

Facebook has been on a slow and steady uptrend staying within the pink channel. It's tested support a couple times on weakness and bounced cleanly off them each time. Stock price at $269 (nice) is currently at the lower range of the uptrend channel. I think we'll see some continued momentum upward. If we get another re-test of some lows I think we will find some support at $260 and again at $250. IV is pretty low for facebook, so buying shares and selling weekly covered calls at 0.15 delta for a little extra premium might be better return than put-selling.

**Positions on the watch:**

Dec 18 $260 PUT sold to open. Premium collected: $610, return: 1.5% in 4 weeks.

Break-even price would be if the stock closes below $253.90 by December 18 (currently $270).

OR

100x shares

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**KR - Kroger**

Kroger has always been a boring stock. I've labeled in purple where Buffet announced his stake. The stock shot up after the news and has been range-bound staying between $31-$34 with a slight uptrend. I think KR will react somewhat similar to WMT's stock price with a slow and steady upward grind. If so, we are at the bottom of the channel looking for continued momentum upward. Kroger reports earnings in 2 weeks and might provide a little extra premium on some plays.

**Plays on the watch:**

Dec 11 $31.50 PUT sold to open. Premium Collected: $65, return: 2% in 3 weeks.

OR

IV is low again, so owning some shares and selling CC against might also be a good move.

&#x200B;

**MSFT - Microsoft**

Classic Microsoft, not really doing much until it does. This chart only displays the last 6 months, but zooming further out you will see MSFT only goes up, albeit rather slowly. Last 3 months it's been in a slight uptrend bouncing between the $200 and $215/220 levels. Currently at the bottom of the trend channel, and might see some continued momentum going up. Big time support at $200 if we do see a little dip.

**Positions on the watch:**

Dec 18 $200 strike PUT sold to open. Premium Collected: $240, return: 1.2% in 3 weeks.

OR

Buying shares and selling covered calls.

&#x200B;

**NVDA - Nvidia**

I am very bullish on NVDA in long-term. This is another ticker that will benefit as the world shifts even more-so on the tech side of things. They have been server revenue massively and they are no longer just a gaming chip company. Very bullish uptrend even if another round of covid quarantines and lockdowns hit. I think we can see this ticker re-test the $560 level and have another break-out. Otherwise we might see downtrend back to $500 or $510.

**Positions on the watch:**

Options are pretty expensive here. Best play in my opinion is to be purchasing shares outright.

&#x200B;

**SHOP - Shopify**

Shopify has been within the same range since June. A few times it almost broke out of the $100 level, but was pulled right back in. The stock price is sitting at the lower end of the uptrend channel and close to the $1,000 support/resistance. If it breaks through this time look for some confirmation up above and into the $1,100 zone. I do like e-commerce long-term and think SHOP is at the very top of this list when you think e-commerce.

**Positions on the watch:**

Options here are also very expensive, I think I might purchase some shares and look for a quick 3-4% pop this or next week.

I'll be posting an update tomorrow morning with more potential theta plays and what I've entered.

2021-01-25 05:04:35,Stock Market News for Today | PLTR / GM / AAPL / TSLA / FB / MSFT & Other Stock Market News [01-25],"**Stocks close out the week with big gains as Big Tech comes back in flavor. The earnings frenzy starts with Apple, Tesla, Facebook & Microsoft reporting. GameStop, GM & Ford spiked last week, let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of Friday as we saw most of the stock market giving up some of the big gains of the week, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/ZxdGSkm) losing .30% & the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/MRn5Q40) Industrial dropping 179 points while the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/F3wm2d8) barely managed to post a small gain for the day as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/JRkwsZn) ticking up a little but finishing under 22 for the week, with the Nasdaq gaining 4.2% in the short week the SP500 rising 1.9% and the Dow Jones posting a .6% gain.

About 55% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/hFF1hSm) were advancing on below average volume as the number of companies moving above the moving averages still remains very high. We only saw 3 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/pPJpQCk) posting small gains for the day while the biggest losers were the value play in Financials, Energy and Industrials, all losing more than .50%

For the week we saw communications outperform with a big spike after Netflix reported earnings, while Energy had more than one ugly day dropping big on Monday, Thursday and Friday.

Small-caps faired better to close out the [week](https://ibb.co/y0C39gJ), with all 3 groups posting gains of more than 1.5% while Large-Cap Value companies underperformed losing more than 2.5% for the week, as Growth Companies & Especially the big-caps finally outperformed this week, gaining 2.3%.

Here is the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/MnWSRV4), which was a pretty mixed bag, with Apple posting a big gain ahead of the earnings report while the other big tech companies also posted small-gains. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/BfYRHWS) though, we saw huge gains in most of the big tech names with all the FAANG names and Microsoft gaining more than 5% for the week, while Banks alongside Oil & Gas companies were the biggest losers

We also got some economic data on Friday as existing home [sales](https://ibb.co/KWxRW9m) rose again while the inventory is still at all time-lows of under 2 months of supply while the January [PMI](https://ibb.co/x54dqCy) current read came in at 58, way above the 55.5 expected and 55.3 in the previous read as both the Services and Manufacturing PMI saw a spike of more than 2 points

This week we also start the [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/2nsRvBx) frenzy, with AMD which might benefit from Intel’s drop last week, Microsoft & Starbucks reporting after Tuesday’s close as JNJ might also give some updates regarding their vaccine, while big value companies like Boeing, AT&T & Caterpillar report before the open on Wednesday & Friday. We also have some of the big tech names reporting on the same day, with Apple which is expected to have their first $100B quarter, Tesla & Facebook reporting after Wednesday’s close which might be a bigger volatility moment for the market depending on how the results come in.

In terms of economic [data](https://ibb.co/Fx6TWyw), we start off [today](https://ibb.co/4K4DDvp) with the Dallas FED Manufacturing survey but the most interesting ones are on Thursday & Friday, while we also wait to see what the FED announces in terms keeping the rates low & the money printer going with asset buying on Wednesday.

In some other stock market, we saw [Palantir](https://ibb.co/zV2vxft) soar on Friday, rising more than 25% to break the $30 levels after they updated their Demo Day scheduled for tomorrow. It’s expected that they will reveal the latest developments in their big software platforms and also reveal [new](https://ibb.co/swYH61R) software platforms that will continue to help the company grow such as SDDI, Low-Code/No-Code and other modular strategy software.

We also saw [Ford](https://ibb.co/D8cmmZn) soaring again, as the company is having the best monthly performance in more than 10 years and spiked more than 6% after JP Morgan upgraded the company based on their new product line which is what I’ve been saying about the company in some months now. Tesla is going to face serious competition in the next decade with all the other car manufactures pushing harder and harder into the EV world, with some of the most popular cars out there like the F150, the Bronco and other models joining the sector that will continue to improve and might actually become a good alternative to Tesla’s models. It’s the same with others like [GM](https://ibb.co/42G3ttK) which might be a good catch-up play compared to Tesla. By the way… [GM](https://ibb.co/vPwbPCs) is outperforming Tesla recently based on their developments in the EV & self-driving sector.

Meanwhile, [GME](https://ibb.co/bXYsj4k) had a wild day on Friday, gaining more than 50% despite being even higher as the battle between WSB & the shorts continues, with this move making Citron’s Left deciding to avoid further talks about the company probably in an attempt to avoid future attention at the GameStop short squeeze. Short Squeeze has seen a big rise in terms of [search](https://ibb.co/qn51BPH) interest after these latest moves in the GameStop stock and might even put more pressure on the bears, as retail investors might pump up this stock even more.

So, guys, this week might bring a lot of volatility depending on many of the important events we have. Earnings seasons & especially big tech results will be important to justify these high multiples most of the tech names have received, while we also have to see how the GDP comes in, as it is expected to have seen a 4% growth for the 4th quarter while the FED is under pressure to keep the money printer on and the rates low, if not, or if there is any doubt in their commitments and also some numbers come in worse than expected we might see the long-awaited correction/pullback. But I don’t think numbers or the FED are going to disappoint really, but that doesn’t exclude the possibility of the pullback… keep investing safely & have some money available to buy the dips if they appear, use them as a buying opportunity, not a panic sell.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/929L2rz) are pointing to a very good open, with the Nasdaq leading the way up almost 1%

AMD and NET are up a whopping $40 and $50 respectively since June and these are all after the hills and valleys of crazy news days.

2020-12-27 16:17:30,"Good idea to keep DRIPing: ABBV, APPL, MSFT, T, STOR, O, MAIN, STAG, VNQ, MO or keep dividends and purchase myself?","I’ve been in the market since early 2014.  I started with a few stocks, with 10 shares of APPL being my first purchase.  I didn’t know much about investing at the time, but learned to DRIP my dividends thru TDAmeritrade.  This made sense to at the time, especially because it was the only way to buy fractional shares and commissions were still $6.95. 

Given you can buy purchase shares without a commission now, I’m wondering if i should stop dripping and handle purchases myself.  I have about 10-12 dividend paying stocks, such as those listed in the title.  Several are monthly paying as well, including STAG, O, MAIN, and PREF.

To put it in perspective, i earned about $325 in dividends since 10/1/20 to present.  I don’t need the money at the moment.  I like most of my dividend stocks.  So keep DRIPing or allow the dividends to post to my account and other good buys at the time?

2020-12-10 22:29:52,MSFT or SNE (5 year Time Horizon),"Currently hold each around 10%, but would like to consider dropping one in order to have more cash to invest in higher growth stocks. 

With roughly 10x the market cap, I’m not sure how much more Microsoft will grow in the next 5 years compared to Sony. However in the last 5 years (ending Jan 2020) MSFT beat SNE growth by approximately 40% (relatively, of course). The last few months SNE is up about 15%, while MSFT is running sideways.  

Which company do you think has more growth potential for the next 5-10 years? 

MSFT has cloud computing analytics (or will soon), SaaS, retail and commercial hardware/software, and many, many other strong branches of their company tethered to their fundamentals. They are so strong. 

SNE has (imo) a slight edge in their console technology (although not gaming ecosystem overall). They are deep in commercial electronics production. They are developing their streaming service. What else?

2020-10-19 14:24:15,MSFT severely underpriced?,"I am trying to practice better fundamental analysis habits, and have started by estimating intrinsic values of stocks based off of the DCF model, basically following the exact guidelines TDAmeritrades education course suggests. 

After plugging in the right fundamental values, the model is suggesting that with 5 years of projected growth being considered, which I think is reasonable for a company like Microsoft, that the intrinsic value of the company is $500 a share, meaning its being undervalued by nearly 57%. 

I am wondering how accurate others think this might be. If it’s an accurate assessment, then it seems like an absolutely amazing value investment into what’s already one of the historically strongest stocks ever. Even looking at this estimate more conservatively, we’re still talking about a 57% margin of safety which is a lot of wiggle room to work with. 

I used the same approach with AAPL and it suggests AAPL is a bit over priced, putting its intrinsic value at roughly $96. Not as extreme but still interesting to see such big differences in estimated value between two of the biggest blue chip stocks out there. 

Do fundamentals like this mean anything to these highly rated stocks? Should I focus more on company news and/or technicals? Should I take intrinsic value estimations with a handful of salt? Going all in on Microsoft has always been tempting for me, but now that I am actually attempting a formal ‘analysis’, I feel a new confidence in it. Just not sure how seriously I should take these estimations.",41,0.77

I'll ignore my poor choice to buy a cannabis stock, that one is down big, but I'm really perplexed as to why MSFT seems to be doing nothing for the last few months despite consistently putting up great numbers. I don't have a huge portfolio yet, but MSFT is the largest single stock I own. Over the past 3 months, my MSFT is up only 2.57% which for my currently $5,276 stake, means it's only up $134.

2020-10-21 14:53:02,MSFT as the biggest part of your portfolio,"MSFT is big part of the Technology industry. Microsoft's market cap is $1,686.5 billion. It makes up 5.95% of VOO the vanguard SandP 500 ETf and 10.78% of QQQ the Nasdaq 100 ETF. It has many products that make up a big part of the world such as Github, Azure,Dynamics 365,LinkedIn ,Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Xbox and all of their stores that sell computers and laptops. Their Moat is being heavily diversified among many industries that will continue to grow and succeed in the future. Revenue in Q4 2020 was $38.0 billion and increased 13% from Q3 2020. Of that Revenue in Productivity and Business Processes was $11.8 billion and increased 6%. Some highlights in this industry was Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 5% driven by Office 365 Commercial revenue growth of 19%,   Office Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 6% and Office 365 Consumer subscribers increased to 42.7 million,  LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and  Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 13% driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 38% .   Revenue in Intelligent Cloud was $13.4 billion and increased 17%, with the really cool part of Azure revenue growth of 47%. This shows that the cloud or Azure is growing massively as the Industry is still very new and growing rapidly very year. Revenue in More Personal Computing was $12.9 billion and increased 14% with an interesting point of  Xbox content and services revenue increased 65% . The 4th gen Xbox will be released in the later half of 2020 which should include many amounts of Revenue for Microsoft. Microsoft had a total revenue of  $143.0 billion and increased 14% YOY.

Now we shall look at some of the Financials of MSFT. MSFT has $136.527B cash on hand as of Q4 2020. That could buy Starbucks and still have 40 billion USD left over. They have a P/E ratio of 38.76 which can be considered rich but compared with other Tech companies such as AMZN with a P/E ratio of 128.17 and APPl with a P/E ratio of 36.83. This is in line with the coamnpies with a similar market cap.  The Debt to Equity is  0.50. which is very good for a company with MSFT stature. MSFT dividend is $2.04 with a dividend with a yield of 0.92% which is alright for a growth company. The Profit margin is 30.96% which is ridiculous for such a highly valued company. MSFT P/S ratio is 11.55 which alright considering their market cap. The P/B ratio is 13.70 which is high but considering other tech companies such as AAPL with a P/B of 27.5 and AMZN with P/B ratio of 21.86. They have debt but their total assets outweigh their liabilities. MSFT share holder  equity is $118.304B which is very good for them. 

Future Growth and my price target for Microsoft 

 Cloud computing service is a market which is somewhat new but is rapidly expanding. Microsoft Azure is about a third of MSFT revenue but it will grow faster and faster as the  cloud computing service market grows. It is currently worth about $371.4 Billion in 2020 and it is projected in 2025 to be  $832.1 Billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 17.5%.  Also MSFT will continue to supe up the next generation Xbox with new gaming studios and Xbox exclusives. MSFt is also trying to get into the 5G business and it has also created a strategic partnership with Starlink which will give many people faster internet which will MSFT in the long term. MSFT is very stable and increasing on markets that grow very quickly and that will add to its MOAT and it will continue to grow.

2021-02-19 07:42:45,"To everyone new, worried about dips and market corrections - I am tired of you","People bought a lot of risky stuff. ICLNs, ARKKs etc.

These  people never held anything longer than 2-3 months, never went through a  market correction, never witnessed a scandal that wipes out 15% of  their position in a day.

I am not  saying that asking about market condition is wrong but there are stocks  that don't and won't dip on days like these, less risky, more stable but  less sexy also. It's your choice to buy a risky investment and please  be prepared to see some losses along the way.

GME  created a huge inflow of people to stock market subreddits and I am  tired of scrolling through thousands of posts asking about market  bubble, market correction. Yes some stocks are overvalued but we are in  totally uncharted waters given so much money printing, covid but also  investor beliefs in certain markets.

You  are buying stocks like AAPL and MSFT at high valuations, you are not  that person that bought apple in 2003 and has 120000% gains. Please be  weary about the other side of your trades - there are people taking huge  profits - if we will have a lot of them in a span of 10-15-30-120 days  we might see a market correction.

If  you are new to investing buying a stock feels like a very intimate  moment, sadly, a lot of people already own/owned that stock.

If  you want safety sell your positions and buy ETFs (stable all world,  maybe S&P), maybe go for a dividend stock like T. If you can't  handle your emotions make your portfolio all cash and trade on a paper  account.

And for the love of god  don't call yourself a ""long term investor"" because you are bag holding a  20% loss. It might never come back, may come back tommorow, maybe in 7  years? You never know. We might see a bunch of people soon using that  term more often to offset that psychological game of chess with the  market but in reality you are simply not realizing that losses. I am  100% sure these LTIs are going to sell their position once breaking  even.

Stock market is a game of  psychological chess and if you are weak - you will be wiped out by  people with time, money and huge balls.

Please create daily/monthly/yearly threads designed for a discussion about bubble/correction or market conditions. There is so much noise it's crazy.

2020-11-10 16:04:43,XBOX RELEASE . Gaming is a huge business + new income stream for MSFT,"From Seeking Alpha 


Xbox Series X and S release

On the 10th of November, Microsoft will release its new gaming console across the globe, the Xbox Series X and S. With Sony (SNE) releasing the new Playstation 5 two days later in some parts of the world, they are both right in time for the holiday season. Both consoles come seven years after their predecessors and mark the next-generation in console gaming. With $1.3 billion in revenue from gaming in the last quarter, Microsoft is looking for more. They already made a big move to bring some recognizable franchises such as Fallout and The Elders Scrolls to their platform with the acquisition of Bethesda. I think this is a great play. While Microsoft has some great titles to bring to the new Xbox, the quality and quantity of the exclusives isn't as good as for the Playstation. But also a gaming pureplay such as Nintendo (OTCPK:NTDOY) has better IP, which it can monetize. This is a prime reason why it's projected that the new Playstation will outsell the new Xbox:

That being said, the game industry is projected to grow significantly and with more gamers opting for subscription models, it is a great revenue source for Microsoft. So expect the gaming revenue growth to continue with substantial percentages.",0,0.42
2020-04-24 12:12:10,How would an equal weighted GOOGL MSFT AAPL portfolio have performed vs. market?,"Let's say you started with $30,000 5 years ago to this date. No dividend reinvestment or additional shares bought.

&#x200B;

**Scenario A:** 100% in VTI (total market index fund)

Today's amount: $38,401 (+$8,401)

Total return: 28%

Annual return: 5.6%

&#x200B;

**Scenario B:** 100% in SPY (S&P 500 index fund)

Today's amount: $40,116 (+$10,116)

Total return: 33.7%

Annual return: 6.74%

&#x200B;

**Scenario C:** 1/3rd in each of GOOGL, MSFT, AAPL, [the three largest companies by market cap in 2015.](https://investorplace.com/2015/06/largest-companies-by-market-cap-facebook-walmart-fb-wmt/)

Today's amount: $81,270 (+$51,270)

Total return: 170.9%

Annual return: 34.18%

Breakdown:

* MSFT $10,000 -> $36,886 (268.9% up)
* AAPL $10,000 -> $21,374 (113.7% up)
* GOOGL $10,000 -> $23,009 (130% up)

A lot of people are looking for the hot, sexy young stock that will beat the market and double within 5 years, but sometimes the best plays are also the most obvious. It's easy to believe ""small company will grow faster than big company"" but the large cap growth companies have economies of scale and extremely high amounts of capital to invest in both their products and expanding their market share. They also have stability, great management and brand recognition, which breeds investor confidence and makes people feel safe entrusting their money to them.

This also suggests that index funds may be safe and diversified, but if a blue chip growth company is worthy of your confidence, you're potentially better off not over-diversifying away your returns. Note: if any one of these companies completely failed and fell off the map somehow, assuming no impact one way or another to the others, the total returns of the other two would still have beaten SPY WITH that company included by a significant amount - even if the vanished company was Microsoft, the biggest returner.

**EDIT:**

I will be posting a longer term analysis shortly following this methodology back historically using the top 3 US market cap companies based on the Q1 values of the [Financial Times Global 500 each year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization). I compare buying and holding $1000 worth of shares of each of the top 3 companies each year since 1996 (when the Global 500 started) on market open Jan 1st of that year vs. buying and holding $3000 worth of SPY on the same day, with no dividend reinvestments either way. Following this methodology:

Cash basis: $75,000 (25 years x $3000)

The ""Big 3"" portfolio: $199,445

SPY portfolio: $165,164

This is including buying and holding declining behemoths like GE, CSCO and XOM which are lower today than when they were at the top.

More details soon....

2021-02-11 11:08:19,Message to other young investors,"For background, I'm 20. The markets have been very exciting lately. Huge gains have been made....but also huge losses. I am in the latter group. I saved money for most of my life, and started investing during 2020 after the pandemic hit. I didn't want to trade, I wanted to just get long term investments and hold them. And that did work out pretty well. I was down red at certain points, but it was never SERIOUS drops, and I was confident that my picks were good in the long run. I wouldn't go into details about the weighting, but my portfolio essentially contained AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, SQ, NKE, ARKK, PLTR, NVDA, WMT, COST, DIS, JNJ, PG, V, and a couple other small picks that were my ""fun"" stocks - I actually had a few dozen APHA shares at $6. I had heavy tech weighting, but I was confident in the long term prospects. 

By this year, just about everything was in the green, and collectively up around 15%. Then came BB. BB looked appealing so I sold most of my stocks that had been moving sideways for a while (AMZN, MSFT, NVDA) and put the money into BB when it was low teens. Within a couple days, it hit the 20s and I sold for thousands in profit. The fact that I made thousands of dollars by doing nothing was crazy to me. The rest of my portfolio was also up several thousand dollars (overall, my profit was around $7000 at this point - a combination of the realized gains from BB and the unrealized gains from everything else). 

Then came GME. Several months ago, I neglected GME because I did not think they were a good long term investment, and so I did not buy them when they were less than $20/share. So when I saw the stock jump to 40, and 60 in the span of hours, I thought that was crazy. So what did I do? Naturally, I got FOMO when the stock was almost $400 and bought into the hype because I actually believed in what people over at another subreddit were saying. Within a week, my portfolio dropped around 80% (roughly $20,000). I thought that would be the best learning experience for me, but I bought into the weed hype this week, and have lost another few thousand dollars. **All in all, I've lost 90% of my money in the past month.** I'm young so I can recover, and this wasn't money I needed urgently. But my money I worked for and saved is completely gone because of my decisions. 

I'm writing this mostly for myself because I needed a reality check for myself and don't have anyone to talk to. I can't sleep at nights, and can't really focus on anything else. I've lost all interest in playing video games, and my grades are starting to take a hit. This is really embarrassing for me, and nobody knows I lost my money on stocks (nor do I want them to). I don't know if anyone needs to here this, but please be careful with your money, and don't invest more than you're willing to lose. Especially for young investors, we have such a long time horizon. There's no need to try and get rich quick. Conservative investing will compound over our lives.

2020-08-03 09:26:59,Would it be safe to assume that MSFT is most likely going to make the TikTok deal?,"Tiktok is one of the most trending sites worldwide. With issues of security, MSFT has consulted with Byte dance in order to reach an agreement for a sale.

Recently as a few days ago, MSFT is still very persistent in their goals to purchase tiktok. [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/business/dealbook/tiktok-microsoft-takeover.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/business/dealbook/tiktok-microsoft-takeover.html)

Other articles suggest that MSFT will try to seal a deal before September 15th (6weeks).  [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/03/microsoft-confirms-talks-to-buy-tiktok-in-us.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/03/microsoft-confirms-talks-to-buy-tiktok-in-us.html) 

(There's like 50 more articles on these topics I've been reading up on, but too lazy to go back and find them all.)

In my opinion, I think MSFT will purchase Tiktok on the fact that the USA plans to ban it, the USA is a huge consumer for the app, losing USA users would drastically drop profits, so it makes sense that Tiktok will be pressured into selling their app.

So here are my other questions:


If Tiktok is aquired by MSFT would this be a great longhold to add to my portfolio?

2020-08-22 04:17:19,"My 2 cents on MSFT, AMZN, TSLA, AAPL","Disclaimer:  I own all four stocks and together they are > 50% of my portfolio (was 45% last week hahaha)

I am looking to rebalance/add more on MSFT & AMZN ... these two will not be left behind in the wake of AAPL MKT CAP.  TSLA is doing its own thing in my opinion

Few things come to mind:

1. Stock split will have to happen soon in AMZN, I actually feel their plans might have been derailed with AAPL and TSLA stock split plans
2. MSFT & AMZN have a very diverse business portfolio and are less dependent on singular product sales like AAPL & TSLA longer term however with the ways things are in the world MSFT, AMZN and AAPL are very much positioned to capitalize.  The jury is still out on TSLA for me.
3. I think after stock splits of TSLA, AAPL the smart money moves to MSFT and AMZN, and their price movement in the last couple of weeks is impacted by the capital needed for investors to build their positions in AAPL and TSLA.  This is clearly indicated by the volume development in the last month AAPL and TSLA(\~+27% for both in the last month) v MSFT (\~+0.6%) and AMZN (\~+5%) in the last month.

The magic numbers: if AMZN or MSFT were to hit $2trn MKT Cap (not unrealistic), then their share price would need to be: :

\- $4K (AMZN) - increase of 18% from today.

To be more competitive in pricing AMZN will need to look at a possible 1:20 stock split

\- $265 (MSFT) - Increase of 20% from today.

To be competitive in pricing MSFT will possible be looking at 1:3 stock split if they were to proceed, but this might be a year or so out.

Looking at the speed and monumental increase post split announcement of AAPL and TSLA ... imagine what will happen if AMZN did a split... Lock, Load and be ready....

They use historical prices to back it up, and they inform anyone who’ll listen to sit on large quantities of cash, because everything will come crashing down soon

Is there anyone out there that thinks that won’t happen?

I can see a -20% decline over the course of a couple months happening in the next couple years. I can also see certain industries that are inflated to come crashing down. If you see what happened to [ZM](https://i.imgur.com/IumMxau.jpg) from October to December, I can easily see something like that happening to a variety of different growth stocks that are completely mispriced. 

But we also have companies making a LOT of money that can justify a lot of the prices. AAPL made over $100 billion **in a single quarter**, and they’re growing 20% YoY. They have almost $200 billion in cash alone, and they’re innovating and finding new ways to make money. Why is a $2 trillion market cap unreasonable?

Same with AMZN, MSFT, and other big tech companies. Unlike the dot com levels, tech companies are actually making a lot of money. I personally can’t imagine a -40% market drop that later stagnates for years on end when companies like AAPL have most cash in hand than their entire 2010 [market capitalization ](https://money.cnn.com/2010/03/29/technology/apple_valuable_companies.fortune/index.htm).

MSFT and WMT, as we all already know, are near closing a deal with ByteDance to acquire TikTok, and assuming they are successful in doing so, MSFT's stock price will shoot up from an already ATH, so I'd argue a stock split makes a lot of sense.

Any thoughts?",0,0.5

2020-07-20 00:58:06,Comparing AMZN to WMT + MSFT's Cloud.,"In this post I want to compare AMZN's two segments, it's retail segment and it's AWS segment, to its two biggest competitors Walmart retail and Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud services to see how AMZN is being valued compared to them. 

First looking at Amazon’s retail segment, its revenue is less than half of Walmart’s ($524B to $245.5B) and its operating income is about 1/4 of Walmart’s ($20.6B to $5.3B). However, If Amazon continues its last year’s growth rate of 19% then it will pass Walmart’s revenue (at 2% growth) in just 5 years. Its operating income is harder to calculate because Amazon prefers future market share to current profits, so Amazon retail operating income will probably still lag Walmart’s for some time longer. Walmart’s current Market cap is $373B. Amazon’s retail segment I’d value at anywhere from $350B to $500B, depending on how Walmart+ is able to compete with Prime and slow down Amazon’s growth. 

Now looking at Amazon’s AWS compared to Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment. Both segments are pretty comparable. MSFT has the revenue edge by 11% and the Operating Income edge by 51%. Again, showing Amazon’s strategy of sacrificing current profits for future growth. Though Intelligent Cloud has a higher income growth rate(32% to 26%) Amazon has a higher revenue growth rate (37% to 31%). I’d give more value to MSFT’s Intelligent Cloud segment than AWS but at this point they both have very similar long term potential. Seeing as IC is about 1/3 of both Microsoft’s revenue and profits but has a high steady growth rate, I’d give it a value of about 40-45% of MSFT’s market cap. That gives MSFT’s IC and AMZN’s AWS a value between $616B to $693B.  

If you take the high end valuation of both Amazon’s retail and AWS segment then that gives a market cap of almost $1.2T. That means AMZN is about 25% over valued at its current cap of $1.5T. Or it means MSFT and/or WMT are very undervalued at current valuations. Or a combination of the two. Or you think AMZN will do something that doesn’t exist yet that warrants a 25% premium. What do you guys think on the value of AMZN relative to WMT and MSFT's Intelligent Cloud? 

Full disclosure about 5% of my portfolio is MSFT. I do not own WMT or AMZN shares.",12,0.84

2020-07-03 23:46:14,What are the MSFT's and AAPL's of the Health Care sector? (2-3 year outlook investing advice please!),"I'm looking for a health care company or two to invest in for the next 2-3 years. I'd like to avoid ETF's though.

The problem is that it seems like a lot of companies are way overvalued due to the coronavirus pandemic (i.e. MRNA, NVAX, INO, BIIB to name a few). Not to mention, I don't see their prices being stable at all. One negative report on their covid vaccine progress and their price plummets. I need something more stable with 100% promising outlook for the next 2 years at least. I originally thought JNJ but apparently they haven't been doing so well in the past month or two.

Things I've thought of...

* Mental health care continues to be a growing problem
* Obesity and health problems related to that (diabetes, high blood pressure, etc) also continue to be a growing problem
* Virtual health care, but so far the only company that seems to be publicly traded is TDOC. It seems overvalued though- I haven't done much DD on this
* Ventilator stock? Similar to covid stocks, I'm inclined to assume I ""missed the boat"" but with surges in cases I personally think things are only going to get way worse, I like to think ventilator stocks like RMD could be an incredible pick. However that'd be a short term investment not 2-3yr investment
* General consensus seems to be that Biden is likely to win election. Not sure what this means for health care though. Would this be positive or negative news for health insurance stock UNH?",3,0.61

2021-01-17 05:13:12,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How is ""Hype"" calculated?**

Well, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

Buffett's company earned $255 billion in revenue and booked $73 billion in investment gains last year, fueling $81 billion in net income. Moreover, it held $137 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of March — enough to buy Tesla in its entirety at the time, as its market value had tumbled below $100 billion during the coronavirus crash.

Meanwhile, Tesla had about 48,000 full-time workers last year, less than an eighth of Berkshire's workforce. It also generated about $25 billion in sales — a tenth of Berkshire's revenue — and posted a $900 million net loss. Musk's company also had only $6.6 billion in net assets last year, less than 1/60th of Berkshire's $425 billion.

I don't care about how much it is currently valued and whether there will be another dip or not, but rather the long term growth of the company.

AAPL, MSFT, FB are the biggest tech companies that I believe have huge potential, however I don't know whether they can out perform the other stock.

NFLX pretty much owns the streaming industry aside from what I believe are petty competition from Disney+ and Prime video.

TSLA already OWNS the entire EV industry and I see a very, very bright future.

As for V, I don't see credit cards going anywhere anytime soon.

NVDA is a big one as the gaming industry is continuously growing year by year without signs of stopping.

BABA is basically China's version of AMZN and has revenues of over $50B USD.

2021-03-08 20:57:34,Buy the dip growth candidates,"Hey y'all,

As the market transitions out of growth and tech stocks and into value, I want to position myself appropriately. these same stocks that have gone done 20-30% in the past two weeks are the same stocks that every wanted to buy a month ago, touted by Wall Street analysts but didn't due to valuation and recent growth fallacy. If you could pick a handful of high growth companies to buy and hold for the next few years, which would they be? Looking back on the March dip, it is crazy to see how cheap some of these stocks got.

I'm aiming for 10x on each pick, obviously there is a high likelihood none of these 10x but, to justify investment with a high risk tolerance and long time horizon it makes little sense for me to buy an AAPL or MSFT-mature growth

Looking back on it, I wish I had bought SQ, ROKU, TSLA, SHOP before they blew up these past couple of years into what they are today,. What, in your eyes are those stocks and why? Sure they could still be SQ ROKU and SHOP and I will continue to add these on red days.

My research has led me to consider the following:

**IPOE** (Sofi), I really like Square and may add it but its market cap is already 100 billion. I haven't done nearly enough DD and would love to hear other's take on it. Little scared the lending side of the company comprises too much of the business but it could give the co a nice backbone to pair with their brand's higher growth components: Galileo acquisition and trading platform

**ROKU:** Love the company, obviously tough competition but seems they are outpacing amazon and changing the way our streaming services are monetized- not sure if we'll ever see 400 billion here but I also really like **MGNI** and the pullback its given us.

**SPTK**: to me, this gives off plug energy vibes. It has a relatively small market cap, approx. 5 billion depending on the day and is a market leader in AI, clean energy. Massive TAM. I could go more in depth but I think its well positioned to grow in coming years.

Next up is **Unity(U) and C3 AI(AI)**: I am grouping these together because both are still extremely expensive based on valuation and are recent IPOs but have lots of long term growth ahead in both their respectable spaces, AR/VR and AI

**TDOC:** Huge fan of Cathie Woods but I struggle to develop conviction in this oen and would love to hear what you guys think of it- was a fan of livongo but it seems like that area of the high flying business has been

**PINS:** lotta potential here, theres a reason MSFT has tried to acquire these guys

**UPWK/FVRR**: As society becomes increasingly postmodern, the gig economy will only continue to expand, pricy now and set for correction as we transition out of covid but am long.

**ARKK, ARKF (any one of the ARK funds really)**: set and forget. Harder to get the exponential gains when portfolio allocation is capped at 10% maximum but still offer great exposure to tech with little worry knowing Cathie is running the show

**ETSY:** niche that not even Amazon can compete w, like the company alot esp after how they crushed earnings. Undeniably a benefactor of covid and could see more pull back

In terms of value, I'd consider **BA, BRK-B**",24,0.81

2021-02-26 21:57:23,Why equities are just in the beginning of the bull run [Long post],"Wrote this for wsb, but it also goes here, I guess.

TL;DR: This post will try to present the thesis that equities are just in the beginning of the bull run and argues that you should be investing in the stock market right now.

# Premise:

Equities are selling off due to rising [treasury yield.](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/textview.aspx?data=yield) The reason behind the rise of treasury yields are complex.

But let me try to explain nonetheless.

1. People are expecting that the economy will reopen successfully and will have a higher inflation and all that stuff. Now yields being that low, it was slowly getting unattractive as bonds are not necessarily the best investment if the economy goes into full gear as there is less need for safety and [more appetite  for risk assets](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bonds-markets-idUSKBN29Q2NR). Plus, bonds were already at a price where yields  couldn’t have gone any lower(meaning existing bond prices couldn’t have gone any higher). Thus, this lower demand  lead to a rise in yields.
2. This created a feedback loop due to mortgage-backed bond investors selling off their treasury bonds which helped the treasury yield to go even higher. They do it due to convexity hedging. If you have no idea about what I said, [read this one up.](https://www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/convexity-hedging-haunts-markets-already-reeling-from-bond-rout) This has been one of the primary driver behind the recent movement of treasury yield. Overall, this elevated level in treasury yield is unlikely to sustain because the FED continues to abolish the free market and will continue to buy. Thus, the yield is unlikely to rise too much higher.
3. JPow and Yellen has already given us enough indications that they will accept lower rates for a longer period of time. Specifically, until we reach full employment. Thus, they will allow the economy to get hot and also allow inflation to rise if the mean inflation is 2%. These are based on their publicly stated statements, which means it may mean something.
4. Now, consider the scenario, real interest rate will remain negative, the yield in treasury is unlikely to reach too high because of the artificial market scenario. While, we know that ***long term bonds outperformed stocks tremendously*** over the [last 20 years(article data till April 29)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/business/bonds-beat-stocks-over-20-years.html) With long treasury bonds having an annualised return of 8%+, while S&amp;amp;P 500 having only 5.5%+; that was a terrible risk adjusted return for stocks. The same picture emerges for the last 5 years [since 2015(dataset ourdated).](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-17/long-dated-treasuries-crush-s-p-500-performance-over-five-years)
   1. This whole ordeal is because yield was very high at the beginning of the century. And as yield continued to fall, the bonds rose in price, as is customary. Now, as the yield slightly rises, it quickly becomes more attractive as the yields could fall pretty quickly and increase the bond price. This also attracts more bond investors; as a result, I suspect that yields will not rise too much. Plus, it is a very crowded trade.
   2. As a result of bond having this superb risk-adjusted return, stocks saw huge outflows. According to Cathie Wood, [stocks saw $300B in outflows(excluding repurchases)  since 2018 and bonds saw $1T in inflows.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stocks-arent-in-a-bubble-but-heres-what-is-according-to-fund-manager-ark-invests-cathie-wood-11612958113) So, if there is actually any bubble, it is in the bond market. Think about it for a second. Sure, bonds provided absolutely superior risk-adjusted return compared to stocks, but because of this, everyone and their mother are in bonds. Stocks were like the orphan child in the bigger scheme of various financial markets.
      1. Now, bond yields are rising slightly and the yield curve is normalising, but going any higher is unlikely due to the slow abolishment of free market. In this scenario, we won't be seeing any negative rates, while continuing to experience negative real interest rate; being a bond investor would be painful. If you are a bond investor already, you want the yield to go lower, potentially negative, but that is not happening either. If yields rise, you are losing money. If you are a prospective bond investor, you have to worry if yields will go higher just after you invest with all the inflation shenanigans going on.
5. Liquidity is present in the market. Bonds aren't that attractive, stocks are a good bet in this scenario. Especially with all those stimulus talks and stuff. Inflation is also good for the stock market overall as long as we don't go Weimar republic style. After all, you are duddenly not going to stop buying from AMZN, stop using MSFT products or PLTR products just because inflation is here. Question is, which stocks? I think boomer stocks are your best friend(look for the things BRK buys). And after the whole convexity hedging and yield rising stabilises, buying the dip in the tech stocks wouldn't be a bad idea either(I think).
6. US Dollar has been declining after March. It is, overall, good for the stock market and the global economy in general. For one, it makes it easier for foreigners to buy US stocks and two, it boosts the earnings of our corporations in foreign markets. One could say, EM stocks are a potential good source for risk-adjusted return and I also think the same. Although, short USD have had been a popular, crowded and winning strategy for the last year, one should be careful in doing so as any black swan event could catapult the USD higher. However, in the long run, I suppose EM stocks would also be a good area to look out for. Especially, India seems to be the choice for our lawmakers currently.
7. Rising commodity prices and stuff are mostly due to speculation, and not specifically supply crunch. Some are saying that we will see very high inflation due to supply shortage, which would be bad for the market. But I disagree. We have so many structural deflationary forces within our economy. Stagnating wages, high unemployment, technological innovations, cheap labour based production in foreign countries, demographic challenges etc. Some supply crunch is definitely there, but to say that production won't normalise after demand rises due to reopening and stuff is being wilfully blind.
   1. Some of you may not know that CPI does include rents, healthcare expenditures and stuff based on how much they actually cost us, so, before you comment that the government is manipulating CPI to make inflation numbers low, I would suggest you to read how [and what are the weights of each consumption factors.](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/home.htm) Also, stimulus money hardly increases velocity of money because it doesn't really counter the loss of employment income. Just for clarification, there is lots of asset inflation, for example, bonds are very inflated.
8. Our government is doing a shit ton of deficit financing, from that we can expect they will do everything to stop deflation and inflate away the debts. It is in the best interest of our government to keep borrowing money at low cost and to inflate away the debt. Thus, our government has a huge incentive to keep the yield low, while also allowing inflation to rise. You may think, how can this be a free market if... basically, this is capitalism with USA characteristics. Add to that, direct or indirect beneficiaries of these shit ton of deficit financing is, well, the various companies.

# Conclusion

Using my crystal ball, which cost me $0 to buy, I can say this:

This is what I can say from all the points that I have mentioned. Risk assets like stocks are now more attractive than bonds. USD is accommodative for the stock market. Global economic recovery, especially in EM economies will be good, thus helping our companies. Deficit financing. Inflation will be good for ***most*** stocks. Liquidity is present. Bond yields will also stabilise soon as the feedback loop ultimately stops. No deflation. There is likely going to be real inflow into stocks. Stocks will probably finally outperform long term bonds.

Thus, I think, while we will have lower overall rate of return(just like Munger said) in this decade, yet I think we will continue to have a good bull market for a while. Current panic in the market is nonsensical to me.

^(Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I eat crayons and stuff. This is a casino. Don't listen to a stranger on the internet, please don't. I also have used my crystal ball to predict all those future outcomes.)

Risk of my predictions being completely off the mark.

* Fed decides to increase fed funds rate suddenly for overheating/other events and starts quantitative tightening.
* We do have a huge supply crunch in every sector after reopening and inflation goes to the moon. Yields also goes to the moon.
* Black swan events.
* Think of something yourself man!

Edit: My post couldn’t have been more timely! Warren Buffett has warned quite clearly in his annual letter about the ""bleak future"" for debt investors.

“Fixed-income investors worldwide — whether pension funds, insurance companies or retirees — face a bleak future,” he wrote. “Competitors, for both regulatory and credit-rating reasons, must focus on bonds. And bonds are not the place to be these days.”

2021-03-11 13:41:51,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, March 11, 2021. Please enjoy!","Stocks continued advancing on Thursday, with the Dow Jones (DIA) and the S&P 500 (SPY) setting fresh intraday records. Market participants are encouraged after President Biden signed into law a new coronavirus relief package. Treasury yields also steadied at 1.525% at the time of writing. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 2.3% up, the SPY closed 1% up, and the Dow closed 0.62% up.

After months of negotiation, President Biden signed into law a new $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package after the bill passed in both houses of Congress by party-line votes. The bill includes provisions like $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits through early September, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government aid. The bill comes exactly one year following the World Health Organization's formal designation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. 

Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote of the bill “The most immediate impact in the macroeconomic data will be in retail sales numbers, where some of the $410 billion in direct payments will appear in both the March and — especially — April reports.”

The sharp contrast between the performance of the Dow and the Nasdaq in recent weeks underscores market participant’s increasing rotation out of high-flying tech stocks that led the markets higher in 2020 into stocks that are poised to directly benefit from the impending economic reopening. The cyclical energy and financials sectors have also been leading gains in the S&P 500, extending a run of outperformance against tech and growth shares.

The [Labor Department's Consumer Price Index (CPI)](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm) on Tuesday showed core consumer prices increased less than expected in February.{prices paid by consumers rose only 1.3% in February over last year, coming in below the 1.4% increase expected and slowing from the prior month. While it may not seem like a lot, the report helps quell fears that as economic activity increased and more stimulus was unleashed into the economy, inflationary pressures would begin to materialize. This also suggests the Federal Reserve can maintain its accommodative monetary policy and avoid rising interest rates for the foreseeable future.

2021-02-20 21:31:38,What are your long term plays for the rise of AI,"AI is poised to keep growing, with GPUs and other hardware used in AI becoming stronger, and with the eventual arrival of Quantum computers, we should see a great boom in AI in the next decade. What are your investment plans to profit out of this industry?

I see a few different ways to capitalize on this:

Investing in companies that provide hardware for AI: Here I'm most referring to AMD and NVIDIA, their GPUs have become very useful for training AI models and are heavily used all across the industry. They are also not just dependent on AI but gaming as well since their GPUs are used for that as well. [This](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/White_Papers/ARK%E2%80%93Invest_BigIdeas_2021.pdf?hsCtaTracking=4e1a031b-7ed7-4fb2-929c-072267eda5fc%7Cee55057a-bc7b-441e-8b96-452ec1efe34c) should be a good read. Cathie woods is expecting a huge rise in the deep learning / AI Chips market which should definitely benefit these industries. Even at AMD/Nvidia's current levels I think they have room to grow.

Investing in core AI applications company: I'm taking about companies like [C3.AI](https://C3.AI), PLTR (I am very bulling on PLTR) and other companies that provide AI/data analysis based solutions. These have heavy exposure to just AI and are sort of high risk high reward plays, even in the long term.

Investing in big corps that have exposure to AI: Good old MSFT, GOOG and other similar companies. This should keep your money comparatively safer while also giving you think opportunity to capitalize on AI boom.

What are your plays? Your plans, specific companies you are interested in?

Second time posting DD ($ON was my first [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lh6ppx/on_on_semiconductor_analysis/))- please do provide constructive feedback on what other areas you would have looked into / found useful and overall formatting. Additionally, if you have arrived at different conclusions / can poke holes in the theory I look forward to reading rebuttals in the comments. There was a lot more research that went into this one as some of the kind commenters identified gaps in my research methodology last time so I have tried to make up for it here.

All currency in USD and Millions unless otherwise specified.

### TL; DR

Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink) is a telecommunications company which provides products and services related Network, Cloud, Security, Voice, and Managed Services to enterprise, SME, and retail customers.
Lumen is aiming to position itself as a key infrastructure partner underpinning public and private cloud, edge computing and fiber connectivity. LUMN is building its services with 4 key areas in mind:

1. Physical assets and infrastructure – These include fiber, hardware and facilities.

2. Software managed networking – This is a network-as-a-service (NaaS) offering that can be leveraged to connect organisations with

3. Hybrid Cloud – These include private cloud and datacentres, colocation services and connections with public cloud service provider partners.

4. Lumen Orchestrator – This is the orchestration solution that allows for the management and control of the various services that are offered.

I am currently bearish about LUMN with no immediate plans to invest (although in the event of the price dropping into the single digits, I would re-evaluate this position). There are a few key reasons for this, but I encourage you to read the full bullish, bearish, and neutral considerations in the rest of the post:

1. LUMN earns a significant portion of its revenues from legacy offerings e.g., traditional telephony. This revenue stream has been decreasing YoY for the last few years and this is likely to continue. 

2. Despite the above, there are significant areas of potential for LUMN – specifically in their Edge Computing and software defined networking offerings (see Organisational Summary below). Edge Computing is only a small % of current revenues and while it is likely to grow, it will take time to significantly grow these streams. I view the Edge Computing growth as a slow burner and small market, but this will grow at a rapid rate in the future.

3. LUMN has a high level of debt, and while they have managed to de-lever and reduce interest rates, the amount of debt is still significant. When accounting for intangibles and goodwill, the level of liabilities is roughly 1.6x the value of assets (although specifically looking at long term debt this is a healthier picture at 70% of non-current assets).

4. Revenues have been consecutively down for the last few years and are unlikely to show a significant turnaround next year. This is somewhat mitigated by improvements in margin which are expected to continue and a healthy level of free cash flow at $2,770 although this has been declining YoY. 


Please do have a read of the Bull, Bear and Neutral points in the detailed post below for a more balanced and in-depth view.

### Key Data

All data believed to be accurate as of 05/03/2021

- Price = $13.45
- P/E = -12x
- EPS = -2.12 (dil)
- Forward P/E = 8.5x


# Detailed Analysis

### Bull Considerations

- $LUMN are well positioned to become significant players in high potential markets – specifically fiber and underlying network infrastructure, NaaS and Edge computing.

- $LUMN has several verticals it can offer to customers including Hybrid Cloud, Connected Security and Collaboration. These can be leveraged to grow revenue streams in parallel (i.e., cross selling products and services to customers).

- Successfully managed to de-lever the company from previous debts. While this is a great deleveraging trend and a significant reduction in interest rates by redeeming outstanding 5.375% and 7.00% notes^(1) and replacing them with 4% bonds, the level of debt is still a concern (see bearish consideration item 1).

- The dividend from $LUMN has been consistent and relatively attractive (although on a yield basis this is less so if the price continues to rise). The board are committed to continuing the dividend payment and at the present time it can be safely assumed that $0.25 will be paid per share per quarter for the remainder of FY21. Dividend yield should not be the primary reason for going into $LUMN as yield is ~ 7% (at a stock price of $13.70). In the event of a dip to single digits, the dividend becomes extremely attractive and is worth considering (at a yield of > 9%).

- Despite the overall reduction in EBITDA (see bearish item 4), EBITDA margin has improved and is likely to continue improving into FY21 due to cost cutting measures being pushed by executive leadership.

- Significant number of insider purchases throughout 2020 with one sale.


### Bear Considerations

- Overall, there are likely to be better candidates for returns on investments than LUMN, while LUMN is in a number of attractive areas, it is still growing revenues and these are unlikely to materialise in any significant manner over the next year or two. See competitive advantage section for additional details.

- $LUMN holds significant long-term debt of $31,837 (down from $34,694 in 2019). This debt is primarily due to $LUMN’s all in play to fiber (at the expense of 5g) when they purchased Level 3 Communications for $34,000. It is worth noting that $LUMN has not had an issue with either paying down debt and paying dividends with its current cash flow.

- $LUMN earns a substantial portion of revenues from legacy services. These include voice ($391 in 4Q20) which approximates to 29% of overall revenue. As can probably be guessed, this has regularly declined over the course of FY20. While not all the voice revenue is likely to be a “legacy” product, I am considering it as such as there are likely to be other legacy revenue streams. (N.B. According to $LUMN legacy revenues primarily include voice, private line (including special access), switched access and other ancillary services.)

- $LUMN is facing lengthening sales cycles for its products and services as their customers (and more likely organisations in general) continue to evaluate new infrastructure needs and delay purchasing unless necessary. This is likely to continue until at least 2022 as cost pressure at organisations globally push down purchases.

- Revenues are down both QoQ and YoY with EBITDA down YoY and there is no expectation that they will increase next year with best estimates at stable revenue / EBITDA and worst-case a reduction. YoY revenues have decreased for both FY20, FY19 and FY18, although the rate of decrease has reduced over time.

- Free cash flow while still high is reducing over time and will continue to do so as LUMN are likely to continue to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and paying off its long-term debt.

- Executive compensation (specifically focussing on CEO compensation) is above average for the industry at $17M (compared to an average of $10M for similar sizes). It is worth noting that when comparing against larger companies or those listed as competitors, this level of compensation was not unusual. Compensation did stabilise as performance dropped, however, no decrease in compensation occurred despite the decrease in earnings. While not initially a problem, if the results do not turn around, and there is no decrease in compensation, there is a concern that executive pay is no longer in line with the company’s results.


### Neutral Considerations

- Long term credit rating (Moody’s) – Ba3: Speculative with substantial - high credit risk.

- Speculative Grade Liquidity Ratings – SGL-2: Good liquidity, will be able to meet their obligations over the next 12 months through mostly internal resources but may rely on external sources of committed financing.

- Southeastern Asset Management has increased its position in $LUMN as of Dec 2020. It is worth noting that they have lost (~25%) on the investment to date^(2). Despite this, they remain bullish on the overall prospects as the CEO has tightened controls on costs and margin improves. Additionally, they believe $LUMN can monetise several segments they are in (specifically fiber), and that as a multiple of free cash flow (< 5 at the time of investing) is an attractive valuation. As a final point, they have signed an NDA with $LUMN, and this indicates a higher and more “activist” level of engagement^(3). I have listed this as neutral despite the bullish sentiment of SAM, as their track record for the last year has not been great compared to the overall market.

- $LUMN will be seeing reduced subsidy revenue (from CAF II – A US initiative to improve connectivity) with subsidies declining to $20 by 2022. However, $LUMN believes their investment into providing this connectivity is likely to add to revenue that will make up for the loss in subsidy.


### Organisation Summary

Essentially Lumen Combine underlying infrastructure with platforms (i.e., cloud PaaS) and Applications (SaaS):

1. Adaptive Networking – High performance network connectivity i.e., on premise private lines, Content Delivery Network, fiber internet connectivity, direct cloud connections (where they provide corporate WAN infrastructure a direct link to Cloud) and managed networking services / consulting.
  - Content delivery network market growth is forecast to grow at 14% till 2025^(4).
  - Fiber Internet connectivity in the US grew at 12% from 2019-202022 and will likely continue to grow at a similar rate for the next few years. Across the EU growth rates are largely similar for both coverage growth and subscriber growth^(5).
  - Software defined networking offerings (Networking as a service) is an expanding industry and likely to see significant growth of 34% annually till 2026^(6).
  - Growth rates and industry sizes for private lines and direct cloud connections are not easily available. I believe direct cloud connections are a growth area and likely to grow at a reasonable 10-15% annually for the next few years (based on over all cloud growth, increase in colocation and deployment of data centres – see Hybrid Cloud below).

2. Collaboration - VOIP, teleconferencing, collaboration solutions (e.g., file sharing and virtual meeting rooms all hosted by Lumen, but the products can be from vendors like Zoom, Webex Skype etc.), contact centres and calling services (e.g., traditional phone style calling both locally and internationally as well as toll free / business numbers. Also advanced emergency services support).
  - VOIP is relatively mature industry with a CAGR of 12% (at best) till 2025^(7). Personally, I think we can discount any mobile VOIP growth as I do not believe LUMN has offerings in this space and in my view, this would lower the effective CAGR with 8-10% looking a more reasonable target.
  - Call centre growth is forecast to grow at 6% till 2027^(8). The US houses over 60% of call centres globally, and this number is only going to decrease as increased internet penetration and decreased telecom rates drive the outsourcing of call centres^(9).
  - Numbers and growth rates to traditional telephony are limited but I imagine that growth is probably negative. For toll free, business numbers and emergency services support, growth is likely positive but limited.
  - Collaboration solutions are growing at a reasonably high rate of 13% till 2027^(10). However, LUMN is limited to managing, implementing, running, and hosting products from other vendors as they do not sell their own.

3. Connected Security – Threat management (managed threat intelligence), managed SOC services, WAF and DDoS mitigation, managed firewalls, and professional services.
  - The WAF market is expected to grow at 18% annually till 2022^(11).
  - The DDoS mitigation market is set to grow at 15% annually till 2026^(12).
  - The managed security services are expected to grow at a CAGR of 8% till 2025^(13). While I think managed firewall growth is likely to be less than other managed security services (e.g., IAM, SOC etc), a growth rate of 4-6% is probable.

4. Edge Computing – Managed services, connections to both public cloud and private data centres, networking, colocation, cloud. Essentially connecting edge locations / end user servers to backbone infrastructure. 
  - Edge computing as an industry is forecast to grow at ~25% annually till 2025^(14). However, it is currently a small market valued at ~ $ 2,000 in 20201. Edge computing as a market can be further subdivided into hardware, platform, and services. Hardware is expected to grow at the fastest rate of the three potentially reaching 40%^(15).

5. Hybrid Cloud – Cloud storage, disaster recovery (data replication and business continuity), hosting services, data centres, private and public cloud alongside consulting for cloud.
  - The private cloud market is expected to grow at 29% annually till 2025. Private cloud growth will primarily be driven by businesses who wish to take advantage of public cloud capability with the addition of potentially more secure and customisable hosting resources. On-premises cloud growth will be significantly lower than provider hosted options (PaaS / IaaS) which are likely to hit 50%^(16).
  - Hosting services are likely to increase in market size by 15% annually^(17).
  - Deployment of data centres are likely to increase slowly over the next few years with a growth rate not likely to exceed 10% (estimated at 6% for 2021^(18)). Similarly, colocation services are likely to see a modest 14% CAGR^(19).
  - Global cloud storage is expected to increase at a rate of 20% till 2025^(20).

### Competitive Advantage

1. Adaptive Networking:
 - Summary: A large revenue earner with solid growth potential. $LUMN is a large player in the infrastructure space and should be able to leverage that to provide organisations with NaaS and global fiber connectivity.
 - From a coverage perspective (compared to Verizon and AT&T as of 2019), $LUMN serves 16% of the population, with Verizon and AT&T serving 17% and 41% respectively. It is worth noting that $LUMN covers more states than either^(21, 22). N.B. this view is for consumers but presumably also can also be applied to corporate coverage.
 - $LUMN is relatively well positioned from a fiber perspective as they have a lot of “unique coverage” (i.e., locations served without significant competition) in the US and have coverage in Europe and Asia. They carry a large portion of internet traffic on their network backbone and have 180,000 locations globally which provide their customers direct access to $LUMN infrastructure. Additionally, they have direct connectivity to several cloud service providers and data centres. Compared to competitors, they appear to have the largest total fiber route^(23).
 - The software defined networking offerings are an exciting growth opportunity and combined with the strong infrastructure position of $LUMN will mean that customers (particularly those that are multinationals and large enterprises) can utilise the network as a service offering to connect their enterprise infrastructure efficiently and effectively across the globe including connections from on-premises to cloud service providers.
 - While competitors do exist, from both a software defined networking perspective (e.g., Fortinet, Cato etc.) and an infrastructure perspective (e.g. Verizon, AT&T etc.) $LUMN has the advantage of being a strong player in both areas with good partnerships with Cisco and VMWare.

2. Collaboration:
 - Summary: Largely a legacy business and revenue generator for $LUMN. This will be a shrinking revenue area for $LUMN as the decline in traditional legacy telephony services is unlikely to be made up for by any growth in VoIP or collaboration solutions. Additionally, this area is a large revenue earner for $LUMN, and significant declines here would result in material impact to value.
 - While implementing and managing VoIP, teleconferencing and collaboration solutions with partnered vendors (e.g., Zoom) are likely to show some little to moderate growth over the coming years, they will likely provide consistent revenue due to the underlying network requirements needed to effectively utilise such solutions.
 - Traditional telephony services including contact / service centres and business telephony service revenues are likely to shrink over the coming few years.

3. Connected Security:
 - Summary: The cybersecurity market is an exciting growth area which holds significant potential for $LUMN. However, it remains a small % of overall revenues and so revenue growth in-line with industry expectation will not materially impact the overall value of $LUMN.
 - If $LUMN can leverage their verticals in the datacentre / cloud space to cross sell their security services this could see some reasonably large growth, but overall due to the small footprint of $LUMN in the cloud space presently, material value growth due to this vertical is likely be several years out.
 - Additionally, $LUMN is not a recognised global player in this industry unlike Akamai or NetScout, and so will be at a disadvantage compared to incumbents with higher profile portfolios.

4. Edge Computing:
 - Summary: This could be a strong growth area for $LUMN. Could be a way to take advantage of the potentially significant growth area of Edge computing. However, it is likely to significantly materialise only 1-2 years out with little revenue growth in this area prior to then as organisations slowly accept this paradigm shift. Additionally, it will be a highly competitive area that will require significant investment to grow and maintain an advantage.
 - As of 23 Feb 2021, $LUMN claims they provide 60% of enterprise locations with <5ms latency to edge nodes. Their goal is 90% by the end of the year and their large fiber network leaves them at an advantage compared to competitors. (See Adaptive Networking).
 - An example from the 4Q20 earnings call was SAP using their Edge infrastructure to bring SaaS applications closer to customers and bypassing unnecessary internet traversal.
 - While $LUMN can leverage its underlying infrastructure and assets to push a solid offering, this is likely to be a highly competitive space with players including typical cloud service providers e.g. Microsoft, Amazon, Google and HPE as well as specialised players e.g. Mutable. Large cloud players will have both the hardware and software required to compete effectively with $LUMN while also being able to leverage their substantial public cloud technologies to gain an advantage.

5. Hybrid Cloud: 
 - Summary: If you are interested in taking advantage of private or public cloud growth then Lumen probably is not the best value even at its current multiple. This is due to low revenues (as a % of total revenues) from Cloud related activities. Additionally, this space is highly competitive and $LUMN does not appear to have the background or experience (it is working on growing its employee expertise) although they can potentially take advantage of their underlying infrastructure from their fiber and physical assets.
 - Personally, I believe Private Cloud is not a significantly growing area with potentially some shorter term increase due to pandemic pushing a more remote working / access focus. However, longer term 3-5 years out, I think hybrid cloud will be the dominant focus as organisations transition from private cloud to increased public cloud usage. Only 3% of enterprises use private cloud exclusively^(24).
 - If you are going to opt for growth within public cloud, there are higher growth options with AMZN, GOOG and MSFT although these are substantially higher in price. Alternatively, Cisco, HPE, or other smaller providers may work. A dedicated cloud provider will likely provide better value than $LUMN due to the low revenue share (see above).

I am do not have any position with $LUMN at the time of posting. Past performance is not indicative of future returns or results, and your investment can go up as well as down. Do your own due diligence before hopping on reddit trends please.",52,0.86
2021-02-22 14:23:02,"Why I'm skeptical of the advice that ""you should just stick to index funds"".","**1.**

A lot of studies can be very misleading. Especially if you just look at them at a surface level without examining whether or not they even apply to you.

For example a lot of these studies claim the average retail investor returns is **2.1%**. Which I highly doubt is the same average as this sub or anyone that takes a serious interest in investing, because lot of those studies are looking at *everyone*. From day traders, to swing traders to people who don’t know basic tenants such as time in the market beats timing the market. If you don’t day trade, if you don’t invest only for the short term and don’t try to time the market, why would you look at a study where a significant portion of the population is doing exactly that?

That’s like looking at a study that says the average person is Chinese and then concluding that the next 10 people you meet will also most likely be Chinese when you live in a state like Mississippi.

But more importantly i think the 2.1% average ties into the fact that many of those studies are also examining a time period where **most retail investors did not use the internet to the same capacity they’re using it today**.  One glaringly obvious example is that communities and tools such as Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, investopedia, finviz, and Glassdoor, either did not exist or did not yet mature to the same level of sophistication that they're at right now.

I don’t think it’s possible to overestimate how much of an impact that the internet has been in empowering retail investors. And this is just a recent phenomena too, which I think invalidates a lot of past data.

**2.**

*But studies show that professional fund managers also underperform over 15+ years. Therefore what makes you think you’ll do any better?*

Actually fund managers have quite a few large handicaps compared to retail investors.

One being that it’s much harder to generate alpha when you’re managing 10s of billions of dollars. Fund managers have rules and regulations that they’re forced to follow and many can only allocate a small percentage of their portfolios in their “top 5 ideas” due to risk management policies. Many aren’t even trying to beat the market but are staying within their own benchmarks they’ve set for their customers, and for this reason they’re mostly doing short term trading. As retail investors we are not bound by any of these handicaps.

As Warren Buffet said ""Investing is the only field in the world where the amateur can very likely do better than the professional. As long as they are self aware that they are in fact amateurs."" and ""When I was younger I had more ideas than money, now that I'm managing hundreds of billions of. dollars I have more money than ideas.""

I’m not saying that you *shouldn’t* invest in index funds at all. I’m just saying that the arguments I’ve read about why you should be 100% in index funds seem shallow and may not be applicable to a lot of people in this subreddit or people who take a serious interest in investing.",12,0.68

2021-03-05 13:31:12,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, March 5, 2021.","After falling steeply in the morning, the major indices reversed to finish firmly in the green as market participants digested the Labor Department February Unemployment report, rising Treasury yields, and developments surrounding stimulus. 

The US added back the most jobs in four months in February, as falling coronavirus cases, an increase in the pace of vaccinations, and easing social distancing guidelines are allowing many businesses to reopen. Non-farm payrolls rose by 379,000 in February, or well above the 200,000 expected. The unemployment rate dipped to 6.2%, unexpectedly improving compared to January's 6.3%. The February jobs report also included a notable upward revision to payroll. January’s payroll gain was revised up to 166,000 from the tepid 49,000 previously reported.

In response to the positive jobs reports, Treasury yields rose once again to hover near its one-year high. The 10-year Treasury yield hit a high of 1.6% today before dipping to 1.557% at the time of writing. As a reminder, high expectations of economic growth causes Treasury yields to rise as the demand for bonds drops in order to make them more attractive. 

Rising interest rates hurt high-growth stocks the most because high-growth companies generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now.

During a public appearance Thursday afternoon, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday that the central bank will be “patient” in keeping interest rates near zero, even if inflationary pressures start to rise. Powell cautioned that as the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues, the Fed could see signs of rising prices amid surging consumer spending. But the Fed chairman noted that he does not expect higher inflation to turn into anything resembling the double-digit inflation of the 1970s. He said, “If we do see what we believe is likely a transitory increase in inflation, where longer-term inflation expectations are broadly stable at levels consistent with our framework and goals, I expect that we will be patient.”

Texas said Tuesday that it was lifting its mask requirement and would allow businesses to fully reopen, the most expansive step by any state to remove coronavirus restrictions as Americans across the country are eager to emerge after a year of isolation in the pandemic. 

Senate Democrats struck a last-minute agreement Friday to set federal unemployment benefits at $300 a week, down from the $400 passed by the House, but extend their duration by more than a month as part of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, according to a Democratic aide. Democrats hope to pass the bill before the mid-March cliff where enhanced federal unemployment benefits from the previous relief package expire.

2021-01-31 04:32:17,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. I've displayed the most 'popular' tickers on whichever sub-reddit the post may have originated from. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

Feel free to cite hard data but even general statements like (I don't think ___ will do well in this environment b/c of budget cuts, etc.) are fine.

TLDR: Asking for opinion, not for people to do research for me.

The continuous rise in bond yields is raising concerns about equity valuations and a pickup in inflation.

2021-02-12 11:10:02,Why BlackBerry is NOT a Meme Stock,"I've been seeing some well-written posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/li0rpg/blackberry_a_dormant_giant/) one and [this as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lfuoe9/bb_is_not_a_phone_company_heres_some_dd/), as I'm sure you have as well. It seems like people are finally starting to realize that BlackBerry, in fact, **is NOT a meme stock.**

You might ask, why is that? Well, here are a few of their partnerships and products that they're developing (and have *already* developed):

\- Partnership with Amazon: On December 1st, [BB announced a multi-year agreement ](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform#:~:text=OverviewContact%20Us-,AWS%20and%20BlackBerry%20Join%20Forces%20to%20Accelerate,New%20Intelligent%20Vehicle%20Data%20Platform&text=SEATTLE%2C%20WA%20and%20WATERLOO%2C%20ON,%2C%20Amazon%20Web%20Services%2C%20Inc.)with AWS, which is Amazon’s cloud service business. The agreement plans to develop and market BlackBerry's Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform, IVY. BlackBerry IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud. Automakers can use this information to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences.

* Partnership with Baidu: On January 25, BB announced the [expansion](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology) of its strategic partnership with [Baidu](http://iv.baidu.com/), whose high-definition maps will run on the [QNX® Neutrino® Real-time](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-neutrino-rtos) Operating System (RTOS) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of [GAC Group](https://www.gac-motor.com/) (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.). The milestones build on the company’s [January 2018](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/blackberry-and-baidu-partnering-to-accelerate-connected-and-autonomous-vehicle-technology) agreement to make BlackBerry QNX's industry-leading operating system (OS) the foundation for Baidu's ‘Apollo’ autonomous driving open platform.
* BlackBerry QNX: BlackBerry is entering into the auto industry by using their QNX real-time operating system that is already built into over 175 million vehicles today and is already being used by automakers like Audi, BMW, Subaru, Volkswagen, GM, Toyota, and Honda. NVIDIA is even building its AI self-driving platform off of BlackBerry’s QNX technology.
* BlackBerry IVY: [In addition to the QNX](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/investors-overreacting-blackberry-deal-with-amazon/) Operating System, their partnership with AWS allows them to store all of this vehicle data through BlackBerry Ivy, which is a cloud-based software platform that allows these automakers to view data and insights for their vehicles.
* BlackBerry Spark: Another major service that BlackBerry offers is its Unified Endpoint Security, which is a comprehensive security approach to endpoint security that is essential to protect against and remediate cyber threats while providing visibility across all endpoints. Through their UES, they plan on improving **cross-platform visibility, cyber threat prevention, and remediation,** while **simplifying administration.**

**Okay, so why is this important?**

1. BlackBerry QNX was created to expand and improve autonomous driving vehicles and is currently being used in over 175 *million* vehicles.
2. BlackBerry IVY helps these automakers (Audi, BMW, Ford, etc) view data and insights on their vehicles. This means that if there is a recall on a vehicle, even like a problem with the sensors, **the automakers can find that issue much faster and quite possibly even fix it through a software update.**
3. They are REVOLUTIONIZING the automobile industry because of these two products. \*\*In the future, we could see a shift from hardware-driven vehicles to software-defined vehicles.\*\*
4. Not only are they focusing on this, but they also have successfully created cybersecurity software that received the **HIGHEST score in the industry for the Enterprise** [**Unmanaged/BYO use case**](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/09/blackberry-achieves-highest-score-in-gartner-critical-capabilities-report-for-unmanaged-byo-use-case)**.**

Gartner Research (who published the study) even placed BlackBerry higher than VMWare, IBM, and MSFT basically signaling that their products and services are better than their competitors. In fact, NONE of BlackBerry's customers that use BlackBerry Guard were affected by the SolarWinds hack. And the stock price is still $12.

**The Sobering Part of this DD:**

After taking a look at their balance sheet, I can agree with the skeptics that they’re not raking in a ton of money right now, but anyone can see that their current balance sheet makes the company appear to be undervalued, especially when compared to their competitors.

I mean, based on this information ALONE, the price of the stock should be much higher than it is right now. BlackBerry's current market cap is around $7 billion, with its competitors like Palantir, a software company that I’m sure you’ve heard other YouTubers talk about, hovering at 60 billion. And funny enough, Palantir is also focusing their software on electric vehicles and cybersecurity, just like BlackBerry. **If BlackBerry had the same market cap as Palantir, its stock price would be $110.**

**Final Thoughts:**

Here’s what the skeptics don’t realize though. They don’t realize that BB is still very focused on product development and customer acquisition, and that boomers probably still think it’s a phone company. Well, it’s not.

With their partnership with Amazon, Baidu, their UES and UEM product known as BlackBerry Spark, BlackBerry IVY, and their QNX operating system for vehicles, it seems like the market is not correctly pricing in BlackBerry’s **future growth**.

Maybe one day if BlackBerry receives the same amount of hype that Palantir is getting right now, maybe then it’ll be taken much more seriously. **But only, once people realize that it’s not a meme stock.**",215,0.85
2021-03-10 13:40:23,Thoughts on T,"With the rampant volatility in tech stocks over the last month I’ve begun to consider alternative sectors that have yet to recover from the COVID Crash. Looking for some safer assets to anchor my portfolio that consists of stocks like AMD, MSFT, and ICLN, I peeked into dividend heavy assets and came across AT&T. While the 7% dividend yield is huge I’m curious if there are underlying flaws that I’m overlooking that are keeping this telecom giant at a fraction of where it sat a year ago. It seems like if we shift to a value driven market, T will be due for some positive momentum . Please tell me why this idea is ludicrous and I’m an idiot!! 

Thanks 🙏

Edit:

Thanks for all the replies everyone! Consensus seems to be that I am indeed delusional and if I’m after a safe dividend stock there are better options out there. Much appreciated!!",11,0.84

I want to start investing 401k and other retirement funds. I have my own savings to invest as well. What are the earnings and growth opportunities, we are expecting for next 1- 5 years.

I think, AMZN has lot of growth potential with all in one package (retail, fmcg, Streaming and AWS). How big AWS going to be in terms of contributing AMZN market cap.

AAPL has still long way to go in terms of selling phones and other stuff. They are like windows of mobile phones. They are even replacing windows in laptops. They own mobile domain.

GOOG has lot of ad revenues. I am not too sure about all the other stuff they do.

I am not sure about MSFT story. It is growing into cloud space. They missed big time in mobile space like Intel. They have strong office suit and windows. I think, they have big windows stack/servers for enterprise applications.

I am also thinking about COSTCO. It has nice concept of selling limited skus in big quantities. It has its own private label which can be as big as P&G.

Am i understanding these stories correctly? Please feel to correct me and give me some numbers and future earning/market cap potential.

First time investor - looking at ETFs. I realized instead of buying the 5 stocks mentioned above, maybe I can look at a etf that has good exposure to all 5. I plan to buy and play long, 

I looked around and of course saw the usual suspects - VOO, QQQ, SPY, XLK seemed like good options and their leveraged ones TQQQ/TECL. I so far like SKYY the most as it has Citrix VMware BABA etc. But not as much exposure as I'd like to the big guys, also Is there a leveraged SKYY version? 

However most of the above seem to have APPL as the first/second most invested stock (except Skyy) while I would like it to be Googl Amzn or MSFT as the top 3 exposed. Any ideas please which ETF does this ?

2021-03-10 23:30:22,Short Term Investing Advice,"I’ll try and keep this as short as possible with a little background since it’s a specific circumstance. My Mom is a Financial Advisor of 25+ years and has raised me to invest, buy and hold, diversify, etc. She doesn’t buy individual stocks and only invests in Mutual Funds and ETF’s mostly because my Mom and Dad’s age (65/60) and risk level. I always had her put me in Science and Technology and it’s done very well to say the least. I am generally knowledgeable of the market and understand the risks involved.

I am now 26 and working from home. I work in Sales for a TV sports network and make $80,000/yr. I have a stable income. I am obviously much riskier than my Mom and currently have $54,000 in shares of extremely high risk,  volatile stocks (TTD, AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, ABNB, FSLY, PINS, FB, PYPL, SE, SHOP, SQ, MELI, DDOG, ARKK) and around 25 more tech, e-commerce, and infrastructure stocks. The problem is I had saved $30,000 the past year and bought a lot of tech last Monday. Needless to say it got bumpy and my Mom offered me a deal when my account got to $48,000 (16% in 2 days):

Now for the StoNKs advice:

DEAL: Guaranteed my $61,000 original investment if I do not invest any more money this year and simply hold investments of some kind until the end of the year. IF they are above $61,000 at the end of the year, we will split any profits 50/50. 

I am looking to buy a house the beginning of next year so this is around a 6-9 month window. What stocks would you invest in for the remainder of 2021? Would you be extremely risky and tech heavy since that money is guaranteed anyways?

EDIT 1: All financial advice will be considered and evaluated, definitely no guarantees, but my thought process is, if the money is technically guaranteed then I should be in tech/growth for the risk/reward. My Mom agrees with the tech part in Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, but is weary of the growth stocks that ran in 2020 for valid reasons.",6,0.88

About half my portfolio are ETFs (some VOO, ARK funds, ICLN, TAN) and the remainder in the the more common MSFT, AMD, NVIDIA, TSLA, NIO, ev charging. I’m getting pretty disheartened about the last couple of weeks. I’m still up 6% from when I started but my ATH was a 32% gain. I trimmed a handful of positions the other day, especially the more volatile stocks and ate the 30%-40% losses. 

I’ve been through some of the corrections with I’ll placed deposits, namely in September immediately after I put in 15k just before the dip. And my last deposit was another 15k just before this dip. 

I guess I have another question about the outlook of these stocks longer term.  Would an “established” stock that’s overvalued that corrects bounce back to the previous ath levels

I think of my AAPL MSFT as pretty worry free investments with maybe modest growth in the future
Of course no one knows what's going to happen. I realize they've both returned very well over last decade.

Although they've done very well over the last decade,  I'm not sure how much they'll grow in the future.  I hope at least 10% a year.

Anyways when people say buy the dip what do they mean exactly?  How much do you let it dip and how much do you buy in that case?

Also, should I be buying dips in these 2 if they're already 17% of my portfolio?

Or should I rather be buying dips in my SQ and PYPL since they MAY grow more in the future?

2021-02-21 06:45:08,Why I just went long on Big Tobacco.,"TL;DR at bottom.

Obligatory notice: I'm not totally clueless, but am new to this, so take what I say with a grain of salt.  This is not financial advice.  I think it will be good for me to see if I can explain my position.  Feel free to poke holes in it, disagree, or reassure me if you think I'm on to something.

So: as part of my new portfolio, I put about 25% into Big Tobacco.  My positions are in **MO, PM, BTI, IMBBY, JAPAY**, and **UVV**. These are the 5 largest tobacco companies in the world, and also a grower.

Why, would you ask?  Smoking rates are on the decline!  Tobacco is on the way out!  It's amoral!

&#x200B;

**Why I Like These Stocks**

Firstly, I am a former smoker (it's been several years and no plans on returning).  The good news is that it was fairly easy for me to quit once I really started getting my life together.  Let's just say I had a bit of a troubled past, and once I started fixing all that getting off the cigs was just the next obvious thing.  The bad news?  I still have a sort of fascination with smoking.  I don't want to go back to it, as I said, I'm much better off without it.  But I swear that stuff is crazy addictive.  Maybe that's why I personally like this stock, it's some sort of proxy for my fascination.  But at the same time, it's good business.  We all know that smoking is addictive, but I think people who have never smoked or never smoked regularly underestimate how powerful it is.  This is one big reason why I like these stocks: I don't think they're going away any time soon, despite what people say.

&#x200B;

**Smoking Isn't Going Away**

Here's a [resource](https://www.who.int/tobacco/en/atlas38.pdf) from the WHO to back this up.  Not the best one because I can't figure out when it was published, so I'm not sure from which point on we're projecting.  But data from the WHO [here](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tobacco), published May 2020, says there were 1.3 billion people smoking at that time.  Just 100 million less than the conservative estimate in the original chart.  So we're more or less on track with that number, albeit with a bit of a loss for tobacco companies.  Anyway: if those predictions hold up, by 2040-2050 we will still have between 1.5 and 2.2 billion smokers worldwide.  Even if we use the conservative estimate (1.5) and divided it by the projected population in 2045 (9 billion), we come up with a projected rate of 16.67% by 2045.  Curiously enough, if we do the same calculation for the May 2020 date (1.3 billion smokers divided by 7.8 billion pop), we come up with the exact same rate: 16.67%. I'm not sure why the numbers differ, but a 2020 study [here](https://www.statista.com/topics/1600/smoking/#:~:text=Currently%2C%20around%2019%20percent%20of,expected%20to%20continue%20doing%20so) tells us that the rate is 19%.  More than what I calculated based on WHO data.

Either way, the projections are that by 2040-2050 the worldwide smoking rate will be **the same** (conservative estimate) or **higher** (if we use the WHO's upper estimate of 2.2 billion in 2025, with 9 billion pop. = 24.45%).  Smoking is not going anywhere in the immediate future.

&#x200B;

**Smoking In The Developing World**

More data and info: smoking may be on the decline in the first world, but it's significantly increasing in developing countries.  I watched a great 2-part documentary about this on YouTube a couple of months ago (this sub does not let me link it, if you're interested drop me a comment and I will provide the link).  This was actually before I started investing.  It's a great watch apart from investing... just interesting for anyone interested in the topic including the morality of it.  But once I started investing I immediately remembered it because of what they said about smoking picking up in developing countries. Let me give you some easy data that confirms this, from [this](https://ash.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tobacco-Developing-World.pdf) study:

""Levels of cigarette consumption in the European and American WHO regions decreased by 33% and 44% respectively between 1980 and 2016. In that same time consumption in the Eastern Mediterranean and African WHO regions – where the majority of low-income countries (LICs) are found – saw increases of 65% and 52%, respectively.""

Don't forget Asia, either.  Check out this graph [here](https://www.nationthailand.com/aec/30325358).  (For our purposes we have to discount China because China Tobacco has a virtual monopoly on the market there)

&#x200B;

**But what about people who quit, people who die, litigation, etc.?**

I'd also make a strong argument that, no matter what happens in the next 50 years in regards to legislation, settlements, etc., most of those people are going to be lifelong consumers.  Let's see:

""According to a 2015 survey, about **70 percent** of current adult smokers in the United States wanted to quit, and although about **55 percent** had attempted to do so in the past year, only **7 percent** were successful in quitting for 6-12 months "" [source](https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/health-information/quitting-smoking-closer-every-attempt#:~:text=According%20to%20a%202015%20survey,quitting%20for%206%2D12%20months)

And I'd make an argument that it's *easier* for US smokers to quit, since the quality of life in the US is better on average than in other countries.  They don't have to worry about so many things and can just focus on quitting.  Still, they don't seem to be able to.

But of course, many consumers will die due to their habit, too. A recent study showed that a shocking 67% percent of smokers will die due to smoking-related illnesses ([source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/02/26/the-terrifying-rate-at-which-smokers-die-from-smoking/)).  Not good business.  However, the CDC says that ""life expectancy for smokers is at least 10 years shorter than for nonsmokers."" ([source](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/tobacco_related_mortality/index.htm)).  Chilling, but as far as business is concerned, 10 years is a lot better than 30.  And we all know that smoking doesn't kill people overnight.  It takes some time.  So despite losing customers due to smoking-related illness, the effect isn't immediate.  And absolutely none of this discounts the data that I presented before which shows that smoking rates will remain steady by 2040-2050.

Another issue is that developing countries will crack down on smoking like we already have in the US and Europe.  But despite the US being pretty tough on things, in 2020 14.6% of adults aged 18–44 years stilled smoked, and 16.5% of adults aged 45–64 years ([source](https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/leading-health-indicators/2020-lhi-topics/Tobacco/data#:~:text=14.6%25%20among%20adults%20aged%2018,twice%20the%20best%20group%20rate)).  That's not much lower than our global estimate for 2040-2050.

I'd also like to speculate that with new issues coming up like climate change, pandemics, overpopulation, lack of resources, etc. governments won't be spending nearly as much time addressing the tobacco problem.

There's also the issue of litigations and settlements in both developed and developing countries.  What I just stated about new issues like climate change also will affect that.  But even if it does not, Big Tobacco has always recovered from this sort of litigation. Just read the abstract of this study of the Master Settlement Agreement [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8162097_Impacts_of_the_Master_Settlement_Agreement_on_the_Tobacco_Industry).

""The experience during the post-MSA period demonstrates that the MSA did no major harm to the companies. Some features of the MSA appear to have increased company value and profitability.""

If this didn't put a dent in Big Tobacco, I don't think much will.

&#x200B;

**Innovation**

Tobacco companies are also exploring new areas like cannabis (MO and BAT) as well as vaping (all tobacco companies).  Altria (MO) also has a significant position in Anheuser-Busch.  These companies are diversifying.  They could be leaders in the developing vaping and cannabis industries.  I'm going to avoid giving data on all of this, because, to be honest, I still like the looks of the smoking business.

I don't necessarily expect any of these companies to boom thanks to cannabis or vaping, but if they are able to position themselves properly then it is most certainly a possibility.  They're big, established companies with established infrastructure and manufacturing... one could argue that they're in a great position to capitalize on these new markets.  That's not the main reason I'm long, but it is a nice bonus.

I think it's also worth nothing that the tobacco companies are trying to give themselves a clean image.  They focus on things like ""less-risky products"" (vaping, CBD, etc.) which make it look like they're somehow socially responsible or something.  They're not, but it's a good image to give off to governments and investors.

&#x200B;

**Individual Companies**

I've decided to invest in all 5 because I'm not convinced that any one is necessarily better than the other.  Remember that tobacco is about 25% of my total portfolio, and I will break that bit down from there.

**Altria (MO**) - I've got about 25% of my tobacco holdings in Altria.  I like them because they look like they're innovating strongly, and also have a good P/E ratio and steady or increasing revenue.  I don't like them because they only sell to the US, and I really like the prospects of international tobacco.  Still worth a buy.

**Phillip Morris International** **(PM)** \- Another 25%.  I like them because they're an established company with wide access to international markets.  I don't like them because their P/E is quite high and revenue declined slightly in 2020.  But still a huge contender and worth a buy.

**British American Tobacco (BTI)** \- Another 25%.  I like them because they've got the broadest exposure to international markets.  Great P/E ratio, and revenue has been increasing.  Also talk about them going into CBD.

**Imperial Brands (IMBBY)** \- About 7.5%.  They seem to be underperforming a bit, but revenue has increased slightly or remained steady.  They're not diversified much and are focusing mostly on tobacco.  Their market is mainly focused on Europe.  I don't like missing out on developing countries, but I do like that more people smoke in Europe than in the States.  I didn't want to miss out on a small stake with them, just in case.

**Japan Tobacco** **(JAPAY)** \- About 4%.  Revenue was down this year and is projected to be down again in 2021.  I don't like that.  I do like that they're *heavy* in Asia, and also that they sell the famed Camel brand outside of the USA.  Small positions because of the revenue and possibly management issues. But I didn't want to miss out on that international exposure.

**Universal Corp (UVV)** \- The remaining 15%\~ or so.  They are a huge seller of tobacco leaves.  I wanted to diversify a bit and get away from the manufactures themselves and just stick to the raw product (tobacco).  I don't think this will grow much in the long-term, but also won't go under or disappoint.

In sum, I wanted a stake in pretty much all of them for different reasons.  If things go south for one company, I've still got my stake in the others.  And if one company overperforms, I've got that as well.

Another one I like is **Turning Point Brands** **(TPB)**, which is making strong moves in the cannabis and vaping markets. They traditionally did smokeless tobacco and Zig Zag papers.  I did not buy them because I feel they're riding the cannabis stock hype and are a bit overvalued at present.  I will consider buying if a dip comes.

&#x200B;

**What I Expect From This**

I don't expect massive growth from these stocks.  If you're looking for growth, look elsewhere.  But I do expect stable, long-term returns from my diversified portfolio. And don't forget the **dividends,** which range from about **5-10%** on all of these companies.

I've got pretty much the rest of my portfolio in an S+P 500 index fund and tech stocks (MSFT, etc.)  The index fund is just for steady income, and the tech stocks are where I expect to have some real growth.

Note that I'm a conservative investor and just starting out, so I didn't want to YOLO my money into anything that could cost me. I don't think tobacco is going to cost me.  If anything, I think it's going to provide medium to medium-high returns in the long-term.  What's more, I see it as recession proof.  I feel a correction coming and I didn't want to go too heavy into tech or growth stocks.  If this had been in May of last year, I may have felt justified in doing so.  But now I feel I've come a bit too late to the party.  When the inevitable correction comes, I'll buy the dips on some more tech and growth stocks, but I will also have my tobacco investments sitting pretty there.

There is slight risk in going long on Big Tobacco at the moment.  Despite the data, who knows?  The world could have a change of heart.  Smoking *is* declining.  But I think the data is clear that it won't be significant or any time soon.  Apart from that, there's the opportunity cost.  I could have invested in something with a better looking future.  But tobacco, IMO, is quite safe, and for a conservative investor it's a pretty good place to put a good chunk of your portfolio.

&#x200B;

**Moral Concerns**

The DD I wrote reads like an anti-smoking campaign.  This stuff sucks.  It kills.  I wish it didn't exist.

But the fact is, it does.  And I'm not an institutional investor pouring millions into it.  The money I have invested is a million times less than a drop in a pond.  It's nothing.  It won't change anything.  So I don't feel guilty about making some returns on it.

Funnily enough, I do kind of have a thing against defense stocks.  Smoking will kill you, yes, but it's not immediate and there is an argument that you get some pleasure out of it.  Guns just kill you straight up.  I don't know if I'm okay with that, no matter how small my investment. But as for smoking?  As a small investor, I'm OK with it.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR / The Bottom Line:**

Big Tobacco isn't going anywhere any time soon.  Smoking rates are going down in the developed world but in developing countries they're actually going up.  I don't think tobacco stocks are going to make anyone big money, but they're fairly safe investments that will continue to provide steady returns and dividends in the long-term.  The companies are also innovating and one or more may even score big in the vaping or cannabis markets.  Finally, they're cheap right now, too.

Apart from the moral issue, can't really go wrong, IMO.",5,0.56
