That's

- Crispr Therapeutics 
- Editas Medicine 
- Beam Therapeutics 

I currently have 3% of my account in CRSP. Bummed today when it went down while EDIT and BEAM soared. 

I realize that ETFs might be great but they don't offer the type of high risk / high reward play I'm going for. I just want to try to find the next Amazon -- something that has a ~10% chance at being 100 billion in 5 years.",2,1.0
2021-04-06 02:40:46,"['GO', 'GOOG', 'PT', 'SP']",What are your SpaceX moves? ARKX vs BPTRX vs SPCE vs GOOG vs waiting for SpaceX IPO to go public...,"I'm trying to figure out the best way to invest in SpaceX and I keep seeing so many varying opinions on it. (I've only been investing for less than a year, so I am still learning and looking to be educated.) I figured I'd wait until their IPO when public and then grab however many shares I could afford to lose. I own some Google and know they have about 9%, but some people are saying it's better to hold BPTRX or SPCE or ARKZ and I don't know enough about these companies to pick and choose. Or do I just chill out and wait for the SpaceX IPO and then buy whole shares? I want in on this Starlink stuff! I really appreciate you taking time to help me out.",8,0.9
