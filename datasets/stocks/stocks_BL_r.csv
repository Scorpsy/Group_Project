2021-04-06 10:06:20,['BL'],BlackRock (BLK) holdings look similar to ETFs like QQQ and Vanguard's MGK. Buy BLK instead of these popular ETFs?,"Top holdings are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon Google Facebook etc.  These are almost identical to QQQ and MGK.  


BLK also includes Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan and some other non-tech companies so it's probably more diversified sector-wise than QQQ and MGK.


I'm just wondering if anyone has chosen to put a large chunk of their portfolio into BLK over one of the popular ETFs like QQQ.  My thought process is that they are a big money institutional investor.  They  make money selling their own ETFs etc.  I'm just a small retail investor with no special insight or power of my own.  I can't beat them, but I can join them.",23,0.69
