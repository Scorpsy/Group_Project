2021-03-31 09:35:36,$PLTR: Let's do a quick compare to GOOG in 2004,"At the end of 2004, GOOG had delivered $3.1B in revenues and 54% gross margin. The company was valued in the public markets at $50 billion, or 16x sales. It was considered highly expensive by most regular investors. Holders from then have made 15x in 16 years as revenues have grown 60x.

PLTR is currently valued at $41 billion. It is likely to hit $3b in sales - like GOOG in 2004 - in 2 years. PLTR has gross margins of 80%. It is one of the best businesses that has ever existed on planet Earth. This simple comparison should be enough to own PLTR today with the plan to hold it for at least a decade, regardless of short term volatility. 

I am not an avid tech investor. I have few tech names and I tend to trade them but I expect the $50,000 I am putting into PLTR today to be almost $1 million in 15 years.",0,0.41
2021-03-30 18:03:59,Buy 3 shares GOOG. Am I nuts?,"Is it nuts to put 5% of my portfolio in GOOG?  Or should I just get 1 share and wait for a possible pullback ... That may not come?

I already have 19% across AAPL and MSFT with approx. 11.5% AAPL and 8% MSFT.  

I know you're ""not supposed to sell AAPL "" (Cramer ðŸ˜†)...  but should I sell some AAPL to put in GOOG?  Or just buy GOOG?

I have enough cash for 4 shares, but I'd rather not overweight GOOG.

My reasoning for GOOG is the obvious I suppose plus it's supposedly part of the re-opening (whatever that really means lol).

Or should I just do some partial shares of GOOG?  Do you see it going down at all?

If I add GOOG though my tech weighting will be up around 65% I think.

I really don't wanna get rid of MSFT or too much AAPL.  I'm cost basis 90 @50 shares AAPL and 20 shares @ 202 on MSFT.

2021-04-06 02:40:46,"['GO', 'GOOG', 'PT', 'SP']",What are your SpaceX moves? ARKX vs BPTRX vs SPCE vs GOOG vs waiting for SpaceX IPO to go public...,"I'm trying to figure out the best way to invest in SpaceX and I keep seeing so many varying opinions on it. (I've only been investing for less than a year, so I am still learning and looking to be educated.) I figured I'd wait until their IPO when public and then grab however many shares I could afford to lose. I own some Google and know they have about 9%, but some people are saying it's better to hold BPTRX or SPCE or ARKZ and I don't know enough about these companies to pick and choose. Or do I just chill out and wait for the SpaceX IPO and then buy whole shares? I want in on this Starlink stuff! I really appreciate you taking time to help me out.",8,0.9
