I found an excellent writeup/summary which touched all the important points and thought it would be useful here, which I'll summarize below.

**Novavax's vaccine is crazy effective, cheap to make, and easy to transport.**

""The way Novavax’ vaccine works is different even from the ones previously mentioned and approved for use in the United States. NVX-CoV2373 (the formal name for their vaccine) is a protein-based subunit vaccine candidate engineered from the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine was created using Novavax’ recombinant nanoparticle technology to generate antigens derived from the coronavirus spike (S) protein. It is adjuvanted 4 with Novavax’ patented saponin-based Matrix-MTM which enhances the immune response and stimulates high levels of neutralizing antibodies. This vaccine candidate does require two doses, spaced three weeks apart. ""

"" Second-generation vaccines, of which Novavax is one, are identified based on their potential to provide protection with a single dose, exhibit stability in greater temperature ranges, remain stable throughout the manufacturing process, yield an improved or differentiated immune response, and use a diverse range of antigens. They are historically cheaper and have had higher levels of efficacy and safety. ""

**They already have over a 200 million orders and they have a worldwide supply chain and distribution already set up.**

""To date, Novavax has increased its projected global manufacturing production rate of NVX-CoV2373 to be over two billion annualized doses when they’re at full capacity, which is expected to occur in mid-2021. Of this anticipated capacity, approximately one billion doses will be manufactured by the Serum Institute of India Private Limited (SIIPL). Novavax has developed partnerships with entities across the globe to increase its manufacturing capacity and vaccine supplies ""

""Novavax has entered into advanced purchase agreements with various countries globally that, if the vaccine is approved, are expected to result in the delivery of approximately 200 million doses of NVX-CoV2373 throughout 2021 and into the first half of 2022 ""

**It looks like coronavirus is not going away, so people will continue to need boosters and shots to take care of the variant strains.**

""From what I’ve learned about Novavax, they seem to be well-positioned to give COVID-19 the knockout punch. Their underlying recombinant nanoparticle technology has the ability to accurately target viral pathogens and create protein antigens organized around a polysorbate-based nanoparticle core, the assembly of which resembles the native presentation of the pathogen being targeted. This process creates highly-immunogenic, long-lasting, yet safe, vaccines that can tackle not only COVID-19 and its variant strains, but also a wide variety of other disease organisms. One of Novavax’ near-term clinical development work is evaluating the viability of certain combination vaccines, which, if successful, could potentially lead to a seasonal 3-in-1 or 2-in-1 vaccine shot that would take care of influenza, COVID-19, and RSV ""

TLDR: Honestly, no company has the combination of (1) 90%+ efficacy, (2) easy transport and storage, and (3) easy modification like Novavax does. I think this vaccine, along with Pfizer/BioNTech (which I owned last year) will end up the big winner from all this. Moderna is behind Pfizer, AstraZeneca is an absolute mess (the clots appear to be real), and Johnson & Johnson is simply not all that effective.

Price targets on eTrade on average are $323, that's 74% upside. Catalysts coming in April (UK) and May (US). Obviously, all vaccine plays carry risk, but there's no logical reason for the recent downward pressure on NVAX's price. It's part of my well-diversified portfolio.
