More realistically, taking the average from the lowest four puts the share price at $50.75.

Paysafe is the number 1 digital wallet in Igaming, Draftkings uses them, and most recently they just partnered with Coinbase. As all SPACs do now, it sold off big today with the ticker change so there has never been a better time to buy than now! 

Note : I’m long PSFE with 3,350 shares @15.47
