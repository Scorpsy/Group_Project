PACB is a Gene-sequencing company. Gene-sequencing is about reading and learning genes. Its able to locate abnormallities/deviations in gene, leading to diagnosing rare diseases or finding a way to fix known diseases that yet need a solution. (fixing diabetes for example)

Gene sequencing is what makes gene editing possible. (Gene-editing is where you change your genes, that can cure disease or atleast treat a disease) All though Gene-editing is still quite new, a combination of these sciences could change the world and its healthcare.

‘’Ok cool.. but Pacbio isnt the only company doing this.’’

That is true, what makes PACB special is that not only are they global leader on long read sequencing technology. They massively improved gene sequencing, called Hi-Fi ‘’smart sequencing’’. Which is the most accurate long read sequencing technology on the market.

Their flagship model Sequel lle has $700 cost savings per human genome, has a 90% reduction in data storage needs and has around 75% reduction in data analysis time.

What I really like is that their new CEO Christain Henry is a businessman. PACB’s number one objective is to expand their global reach, the sale force has doubled this year and PACB is more  focussed on marketing and customer support to enable growth. They also received a 900million dollar of Softbank to accelerate their growth regarding product development and commercial aspects and another thing that i would like to add is that Labcore is doing research on Covid-19 using PACBIO technology.

# Financials (in millions)

**Revenue (TTM):** 78 million**Cost of revenue(TTM):** 46 million**Gross profit(TTM):**  32 million

**Solvency**  
PACB has a common stock equity of $335,491 and total essets of 413,980.

335,491/413,980x100 = 81,04%. I wonderd if i calculated this right, otherwise its a great result.

**Debt to assets**  
PACB has a debt of 41,99941,999/413,980 = 10,15% which is also totally fine for me.

**Profitability**  
PACB has a net income of $29,403 if you devide that by the common stock equity of $335,491 you get a profitability of 8.7%.

**EPS**  
EPS of 0.17 TTM  
EPS of 0.18 2020  
EPS of -0.55 2019 and EPS of 0.76 in 2018.

**P/E Ratio**

Now dont fall of your chair here. The EPS is 192.82. That is a lot. However keep in mind that you are paying for a bio science company that is focussing on the future. Development takes a lot of time and also costs a lot of money. For a big company like Illumina there is a P/E of 85.

This number does not say everything, but its a nice indicator that you are buying shares for what the company COULD become. Not what they are. You are always taking a risk.

**Loose numbers**

· The company holds a total cash of $318 million

· The marketcap is 6.038 billion. The market cap of ILMN is 55.4 billion

· Their forward P/E is -44.66

· Total inside shares are 4.7 million. (around $141 million)

· 99.44% % of Shares Held by Institutions!

· ARK investment has 28,504,629 shares.

# Negatives

· The stock is extremely volatile

· Balance sheet is ok but not great

· The competition is fierce

· The investment is RISKY. No matter how you look at it.

· The companies revenue and other financials are not stable, difficult to make a guess

· The stock price has had an enormous peek already, in July 2020 the stock price was $4.73, now its $32.50 per share.

· PACBIO still has to prove themselves to be succesful in the long run, its not a safe investment, it all comes down wether you believe in them or not

· People are afraid of gene-editing because people are speculating that rich people will be able to change the genes of their unborn babies, resulting in ‘’super babies’’. (genome editing)

# Conclussion

My girlfriend is a scientist who works with DNA sequencing, so through her i got the idea to start looking into the biotech market. I really like the CEO, I like how the company is growing and the most important part: i REALLY believe that gene seqeuncing and gene editing are the future of our health system. But she might also be a reason why i am biased.

The stock is risky, im -15% as for now and there are days the stock price jumps or falls 10%. I really dislike volatile stocks but for me, the company shows A LOT of potential.

I own quite some stocks and i will defenitly increase my portfolio monthly with this stock.

I am not really recommending this stock, because honestly, this stock could either be $3 or $100 of the end of the year and its also quite expensive.. But I do suggest looking into this company. They are fundamentally strong and I really like the fact that 4.7 million shares are hold with in the company, meaning that the people working for it themselves defenitly believe in it.

**TLDR**; I like the stock but its expensive. You are buying for what the company could be, not for what they are. Biotech is quite a gamble but the company has strong fundamentals.

Now I would like to end with two things:

This is not my entire DD, I havent shared ALL of the news, didnt share everything i know about the management and about the product it has. I did not want it to be too long.

Second is that I started investing in January 2020, if i make mistakes, i really appreciate it if you point that out. Even if i make very stupid mistakes, I am eager to learn so dont hold back.",8,0.71
