ARKX vs BPTRX vs SPCE vs GOOG vs waiting for SpaceX IPO to go public...,"I'm trying to figure out the best way to invest in SpaceX and I keep seeing so many varying opinions on it. (I've only been investing for less than a year, so I am still learning and looking to be educated.) I figured I'd wait until their IPO when public and then grab however many shares I could afford to lose. I own some Google and know they have about 9%, but some people are saying it's better to hold BPTRX or SPCE or ARKZ and I don't know enough about these companies to pick and choose. Or do I just chill out and wait for the SpaceX IPO and then buy whole shares? I want in on this Starlink stuff! I really appreciate you taking time to help me out.",8,0.9
