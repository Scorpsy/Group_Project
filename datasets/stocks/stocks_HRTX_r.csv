I was doing some research to jump into the Biotech sector and noticed this seems like a good time to get in such low cost. However, I am nervous since it IPO was at like $500.

I’ve tried to do some research and haven’t been able to come up with too much to help my decision to get in or not.

Any positive feedback, DD, insight to share 
-why you’re in and like it 
-or why you don’t like it 
-and why the F did the drop like 90% since IPO


Thanks 🙏",14,0.84
