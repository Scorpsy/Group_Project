2021-02-08 04:47:25,Weekly Stock Market News🚀 | GOOG / AMZN / PINS / SQ / PYPL / COST & other Stock Market News [02-08]🚀,"**The stock market finished a terrific week at record highs🚀🚀🚀 Companies like Google, Pinterest, Amazon & others smash earnings reports while Jeff Bezos bows out🚀🚀🚀 Let’s talk about this & other stock market news**

Hello everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of last week, as we saw all 3 major indexes finish the week with big gains with the SP500 & Nasdaq Composite finishing at new record highs while the Dow Jones did also rise for 5 straight sessions. For the week the [DOW](https://imgur.com/NQpg47q) gained 3.9%, the [SP500](https://imgur.com/cY3wx9N) rose by 4.65% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://imgur.com/T5qgyg5) outperformed gaining just over 6% in what was the best week since early November 🚀🚀🚀

The Volatility [Index](https://imgur.com/Ki1RNHZ) dropped every day last week as it now seats just above 20, with this being a huge level that hasn’t been broken in a long while.

We saw all 11 [SECTORS](https://imgur.com/pp8DYTh) finish the week in the green, with Energy leading the way followed by Consumer Discretionary, Communications & Financials also gaining more than 6% 🚀

[Here](https://imgur.com/tRRK4fZ) is the HEAT MAP from last week, as we saw a hole lot of green in pretty much every sector, with big tech names gaining huge while the biggest lagging sector was Health Care. The big tech names just continue to [increase](https://imgur.com/96Q4J9w) their % of the SP market cap as technology is likely to continue to be one of the best performers in the next decades.

We also saw some interest economic data last week, as manufacturing continue to recover in January as both the [ISM](https://imgur.com/Q9ZPnxF) index and the [PMI](https://imgur.com/nVz0oDe) Index came in pretty solid and continued to stand in expansion territory.

Also, the [ISM](https://imgur.com/jgJ2IbI) Services Index came in better-than-expected rising above expectations due to an increase in employment & new orders.

In terms of Job numbers, we saw [ADP](https://imgur.com/a39dqcB) coming in way better than expected as over 170K jobs were added after a big drop in December. We also saw initial jobless [claims](https://imgur.com/ftMXubP) dropping even more than expected while the continuing jobless claims fell to under 4.6M last week.

This [WEEK](https://imgur.com/vLr3QHG) is pretty quiet in term of economic data, with core CPI, Consumer indexes and jobless numbers being the biggest ones while the [EARNINGS](https://imgur.com/PMP5olx) season continues with some of the most interesting earnings coming from Twitter, Coca-Cola, GM, Uber & PepsiCo while we also have to see how Disney subscriber numbers are continuing to evolve after hugely upgrading their expectations. One other thing that I am also interested to watch is the PayPal investors day on Thursday in which they are expected to provide a 3-to-5-year financial outlook.

In some other stock market [news](https://imgur.com/EcqHtMU), it seems that most of the RBNHD retail investors that have jumped ship are going to Square’s Cash APP with almost 40% of investors choosing the app. We have to see if this trend continues now, after [RBNHD](https://imgur.com/joQIln0) removed limits on all stocks, but regardless, I think Square is a nice FinTech play despite their huge valuation right now, as they will also benefit from the jump in digital currencies and more companies planning to increase investments in integrated POS providers just like Square 🚀

We also had a lot of interesting earnings last week with Amazon [crushing](https://imgur.com/GILwN3r) expectations, beating by almost $7 and almost $6B on revenues as this was the first time Amazon passed the $100B mark in a quarter as the holiday & e-commerce demand combined to give Amazon a 44% increase y/y in sales. The other big [thing](https://imgur.com/WMmAddL) we got from Amazon was that Bezos will step down as CEO as Andy Jassy the current AWS leader will become the next CEO. This news caused some uncertainty for the company, but I believe this is still a long-term buying opportunity as Amazon will remain one of the best companies to own in the world 🚀

Also, one of the biggest fintech companies out there, [PayPal](https://imgur.com/Klv5tD6) showed great strength in their numbers, beating both the top & bottom line as their total payment volume and new active accounts showed continued strength in the move to more & more online payments solutions 🚀

The other big earnings report we saw last week was from [Alphabet](https://imgur.com/5BOUPT0), which also beat by more than $6 and $4B in revenues as they surprised most of the analysts with great beats in most of the segments as their operating margin came in 5% better than expected. The biggest income generator remained the Search & YouTube business as they are still investing huge in their Cloud platform that is still bleeding money, but is very likely to pay out in the long-run 🚀

Other companies also smashed earnings with [Pinterest](https://imgur.com/0zB9SPh) beating expectations after a 76% revenue growth and a 37% user growth while [Ford](https://imgur.com/zerclC2), which was expected to post a loss, turned out positive earnings of $0.43 despite a 9% decrease y/y in total revenues, as the last 2 quarters of the year provided strong evidence that Ford is progressing into turning around the company🚀🚀

Meanwhile, though they didn’t have an earnings report, [COSTCO](https://imgur.com/6UmGJ7x) reported a rise in sales of almost 18% in January as the total comparable same store sales which rose by 15.9% crushed the analyst expectations of just 11.7%. I believe Costco is one of the best retailers to own despite it trading always at a premium, as the company is also jumping on the e-commerce trend, with a 107% increase in e-commerce sales in January🚀

And finally, let’s hope for a good day as the [world](https://imgur.com/itl9KxB) stock markets and the US [Futures](https://imgur.com/mlrfLz5) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way after the Treasury Secretary [pushed](https://imgur.com/jfKvaev) for more fiscal aid to help the economy & the unemployment fully recover as fast as possible.

2021-02-11 08:44:24,BB/AMZN Speculation: Blackberry IVY for the automotive industry is just a cover. We are thinking too small.,"175 million cars currently runs on BlackBerry QNX blah blah yada yada we’ve all read a hundred DDs on why BB is going to dominate the EV software market and IVY is gonna collect harvest boatloads of data which BB can sell for a pretty penny. 

But think about it. 

Like, wrinkly-brain think about it.

Amazon doesn’t build cars or sell car insurance so what the hell do they really want out of this Blackberry partnership?

The answer is drones. Lots of drones. Our cities will be swarming with delivery drones in the near future, and Amazon needs a way to:

1. Control a vast network of drones that can delivery 2+ billion parcels per year 

2. Prevent them from running into other drones/evtols/planes/vehicles 

3. Prevent them from being hijacked by hackers and demonstrate to the government that their millions of drones are safe and secure (Blackberry has highest security rating)

4. Collect live data from the drones for package tracking, delivery times estimation , route optimization etc (IVY)

Andy Jassy, the current CEO of Amazon Web Services, will be taking over as CEO of Amazon in Q3. The same Andy Jassy from this article about BlackBerry IVY:

“AWS and BlackBerry are making it possible for any automaker to continuously reinvent the customer experience and transform vehicles from fixed pieces of technology into systems that can grow and adapt with a user’s needs and preferences,” said Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services, Inc. “Through this joint effort with BlackBerry, we will provide automakers with the insights, capabilities, agility, and speed they need to thrive in an increasingly connected world. As automakers seek to race ahead in their digital transformations, BlackBerry IVY empowers them to build their brands and set the standard for connected vehicle services across the automotive industry.”

Blackberry IVY isn’t just some pet project for Amazon’s incoming CEO. It is quite possibly their MOST important project. Drone Delivery means that your Amazon Orders can get to you in MINUTES rather than days, and that they can come to YOU based on your GPS location instead of just your home or work address. 

Amazon’s plans for drone delivery is no secret, but always seemed like a far-flung future kinda thing. Until now. 

There must be a reason why Jassy of all people was chosen to take the helm at Amazon. What can he bring to Amazon that he isn’t already bringing from his current position as head of AWS?

TLDR: Drones and Amazon’s domination of urban airspace

Positions: jacked to the tits on BB shares. (Calls are too expensive due to meme status.)",1076,0.96
2021-03-04 19:44:51,BB/AMZN Speculation Part 3: Drones confirmed,"In case you missed it, here are [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhooz1/bbamzn_speculation_blackberry_ivy_for_the/) and [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/li6gf1/bbamzn_speculation_part_2_forget_cars_its_was_all/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) of my speculation that Amazon's partnership with BB extends well beyond simply developing IVY to sell to automakers. I believe they are working together on Amazon's long overdue Prime Air fleet which will give BB access to autonomous flight data from hundreds of thousands of drones. This will put them years ahead of any evtol manufacturer or rtos developer and secure a monopoly in endpoint management for virtually anything on the IOT and is capable of moving vertically.

Today, BlackBerry was featured at Morgan Stanley Technology's media conference. Charles Eagan (BB's Chief Tech Officer) answered a bunch of questions about security, IVY, QNX, end-point management etc. [Link to Webcast](https://morganstanley.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1430549&tp_key=381e2505f3). (Drones mentioned at 18 minutes)

When asked about drones, Charles said: ""we are not allowed to talk about which vendors are using which tech,"" and ""there is a number of active drone engagement that are happening""

This practically confirms my theory that 1) IVY is being developed for not just ground based vehicles but flying ones as well and 2) they are working on it with some degree of secrecy.

Amazon's drone fleet running on IVY will a great catalyst for BB share price... and that announcement can come at anytime. There is also some speculation going on about potential acquisition of BB, which isn't that far-fetched considering how John Chen joined Sybase in 1998, reinvented the company, and sold it to SAP a decade later.

2021-02-11 23:48:45,BB/AMZN Speculation Part 2: Forget cars. It's was all about the drones from the start.,"In case you missed it: [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhooz1/bbamzn_speculation_blackberry_ivy_for_the/) of my speculation on why I think BB/AMZN are not-so-secretly working together on drones. 

TLDR: AWS's CEO will become Amazon's CEO, and together with JC he will make Futurama-esque air traffic a reality in the near future via AWS IOT and QNX/IVY.

Okay first things first. To dispel the notion that ""bLacKbErRy QnX iS foR caRS And iT haS notHinG to Do wITH DronES"" see: [https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/autonomous-systems/](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/autonomous-systems/) Literally the very first image on that page is a drone. QNX isn't just for cars. It's for all things autonomous including cars, trucks, evtols, drones, minority report spider bots, you name it.

Secondly, with regards to those who claim that ""Amazon can just program their own drones"" and thus has no need for BlackBerry, I implore you to check out BB's trove of Government certifications (link [https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/certifications](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/certifications)) and 40000+ patents (link [https://www.greyb.com/blackberry-patents-infringement-potential/](https://www.greyb.com/blackberry-patents-infringement-potential/)). 

With that out of the way, let's talk D-R-O-N-E-S

Here are a few more supporting evidence for my hypothesis:

December 2013 - Bezos reveals Amazon Prime Air, a R&D project to deliver parcels with ""octocopters"" He suggested it would be \~5 years or so before it is available to consumers. [LINK](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-unveils-futuristic-plan-delivery-by-drone/) Well, it's been 7 years now so we are already 2+ years behind schedule.

December 18, 2015 - Amazon file for patents pertaining to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (LINK at bottom)

December 18, 2015 - AWS IOT (Internet of Things) launches [LINK](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-iot-now-generally-available/)

>""We built IoT Core because connected devices are proliferating. They are in your house, your car, your office, your school, and perhaps even in your body! Like some of our more advanced customers, we have been building systems around connected devices for quite some time. **Our experience with** [**Amazon Robotics**](https://www.amazonrobotics.com/#/)**, drones (**[**Amazon Prime Air**](http://www.amazon.com/b?node=8037720011)**)**, the [Amazon Echo](http://www.amazon.com/echo), the [Dash Button](http://www.amazon.com/oc/dash-button), and multiple generations of [Kindles](http://www.amazon.com/Kindle) has given us a well-informed perspective on how to serve this really important emerging market""

Is it reaching to suggest that Amazon very much had DRONES on their minds when they started AWS IOT on the same day the filed for UAV patents? Take a look at this [picture](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-MY-sGfWtWNrFljWJj01HIzWM34=/0x0:811x612/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:811x612):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8738261/drone_interior.png) to get an idea of what Amazon had in mind.

Fast forward to 2020

In Jan 2020, AWS announced a collaboration with BlackBerry:

>""The platform will integrate the BlackBerry QNX operating system and over-the-air software update services, with **AWS IoT** cloud services for secure connectivity and telematics, Amazon SageMaker for developing ML models, and **AWS IoT** edge services for in-vehicle ML inference.""

Alright, so the purpose of this partnership is ""secure connectivity"", ""telematics (monitoring of vehicle)"" and ""ML (machine learning)"".. nothing that specifically points to drones yet

In June 2020, BlackBerry partners with DeDrone (a leader in airspace security):

>""New advanced technologies have the potential to solve some of today’s most pressing challenges, however, they also introduce new security risks,” said Christoph Erdmann, Senior Vice President of Secure Communications, BlackBerry. “**Drones are one of the many IoT endpoints that add to the growing chaos that security leaders must navigate.** We’re excited to partner with Dedrone to offer a critical solution that organizations around the world can use to keep citizens and the public safe.”

Drones. Security. IoT. 5 months after Amazon and BlackBerry began their collaboration.

In September 2020, Amazon Drone Fleet receives FAA approval. Did BB have anything to do with it? Maybe, maybe not.

Alright, so let's pretend that you subscribe to this hypothesis that BB had a hand in Amazon's drone project. So what? BFD, right? How many drones are we even talking about? 20000? 50000?

Amazon delivers \~3 billion packages a year globally. Drones are by far the cheapest option for last mile delivery (contrast that with a dude wear khaki shorts driving a 2 ton truck from the Amazon fulfillment center to your condo) so it's no stretch to suggest that it will be Amazon's preferred method of delivery like 99%+ of the time. No, a drone isn't going to fly all the way from Seattle, Washington to your porch in Blaine.. but an autonomous truck might take your parcel from Seattle to Blaine and let a drone complete the rest of the journey. Or something. 

3 billion deliveries divided by 365  = 8.219 million deliveries per day. Even if drones can deliver packages to you in 30 minutes on average (60 min round trip) and worked around the clock with no need for recharging or maintenance, it would take 342465 drones. That's 342465 unmanned flying vehicles collecting flight data for IVY. 

I'm gonna stop myself here before this completely devolves into JC/Jassy fan fiction. The whole point of this coke bender DD is to suggest that BB's potential isn't merely ""OS for Cars."" In fact, cars only account for 175 million out of Blackberry's 500 million IOT endpoints. 

We're talking about drones, flying taxis, robots, roombas, fighter jets, tanks, and yes, EVs too. Essentially, anything that MOVES and CAN POTENTIALLY BE HACKED = $$$ for BB. I wager that there will be plenty of things in the future which fall into both of those categories.

Position: a modest amount of BB shares.

Long story short, AMZN is about to pop. they have earnings coming in late January and we all know they KILLED IT! From previous years, they have been dominating the Black Friday and Ciber Mondays sales, so it is not surprising they did it again with all these covid restrictions.

2021-01-11 07:14:00,AMZN 3333% Earnings YOLO with less than $1000! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀💰💰,"Listen up slow pokes I’m using emojis so you understand:

🐂 + 💵 + 🚀 = 💰💰💰

Disclaimer: this is my first post but I take losses every week so Ik what I’m doing. 

For the more competent folks here, Amazon is the most anticipated earnings coming up. This stock has been a sleeper since it ran up crazy this summer. They don’t want you to pay attention to it. But there’s a lot of reasons to give it a yolo option play for big tendies.

DD: 
- Amazon makes money, lot of money.
- Holiday numbers
- waiting for technical breakout above $3500 
- potential split for Bezos ego to reclaim #1 wealthiest 
- where’s the downside fr unless the market tanks
 
If there’s any received positive news and we have a decent earnings season amzn will move 10% to break $3500. 

If a split is announced I’m expecting a 30% run at least, could skyrocket to 50%+ so be aware. Apple ran up 30% and Tesla ran up 70%.

Some affirmation for this play is watching other earnings reactions on good news, Bezos does not disappoint. 

Imma be honest this is more of a yolo but just hear me out. 

The main play here: 
- DEBIT SPREADS WITH TIME 
 
I’m going for doubles, ones much closer to the money around February then looking at the $4000’s+. 

My position:
Double Debit Spread for Feb 19
- $3190/$3200 
- $4000/$4300
Cost: $900

The main goal is that total cost is less than the closer atm spread. This security allows for the spread to be paid for with a measly 1% move but if there’s a split max return:

$30,000!!! For $9.00

Some considerations for the week are the market sentiment and Biden economic plan. 

For the og wsb purist types just buy the $4000’s for $10.00 for so

POSITION UPDATES: 

- Earnings are February 4th, March may provide less iv crush but will be harder to exit
- if you don’t know what a spread is just buy March $5000c for $400 or so could pay (this is a yolo and if no split abort) 
-average Amazon Bull run is 26% over 18 days I’m still holding Feb 19ths but may pick up a March $4500c closer to earnings

Had a near $2,000 bull run from March 2020 at a price of $1,600 to $3,550 in September. Huge symmetrical triangle on the weekly chart signaling another move of the same kind.

If we can get a similar move, that'd put Amazon over $5,000 by around August. I'm INSANELY bullish on AMZN. I'm currently swinging options expiring in 2 weeks, but I'd like to sell to buy an expiration much further out. Bought yesterday on the dip to $3,140. In addition, I'm hearing rumors of a potential stock split in the coming months. Literally ALL rumors tho so I'm not counting on it, but imagine the impact it'd have. As we've seen with Apple and Tesla, it will make Amazon go crazy

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now Corona hit us and we all know people spend a lot more time online shopping then usual! Appstore sales (Apple) were off the roof and Amazon will have the same for sure.

|Q2|5.22|10.3|97.32%|
|Q1|7.09|5.01|\-29.34%|

Now in Q1 2020 Amazon invested a lot in safety for their emploees and in last mile delivery. As you can see these investements made huge gains YoY and I wouldnt be surprised if the make more than 200% YoY in Q4! Chrismas was stay at home and let it deliver. 600$ Stimulus went straight in Amazon.

&#x200B;

The EPS estimate for Q4 2020 is 6.97. If we take the 6.47 (Q4 2019 and apply the growth we guess you can see the real estimate here:

&#x200B;

|0%|50%|100%|200%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|6.47|9.70|12.94|19.41|

So if the only grow about 20% they will have the estimate. Would you guess they grow earnings for 20% YoY? I would make a wild guess for 150-200%

If that is true we could see an epic 10-15% move of the stock after earnings. Q4 2019 disrupted the stock and pushed it 8% higher and the surprice was only 60%. If you take the 200% Growth YoY Q4 it would surprise by 300% which could lead to absolute new ATHs.

My estimate: 150% YoY Q4, which bringt earnings to **16,175 EPS and a surprise of 232%**(!!!!)

2020-12-06 18:55:08,ATSG - a sneaky play on AMZN,"ATSG - Air Transport Supply Group.  An under the radar play on Amazon and likely an acquisition target. Stick with me here:

ATSG subsidiary Air Transport International will fly the six Boeing 767 converted freighters under a preexisting contract with Amazon to provide crew, maintenance and insurance. Amazon is leasing the planes for 10 years from another ATSG company, Cargo Aircraft Management (CAM), part of a deal this summer for 12 aircraft. 

The first leased freighter began operating under the Amazon banner in May, with the remainder scheduled to start work next year.

With the new flight award, ATSG projects that its airlines will operate 38 767s for Amazon Air by April 2021, 36 of which CAM leases to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).

In exchange for the commitment for 12 more leases, Amazon will receive 7 million warrants to purchase ATSG stock, increasing its potential ownership stake to 38%. If Amazon leases five more aircraft under the 2018 deal, its equity stake in ATSG could reach 40% — double the investment rights granted in the initial 2016 partnership. So far, Amazon has not exercised any of the warrants granted by Wilmington, Ohio-based ATSG.

I believe this is a strategic acquisition target for AMZN, as they have made a strong push into their own delivery and owning the process end to end. From delivery to the distribution centers to delivery to the customer. 

https://cheddar.com/media/amazon-replacing-usps-with-own-delivery-network

Based on their growth with ATSG and their potential 40% ownership stake - it is a logical progression and one I’m betting on.

ATSG is a leading provider of aircraft leasing and air cargo transportation and related services to domestic and foreign air carriers and other companies that outsource their air cargo lift requirements. ATSG, through its leasing and airline subsidiaries, is the world's largest owner and operator of converted Boeing 767 freighter aircraft. Through its principal subsidiaries, including three airlines with separate and distinct U.S. FAA Part 121 Air Carrier certificates, ATSG provides aircraft leasing, air cargo lift, passenger ACMI and charter services, aircraft maintenance services and airport ground services. ATSG's subsidiaries include ABX Air, Inc.; Airborne Global Solutions, Inc.; Airborne Maintenance and Engineering Services, Inc., including its subsidiary, Pemco World Air Services, Inc.; Air Transport International, Inc.; Cargo Aircraft Management, Inc.; and Omni Air International, LLC.

Basically everyone thought Africa was dead money and JMIA was doomed because of shitty infrastructure and logistics. So JMIA said fuck it we gotta do it ourselves then, and...they did. Now they're opening it up to third party sellers. They literally just went out and did it and are now letting everyone else use it.

**""It's a move that sees Jumia instantly become one of the biggest players in e-commerce logistics space across the continent.""**

**""But Jumia's obvious gain's aside, the move is also potentially crucial for the wider e-commerce sector given how much of an albatross efficient logistics has been for businesses looking to widen their scope through online commerce and delivery.""**

&#x200B;

they literally built it, have been testing it, and are rolling it out. they're even offering first 10 free deliveries to entice businesses to give it a shot and see for themselves.

&#x200B;

Not to mention their payments arm, Jumia Pay, just saw their payments volume double YoY to $63mm and 2.4 million transactions -- **which has not yet been monetized**.

&#x200B;

Ask 10 of your trader/investor dipshit friends if they know any of this about JMIA. their uninformed responses are representative of what the market and the idiot shorts who are gonna get toasted believe, and this is why they are wrong.

EDIT: watch their next 4 quarters closely for growth in this new logistics space they've carved out. if it proves painless and effective, bulls get rewarded handsomely. and the next domino right behind it is Jumia Pay

2021-01-15 14:56:08,Google Trends Analysis of Amzn searches. For those playing upcoming earnings.,"&#x200B;

I've compiled google trends comparing Amazon searches over the last 3 years. Then, I correlated that information with Earning Reports. Keep in mind this doesn't take into account people using the app store. 

TL;DR. I've deduced that Q2's huge boost from earnings could have been easily been spotted using Google Trends. Also, I've found the overall interest in searches during Q4 this year is better than 2019 Q4 Google trends, in which the underlying had an 8% pop from Q4 ER. Keep in mind Consensus Estimate is almost double that of 2019 Q4 ER. 

&#x200B;

To help you make sense of the Google Trends graphs I've posted, I'm also including a chart that fellow Amazontard u/slocs1 used in his EPS post. 

&#x200B;

TABLE 1

https://preview.redd.it/9i90ampipkb61.png?width=1472&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fa531224626dabfcf0a80ff6606aedc695099b8

TABLE 2 shows trending results for Q2 Amazon google trends. The last big ride for Amazon was for q2 (april-june 2020). Google trends justified Q2's pop as average google interest was well over 80 and mostly in the 90s.

&#x200B;

TABLE 2 

[2020 Q2 amazon google trends ](https://preview.redd.it/r2s8ec4vekb61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=59380e74bc0f0bca95f145e015aceb575317dc83)

&#x200B;

Q4 2019 ER had an 8% pop day of earnings release. Mostly in 50s and 60s interest, plus holiday pop, then averaged out at 75 interest. Trends showed in TABLE 3:

TABLE 3

[2019 Q4 amazon google trends ](https://preview.redd.it/ywz1etq9fkb61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0805354ecd48509438c5ff78d272c0a20e6760b)

2020 Q4  shows very similar interest patterns to previous years. The dip in interest is from the election, not sure what that mid October pop in interest was. The general interest is higher than 2019.

&#x200B;

TABLE 4

[2020 Q4 amazon google trends](https://preview.redd.it/bv6kuc6hjkb61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=23f61372729937b710a393e282430613d2627ed7)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TABLE 5 shows entire 2019-2020 google trends. Again that Q2 growth in interest (may) directly correlates to stock's growth during Q2 Earnings Release. The holiday season interest was stretched out this year, and shows it was 10 days longer than 2019 Q4, which is promising. 

&#x200B;

TABLE 5

[2019-2020 Amazon google trends](https://preview.redd.it/3b56dq10kkb61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=efc1925f3c7310f3b63dc859814e17b287312235)

And here is 5 year google trends. Clearly, massive growth in Q2 this year, but radically declined to the yearly mean for Q3, which is possibly why Q3 ER dropped the underlying stock price, as interest stagnated, although it was still above the previous years interest. 

&#x200B;

TABLE 6

[5 Year Amazon google trends](https://preview.redd.it/r5hjpvq4nkb61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=623a3375c36d2baec87a5f66b71679134a49d42d)

&#x200B;

Although Google Trends isn't taking into account all of the industries AMZN is dipping it's pen into (i.e. AWS). I do think it's compelling all the same. I will say that I wish I saw more of a drastic change in Q4 google trends to be more confident my calls will print. Please, give me feedback and advice as my calls are bleeding rocket fuel :)

Most recently, WMT started revamping **200 Supercenter stores** this fiscal year and plans to revamp another **1,000 stores** next year. The most notable changes in store will be directed specifically for online pickup orders. This ***does not*** take into account the vast amount of **WMT fulfillment warehouses** currently under construction that will deliver.

What gives WMT an advantage over AMZN is that they already have the space and can easily streamline the remodel by just applying for the permits for a in store remodel. 

Unlike AMZN, who would need to keep acquiring new locations, pull permits, wait for approvals and then get started on construction.

Real Estate consultancy firm JLL said that the need for fulfillment centers, which house eCommerce, is driving 50 percent of today's industrial transactions, compared to 35 percent before COVID-19. The **U.S. will need one BILLION additional square feet of warehouse space** by 2025 due to the fast growth of eCommerce.

I'm not going to make this longer than it already is and this is more of a location and growth DD so I'm not going to go into company financials.

2020-08-27 09:49:20,Bezos will split AMZN at least 5-for-1. Here's the DD.,"Being a poorfag wanting to buy some AMZN $4000 10/16, I was saddened by both the need to plop $3000 per contract, and get reamed by the $1.50 in bid/ask spread. 

So looking for DD starting from my favorite site, Google Images, I noticed many signs that confirms a split will be coming, with the number 5 being the most likely. 

1. Bezos has already showed his affinity for a split, most famously from his wife, the ultimate girl-chad who if Elon wasn't already in a relationship, would definitely try to get his FUNDING SECURED from. 

&#x200B;

[At least 2 for 1 split](https://preview.redd.it/zpri3bswpkj51.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=523a6fb45f443862e39d7ac610c2a016b9b786f9)

2. Like how his Highness [tweeted on 5/1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ibfipq/musk_is_genius/), covertly giving everyone the signal that TSLA will be split 5 for 1, Bezos has been giving the signal throughout the years.

&#x200B;

3. Even at a 5 for 1 split, AMZN would be at around $600, far beyond the reach of the average autismo or retard. But good news, I also found this super secret image, where Bezos is flashing the ""Double BULLGANG symbol"", indicating a possible 10 for 1 split.

in 2017, amc stock was around $30. now the stock is less than $3. big rona is raging hard in people's hearts and ballots, and meanwhile america's biggest corporations are getting a raging hard-on for buying a chain of movie theaters.

bloomberg reported last night ""rumors"" that AMC is going to go bankrupt. True, they are running out of cash--which they had reserves for through the end of this year.

but where are suburban 14 year olds supposed to do with their time? where else they gonna try and hold a girl's hand, and get rejected? the movies, retard. they aren't going away, no matter how ""sick"" your home theater system is. you live in a studio apartment anyways, dumbass.

and honestly, movie theaters are simple enough to retrofit, you just install some new HVAC filters or whatever donald glover's air conditioning character tells you to do. unlike cruise ships or airplanes.

CEO Adam Aron then said on bloomberg following the rumors, last night: 

> ""the company isn't considering bankruptcy, and is instead looking at ways in which it might raise cash to ride out the pandemic. Bankruptcy, Aron says, might have to be an option down the road, ""but that time has not yet arrived, and any reports to the contrary are wholly inaccurate.""

AMC is definitely looking for a buyer. It's allowed now, thanks to a court ruling this last summer, i think.

Lookin at you Bezos, and maybe you, netflix guy. also, have you seen the AMZN Studios intro on prime? they show AMZN branded movie theaters, if that's the kinda dd you like. prime early access for showings? yes.

besides, rona gonna be background noise by next summer's blockbusters. they might even replay the blockbusters that got blueballed this year (tenet, 007, mulan).

AMZN crushed it when everything was locked down.  And then raised guidance for this quarter.   It'll do well if we lock down again, or if we don't.  Hard to have a more fundamental, blue-chip like stock that's a fiery growth tech stock.  That is a rare, rare combo.  This is not some dumb RH gamble.  If they get broken up at some point and have to spin off Amazon Web services, so what?  They'll do well as a single unit, or as 2 separate companies.  When, what most likely will be massive inflation appears...they'll do well.

2021-03-07 07:20:20,GME SQUEZZE DD MOON SOON (possibly),"Good morning, good afternoon and good evening my fellow retards around the world.

I know many of you are more like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k77i69/wsb_reading_citron_reports/) if it comes to reading DDs. But I wanted to explain a few things with the ultimate aim, that you dont need to do read any more DD but rather can do your own DD. As most of you cant read anyways, Ill put a TLDR with symbols at the bottom. So here we go.

# General squezze theory (I know a lot of words but reading will make you a big brain 🦍)

There are two types of squezzes:

* short squezze
* gamma squezze

**Short squezzes:**

Evil Hedgefunds and MMs sell a stock, which they dont have, in hope they can buy it back cheaper. Now price goes up --> Hedgefunds have to cover to cut their losses. Otherwise there is the risk of unlimited loss, as stock price can go up infinitely. If they wait to long they get margin called, because their broker is in fear that they cant cover anymore. And no one wants to get [margin called](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9v5e9/that_margin_call_notification_at_3am/).

**Gamma squezzes:**

Evil MMs (and others) sell far OTM call options. Now price goes up and suddenly those options are ITM. MMs now have to buy the stock to cover their sold options making the price surge once again bringing new formely OTM options ITM, which then again leads to the price surging. This feedback loop is called a gamma squezze. For this to happen you need to have high numbers of OTM option sold at certain strike prices. Just enough, that the next strike price is reached. It is more likely that lower strike prices are reached. MMs know that, hence they have already hedged some of there sold OTM options with these lower strike prices. This is called Delta Hedging. That means you need higher number of OTM options with lower strike prices then of those with higher strike prices to keep the Squezze going.

If you want to go even deeper I suggest you look at u/Natural_Profession_8 [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz8mgr/a_deepdive_on_the_actual_math_behind_gamma/). He also did a formula, which you can use to calculate how to have the biggest leverage with option buying, meaning forcing MMs to buy the most shares with the purchase of option with a certain strike price.

What you always need to keep in mind for both kinds of squezze that the price run up to trigger the squezze has to be rather fast. Otherwise, there is more time to cover shorts or hedge options and hence having less effect on the price.

# Applying this to the current GME situation

**Short squezze:**

Im sorry to say that, but I dont think a squezze solely because of shorts covering will be happening any time soon. You have all seen how the short interest has dropped tremendously from the previous legendary 226%^(1) within the last to reporting dates to now 60%^(2).

^(1: 01/14/21,) [^(Yahoo Finance)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) ^(with Morningstar data, which suggests a Float of roughly 27M shares)

^(2: 02/11/21,) [^(Yahoo Finance)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) ^(with Morningstar data, which suggests a Float of roughly 27M shares)

*""But there was no volume?"".* Just look at the numbers. GME had a average Volume of 40.49M per day over the last three months. As a stock with roughly 70M shares outstanding thats a lot.^(3) AMZN had a 3 months average volume of 3.73M per day with roughly 7x the shares outstanding of GME.^(4) There was enough volume.

^(3:)  [^(Yahoo Finance)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)

^(4:)  [^(Yahoo Finance)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/key-statistics?p=AMZN)

*""But what is with the institutional ownership?""* You all probably all seen these posts, where its said ""Institutions solely hold xTimes Outstanding shares of GME. So there has to be massive short interest."" (e. g. see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz77ix/gme_total_shares_owned_is_145m_according_to_finra/)). But what most of these Posts are missing, that there often reporting delays in between ownership filing, which is causing these high numbers. If you compare it again to AMZN, you also have institutions owning 1.5x of shares outstanding. With a company called Russell Investments Group, LLC owning over 80% of AMZN shares.^(5) That should show you, that these FINRA numbers arent correct all the time. Especially with high volumes like in GME, there are a lot of Duplicates because of reporting delays.

^(5:) [^(Finra)](https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P000000B7)^(, Tab: Shareholders)

With that being said, the amount of GME shares hold by Institutions still seems suspiciously high to me. And there are other things like the reported 111% Short interest in XRT^(6) or the still abnormally high Short interest in GME. That means remaining shorts could still be a nice catalyst for a possible gamma squezze.

**Gamma squezze:**

A gamma squezze, often underestimated compared to his brother the short squezze. But I think this was the main reason for the surge in January and the surge last week. Especially last week was probably a well set up and executed option chain by big whales.

*So how can 🦍🦍🦍 profit from a gamma squezze?* Just take a look at the current option chains. u/indonesian_activist did a great [excel sheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxkeg0/repost_gme_squeeze_calculator/), where you can see how many shares MMs have to buy if GME reaches a certain price. Just type in the current price and the projected price.

^(Note: I did update his excel sheet with the new data, which you can find) [^(here)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZYGIff3Iq7UNyo88SVevj32rcYs0oqlS/view?usp=sharing)^(. Also I added, an option on the cover, so that you can decide which Option expiring dates you want to include.)

*But how many shares are enough to cause a gamma squeeze?* This is really hard to say, but according to u/CoastalHotDog835 [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lycj6f/gme_dd_part_2_taking_a_look_at_the_0603_calls/). Last weeks surge had the following option volumes:

>*1.86M shares at $55 = $102.3Million*  
>  
>*2.90M shares at $120 = $348Million*

So these are probably numbers we need to see again.

^(Note: These are just two Strike prices. I can not say how much other options with other strike prices e. g. 100$ played a role nor do I know how high their volume was. Unluckily most sites dont have data for the past.)

*So whats the current situation with GME options?*

For the options expiring the coming week, we need to have at least a doubling of the price to see the same amount of shares having to be bought by MMs compared with last weeks 55$ calls.

^(Note: It is not fully sufficient compare these two numbers. On the one hand in the excel there are shares already hedged deducted, which decreases the numbers of shares. On the other hand there are not only options included with the projected strike price but all options. I hope, in the absense of better numbers for the option volumes of last week as already stated above, that these two effects could equalize each other.)

&#x200B;

[Shares need to be bought by MMs if GME hits 300$ for options expiring 03\/12](https://preview.redd.it/jm8qjkjveml61.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=541ebeaac563fad9fa536ba770d98f0566acc967)

But for the week after that it looks a lot better. Only a price of 190$ would be needed to see the same amount of shares having to be bought by MMs compared with last weeks 55$ calls. This is only a value increase of roughly 40%, which is very well possible. Especially if we really have some big whales on our side like, what is seeming to be the case.

&#x200B;

I may be adding some more analysis thoughts later. But I will wait with that until I know people are actually reading this.

And of course no financial advice!

EDIT: Someone in the comments has pointed out that I actually misspelled Squeeze. Sorry for that. So you see Im also just an 🦍, who cant write.

2021-02-14 06:19:23,Why I think AMD is going up a lot soon,"Corona\`s main economic impact is supply chain disruptions that are unprecedented. Before Covid supply chain was running smooth as a glove, think of it as a highway full of cars flowing at exact same speed and spaced equally. This supply chain was being perfected for over a decade. And then this shitstorm happened. The highway is clogged, ships are standing loaded with crap they cannot effectively unload quick enough, there aren\`t enough ships to move products that are needed. Including basic materials for industries and intermediate components to make a final product.

For those who don\`t know, there is an absolute chip shortage in the market right now. Spanning from AMD/NVDA CPUs and GPUs, to auto chips, to new consoles, and any kind of electronics. Even AAPL will have sales issues this quarter caused by the chip shortage.

The main chip producer TSMC is ramping up CAPEX to $28 billion, including $12 bn for their US plant.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/tsmc-profit-beats-expectations-as-chipmaker-widens-tech-lead](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/tsmc-profit-beats-expectations-as-chipmaker-widens-tech-lead) 

The perfect storm is brewing for NVDA and AMD to gain enormously from this market, but in my opinion AMD will end up with upper hand, let me explain.

&#x200B;

1. Back in 2017/2018 year old GPUs were selling over on Amazon and elsewhere for double their MSRP. These were old graphic cards! their price should have depreciated over time, but didn\`t. Why? Cause of B T C. Miners were buying that shit by bulks. Guess what? We\`re at the exact same situation right now, except that price of that thingy is now $50k! and with new cards being more cost effective you wouldn\`t be able to buy ANY right now even if you wanted it to simply upgrade your PC and play something. As a matter of fact try to buy GTX 10xx or RTX 20xx gen on Amazon, there are NONE! So its not only the latest gen that\`s unavailable, its ALL of them. And CPUs have the exact same problem, which wasn\`t so bad in 2018. And soon you might find it impossible to buy even any laptop having latest chip: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156)
2. Not long ago NVDA announced $40 bn acquisition of ARM which would ensure they have access to state of the art IP which would make them future chip behemoth, and not surprisingly the largest companies in the world are now lobbying against that [https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns) . With this in mind, its becoming increasingly likely the acquisition wont go through. On the other hand, AMD replied with the acquisition of XLNX which seems wouldn\`t be such an issue considering AMD is way smaller than NVDA or INTC.
3. AMD and QCOM are actively lobbying US gov to address the issue, which they will. What to expect? Quite likely to remove previous trade policies regarding chips - resulting in easier access and higher/cheaper volume of chips being produced overseas. Which would mean AMD can ramp up production and meet the huge current demand of data centers and whoever needs their GPU. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage) . 
4. Price action - stocks follow certain pattern. They kinda wobble within some range for long period of time, 6-18 months, this is where a lot of accumulation by big players happen, and fundamentals kind of crystalize. Once the conditions are right, the stock can shoot 50% in a span of a month and then hover on new level for considerable time. Look at the chart of TSLA 2015-2019, NVDA numerous times, AMZN, GOOG, etc. Right now, NVDA is up already 20% in the last month. I believe the market will look from NVDA to AMD very soon, given points 2-3 and major holders wont be willing to sell for current price.

To recap what is the perfect storm. In 2017/18 chip shortage was caused mainly by A. the thing we dont mention here, right now its also B. new consoles cant be produced fast enough, C. supply chain issues which might be resolved soon, C. simply way bigger improvement in new CPUs/GPUs hence new upgrade cycle coupled with corporate upgrade cycle due to COVID

2020-07-21 05:22:48,Too poor to enjoy AMZN quarantine tendies but still hungry? UPS will deliver,"  

UPS has earnings on 7/30 and it should be a good tendie-ing opportunity. Obviously there has been an uptick in the parcel delivery service based on the increase in online shopping due to COVID-19. FedEx, the other big parcel delivery company, had earnings on 6/30 where they reported EPS of $2.53 vs. consensus estimate of $1.42. Revenue was down YoY by 2.5%. This caused share price to jump 12% (140 -> 158) overnight:

[FDX Jump](https://preview.redd.it/39cn8pp0c7c51.jpg?width=1913&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4fb85bcffab89ab3e3ec319e3fe476cdba6a4a82)

At the same time UPS jumped up and has been hovering around the same:

FedEx has a much lower contribution margin per package delivered as they are trying to cut prices to compete against UPS, which is approx. 3x larger anyway.  Anecdotally, I watch the UPS truck pull up to my apartment building and stay for around 30-45mins every day delivering packages, while I see the FedEx truck come maybe 2x a day where the driver will deliver one or two package.  It is my belief the UPS, as the king of logistics, has a much more efficient delivery system which allows more packages to be delivered per trip and thus increases the contribution margin of each package delivered by reducing variable costs related to vehicles and wages.  This is why UPS is going to kill earnings even harder than that guy in the FedEx costume killed that judge.

I personally have 7/31 $125 and 8/7 $125c.

TLDR: Get free money because people are scared to go outside

Edit: Down a bit but I’m not too worried. I was doing a little reading and found that UPS used a fuel surcharge to cover that cost of their business right. But it’s set for a contract period, meaning that there is a lag between fuel prices actually changing and the fuel surcharge being adjusted. I’m thinking since fuel has been cheap across the board since Covid started they are probably making extra bank on their charge. Basically if they’re charging at or near pre covid fuel surcharge but paying nothing for gas should be extra profit",161,0.95

My biggest questions tomorrow:

1. How much money did Amazon invest. My feeling is Q1 numbers w/ new abrupt costs and massive short-term hiring massively ate into their margins. I don't think that's the case for Q2.
2. Did AWS retake the growth from Azures decline in Q2?

2021-02-03 04:15:09,GME brief recap. Why did you buy GME in the first place? Hope to see more DDs instead of cultposting. Love you guys 🚀,"TLDR: Brief recap - fundamentals are still fun, and may be getting better. Upgraded Ryan Chewy + Reggie Nintendo, MSFT deal with rev share, pc building kiosk 1.5 store, console cycle, e-commerce growth and pivot. Probably missed some. Now with free worldwide exposure.

I am not trying to gatekeep whatever you guys want to post, but remember the time when people actually called GME stores to ask about pc kiosk (with recordings even)? Those type of posts are probably more useful if we want GME to moon. I think we all prefer the confirmation bias from more detailed fundamental DDs like those than posts about people holding the line. Maybe it's just me, but I would prefer people from all over the world knowing about how GME is a value play than a short squeeze play. Anyway, here's a brief recap on the 'fundamentals' to hopefully bring more fundamental DDs back.

**Upgraded Ryan Chewy + Reggie Nintendo**

I think we know who Ryan is. In short, Ryan grew Chewy by like, a lot, using little capital. Now Chewy competes against AMZN, etc. I don't have pets since I can't even take care of myself so I have not used Chewy, but an edge Chewy has against AMZN is apparently their customer service. All these growing Chewy means Ryan is now more experienced and has more connections than his Chewy days aka upgraded Ryan with bigger rockets.

You know who else is all about the customers? Reggie Nintendo. If you tards don't want to read, there are videos out there about Reggie and how his customer-oriented approach is pretty critical to Nintendo's success in freedom land. 

Note: I have seen some people saying how they did not really like GME in the past. Maybe Ryan + Reggie can change that.

**Microsoft revenue sharing**

GME will share revenue from all digital content: DLC, full games, microtransactions, xbox game pass, etc. This applies to both new and pre-owned systems. If someone bought the xbox at Walmart and then sold it to GME, GME would get a share of revenue on that system once it is resold. That's a pretty big deal itself, but here's a bigger implication: This is an incentive for GME to push MSFT systems. Will Sony, etc have a similar agreement with GME to mitigate this preferential treatment for xbox?

**PC building kiosk**

Know microcenter? I don't, because there is not one store near me. But from other DDs, apparently to get high end pc stuffs you need to either buy them online or drive hours to a microcenter. With the spread of GME stores, it doesn't take much to see how much advantage they have. Older DDs have people literally asking GME employees about pc kiosk 1.5 store. Now imagine this:

\- All the used parts they could offer to people wanting to upgrade frequently

\- Ease of building a pc + all in one package. The thing about building a pc is you really need to make sure the parts are right for each other and right for you or risk getting ripped off. PC building kiosk means you don't have to know about ALL the specs to get a suitable pc. Combined with purchasing games, accessories, special deals for powerup members, collectibles, third party exclusives, etc all in one application or location for sYnErGy and you get 🚀. Why go elsewhere when you can have everything in one place? Best part is you don't even need to build it yourself. Someone else can eat that thermal paste for you. Worry about bending a CPU pin? Not really your problem at the pc kiosk.

\-  Want further synergy? Logistical advantage with having a store near you and knowing what's popular. With the right data, they may really cut down on the waiting times for a buyer on popular parts if not outright branded as 'never out of stock'.

**Conclusion**

GME's turnaround story has not changed. GME just got an added worldwide exposure. Is $500 a fair valuation based on fundamentals alone? Maybe not, but with the focus on digital growth, it wouldn't surprise me if GME gets a tech-like valuation. Like one of our favorite analysts once said, GME is a disruptive EV company after all. Anyway, I got lazy and left out lots of other good stuff. If you want more, just look into older DDs. The sources are in those, too.

Position GME @ $30+. Never sold. Also holding some CRSR.

2021-03-09 21:39:47,Why Gamestop is still undervalued today,"First we can take a quick walk through the history of how this all started, and explain how none of what's happening was ""our fault"". GameStop had, admittedly, followed a pretty outdated business model since the early 2010s. The gaming industry, like many others, was moving digital and Gamestop lagged far behind this trend.

Hedge funds, rightfully so to an extent, began shorting Gamestop in 2016. They began shorting it around $40 and rode the wave down. But they kept getting more and more greedy. Yadda yadda, sub-$4 and 140% short.

Deep Fucking Value, Michael J Burry and others saw how undervalued Gamestop was at $4, and they started buying and HODLing shares. Just how undervalued were they when people started catching on in 2019/2020? Well, at the end of 2019, Gamestop had about $1.6B in cash and about $800M in debt - or a net cash position of +$800M. The market cap of Gamestop was $276M when the share price was $4. Completely ignoring any future cash flows, you could purchase a share worth nearly $12 in cash for $4. *Hedge funds were still shorting the stock at this point.*

Skip forward, Ryan Cohen becomes the catalyst that Sparks the shitkeg of short squeeze that hedge funds created, and off we went. Ryan Cohen, and his team, are the key. And what this thesis relies on **is already happening.**

Ryan Cohen and his team have begun taking over the board in what seems to be an amicable fashion. At least in the sense that it is not a hostile takeover. They've already ousted their dead weight CFO and have put in motion the new company vision to be an e-commerce retailer first, physical location game distributor second. That seems like a difficult transition to make...

Except Gamestop already has an online presence, already does e-commerce, has over 56 million subscribers to their online membership and increased their e-commerce sales by nearly 400% YoY **BEFORE Ryan Cohen became involved.**

So what's so special about Ryan Cohen? Well.. let's chew on that question for a second. *He turned a pet good company into a $30billion+ e-commerce giant.* Which gets us into the fundamentals. How does the market typically value e-commerce businesses? Many of them don't actually make a profit every year. They're valued based on future growth potential, usually based on a multiple of sales. Because e-commerce doesn't come with the overhead of physical retailers, investors will tolerate negative earnings in order to invest in rapid sustained growth, counting on them eventually becoming profitable.

Let's start with Chewy. In 2020, they did $6.46B in revenue and -$174M in net income. They're trading at a market cap of almost $34B, which is just over five times their revenue. Seems fairly reasonable.

Let's check in on our favorite gaming destination. In 2020, they did $5.16B in revenue and -$275M in net income. Not far off from Chewy, especially when you consider how much of Gamestop was still brick and mortar during a pandemic (oh and Chewy being fully e-commerce during a pandemic). GameStop, even after today, is trading at a market cap of $17B, which is just over three times revenue.

So two e-commerce companies. One built by Ryan Cohen, and one currently being led by Ryan Cohen. Trading at very different multiples. If we applied Chewys multiple to Gamestop, we would get a market cap of about $26B or a share price of about $377. That's a fair market value shareprice. **$377**. That does not consider a gamma or short squeeze at all. That is simply an efficient market pricing it as it should be valued.

Let's check some other e-commerce companies to make sure we are being reasonable.

- EBAY trades at a multiple of 3.72 times revenue
- ETSY trades at a multiple of 15.11 times revenue
- PINS trades at a multiple of 23.20 times revenue
- AMZN trades at a multiple of 4.00 times revenue

There are clearly outliers, on the high side. Industry norms are typically 3-5x revenue for established businesses. When you anticipate strong near-term growth, as in the case of ETSY and PINS, you can see significantly higher multiples.

Using these valuations, we can confidently say that Gamestop is currently flirting with the low end of fair value, and has about 40% upside if we view them as an established business without extraordinary growth expectations. Except. We kind of do expect them to grow.

Have I mentioned that nobody is considering their access to the e-gaming industry? Becoming a sponsor, or even facilitator of e-sporting events. Leagues, championships, etc. E-sports is a global industry that currently sees about $1B in revenue annually. This is expected to grow exponentially over the next decade, with most projections putting growth at 50-60% within the next two years, and continuing beyond that. Gamestop already has a Gamestop Performance Center, which is essentially a venue used for hosting major e-sporting events, as well as a host for training facilities. They've already tapped the market before Ryan Cohen, and his team will be able to truly capitalize on the market.

Then we have live streaming, and potential acquisitions. At some point, it's likely that they will do an offering to raise capital. Spoiler, they don't currently need capital, but could deploy equity capital toward specific initiatives. Like purchasing an established platform to distribute electronic game downloads. Or purchase an established platform for live streaming. These initiatives don't have to be through acquisitions, but if they choose to, they will be able to afford to.

Oh yeah, PC gaming as well. It's been confirmed by several here and elsewhere that Gamestop is adding a feature to many of their stores. A ""Build-A-PC"" workstation. You can buy parts and build your PC in the store. The PC gaming industry is currently $38billion annually. It's expected to grow another 10% in the next few years. Another industry with rapid growth potential that Gamestop has already tapped into.

What does this all mean? It means that if we consider Gamestop to be an e-commerce retailer with modest growth potential, the fair market value is somewhere between $230-385 a share. If we got wild and said they had the growth potential of something like ETSY, they would be worth $1,121 per share. I'd say they have room for more than modest growth, but not quite the potential of ETSY. Let's use about 5.6 as a multiple which would give us a **fair market value of $420 per share.**

#Tl;dr: Based on Gamestops full commitment to being an e-commerce retailer, the fair market value of the company is between $15-26billion, or a share price of $230-385.

By the way, this is completely ignoring the fact that we are in the midst of repeated small gamma squeezes and a looming mother of all short squeezes. As a long term investment, Gamestop has the potential to be trading close to and above $400 per share. That is if the market is truly efficient and values Gamestop **based on fundamentals and no outside factors.**

Massive upside potential here. This play has been coiling up for 1.5 months, weak hands have cashed in, and bulls will be entering tomorrow once they cash in some of their tesla tendies. Today we saw strong support at the $3250 level and a solid rally to $3300 with room to go higher tomorrow and over the next month.

From May to July AMZN and AAPL were trending together, which makes sense as they are both tech companies with massive revenue and profits, strong future outlooks, and are a nice stay at home play during covid. For the last 20 days amazon has gone up only 5% while aapl has sky rocketed up 15%, creating a massive 500 point gap for amazon to fill. Don't be fooled by stock price, amazon and aapl are similar in valuation at 1.65 vs 2 trillion market cap.

Amazon had an incredible earnings beat, but seemed like everyone was focused on buying aapl that day for some reason. Amazon heavily reinvests their profits, and doesn't pay a dividend like aapl does, so I suspect people don't recognize how profitable amazon actually is right now, and will be in the future, and are not valuing it correctly because of that. Last quarter actual 10.30 EPS vs 1.74 expected EPS and it barely moved up, this stock is a sleeper about to sky rocket.

# Introduction

Over  the past month, I've been researching stock prospects that I can buy  into for 2021. The pandemic hit everything really hard, and now we are  looking at a potential recovery going into 2021. We saw a huge dip in  the market last week despite **GME** and **AMC**  surging big-time. We've been watching the market do a ton of swings,  with Marijana stocks surging briefly, then dying off, and now there's  been a huge sell-off in the Tech sector--I believe because the market is  transitioning to the Travel sector and not necessarily because of anything fundamentally wrong with the Tech sector.

Coincidentally,  I've also been doing a lot of research into the housing market because I  am looking to move this year into a new home, thanks to the blessing of a well-paying job that allowed me to work from home throughout the pandemic. I noticed some significant trends and parallels with major,  historic economic events that are going to change the landscape of our  economy for decades. In summary, I believe we are on the cusp of a new house market collapse that will mirror and possibly overshadow what we experienced in the 2008 Sub Prime Mortgage crisis.

If you are a well-versed ape who knows their shit when it comes to the  American housing market and how it affects the economy, feel free to skip all this history and go find the stock picks that you can start drawing your green crayon charts with.

# Important References

**The major economic events I am referencing that are most relevant to my research are as follows:**

* The Great Depression (A.K.A. GD)
* Home Owners' Refinancing Act of 1933 (which pulled us out of it)
* The New Deal's Wagner-Steagall Housing Act of 1937 (Also helped in the recovery)
* The Great Recession of 2007
* The Sub-Prime Mortgage Crises of 2008
* The Recession Scare of 2016

# Great Depression & and the Covid 2019 pandemic

**This part is going to be a long analysis on past events on the history of  American Economy in support of this analysis. If you don't care about it  or already know, skip it.**

The most significant economic event in US history was The Great Depression (GD) which began in 1929. Most people don't really understand the real cause.  The main trigger of the GD was that growing industries at  that time which focused on the manufacturing of cheap goods and had historically (at that time) performed really well, were suddenly starting to suffer from consumer lag, meaning nobody was buying their products. Despite this, stocks in many consumer goods and luxuries continued to rise, and the ""Roaring Twenties"" had an overwhelming feeling of optimism. The average debt of American citizens was rising as we began to widely adopt a culture of buying on credit, something we still do heavily today. When people fall into debt, they tighten their belts and stop buying frivolously in order to save money for the essentials.

The Crash finally happened on ""Black Tuesday"" because Wall Street realized that the optimism of the market was no longer feasible, and began selling off shares in huge numbers. Margin buyers (those who buy stocks on credit)  snapped up the ""opportunity"" and basically borrowed the shares with money they could not afford.

Suddenly,  on October 29th, the floor fell out beneath the entire market, and anyone buying on margin was completely wiped out. Consumer debt went through the roof, and everyone scrambled to pull their money out of the banks in order to hold onto what cash they had ... all on the same day.

The banks' vaults were completely wiped out, and when people could not withdraw their money because there was none to withdraw, and the banks could not call in on the debts of people because the banks themselves had no funds to transfer. The entire economy collapsed instantly.  Companies could not afford to buy materials on credit, meaning they could not do business. Businesses closed, and hundreds of thousands of  Americans became jobless overnight, and this was only in the first few months. Homelessness became rampant as hundreds of thousands of  Americans defaulted on their mortgages in the following years. This will be important later.

# How the Covid Pandemic Compares to the Great Depression

**The Covid Pandemic is an exact replica of the events preceding the GD**, but simply masked by different causes. Because of the Covid Pandemic, over 500,000 Americans are dead, mostly seniors, and [unemployment has completely skyrocketed](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R46554.pdf) beyond 14.8% (as of April 2020), though it finally calmed down to roughly 6.7%, though the accuracy of that information is shakey at best because it does not include people who have stopped looking for jobs or have fallen out of the sight of the statistics because they have been rendered homeless.

**The  Covid 19 pandemic essentially triggered a massive and instantaneous halt on consumer spending because so many Americans have lost their jobs--the same trigger that caused the GD. The reason this has not led to a complete collapse of the economy is because of two reasons:**

1. **The  Stimulus Package released last year was almost entirely directed towards businesses in order to prop up the economy. Despite the fact that 20% of Americans are delinquent on rent, and 32% of Americans are late on mortgage payments a vast majority of the stimulus went into businesses and investors that would inject the money into the stock market.**
2. **The moratorium on rent, federal student loans, and mortgage payments, has given Americans a brief respite to recover in the wake of an unprecedented unemployment crisis as a direct result of the pandemic. The money from the stimulus SHOULD have gone to these individuals so they could pay their rent and utilities to avoid an inevitable housing crisis, this action is basically a crutch holding up Americans while they accumulate a massive amount of debt on rent and utilities that they will never be able to pay back. When the moratorium ends, it will be a complete catastrophe.**

# Crawling out of depression via mortgages and bonds

**Skip this if you don't care about how important mortgages and bonds are to the US economy**

The US in the 1930s under Franklin D. Roosevelt took massive steps to rebuild the American economy using Mortgages as the foundation of it. [The Home Owners' Refinancing Act of 1933](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeowners_Refinancing_Act)  enabled the American public to secure their homes by using the federal government as the backer for thousands of mortgages, which guaranteed financial security for the banks. This allowed the banks to give the average American the credit to afford a home and secure employment with affordable refinancing. By the mid 1930s, 20% of urban America successfully refinanced their homes, and the depression began making its turn-around. Basically, all of America now relies on mortgages as a sign of economic health, which became the start of the real ""American Dream"" of owning a home in the 1950s and persists today.

Another way we crawled out was because of US Treasury Bonds, and *ironically* thanks to World War II. Selling bonds is how the US Treasury builds capital to fund huge policies. The prime example of this was the mass sale of **War Bonds** during World War II, which **helped contribute to our pulling out of the GD**. As soon as we went to war in 1941, [more than 80 million Americans purchased war bonds to bring in $180 Billion in revenue](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/warbonds.asp) instantaneously.

# What is a bond? How does it work?

Bonds are essentially an investment in the US government and are generally considered safe. When you buy a 5 year bond say at $100 at a 2% yield,  the bond pays you back 2 dollars for each year you hold the bond. Bonds are ""generally"" safe because they don't lose their value; however, in cases where inflation goes through the roof, bonds ""lose"" money because inflation outpaces the rate of return on the bond. If in 2 years, inflation rises by 6% when the rate of return of my bond is 2%, then I  basically lost 2 dollars in the exchange of my bond. This usually doesn't happen, and supposedly American inflation is secure, but that remains to be seen.

In any case, when bonds are the better pick, the stock market usually halts, which is what happened back during World War II; however, this was because America pulled together to fight what they believed to be the greatest evil of their time. Even Wall Street got a piece of it, and because of that historical trend, when bonds go up, stocks go down. The reason this happens is that when bond yields go up significantly, investors tend to choose bonds because they are safer. That being said, the market reaction to the bond yield rising is pure speculation and unlikely to indicate the market is failing *so far*, but it DOES signal what the US Government is trying to do.

Recently, the stock market has been flying high because of the monetary injections from the stimulus. Everyone is feeling REALLY excited, or they have been up until recently. The market took a HUGE dip on Thursday  (25th) as a result of news that US Treasury Bonds had increased their yield percentage.

# The problem with bonds today and the economic debt situation

Confidence in the US Government is generally not good right now. Our situation today is very different from 1941. Presently, civil unrest for different reasons which we are all aware, have divided the nation, and the response from the government has not inspired much confidence.

That being said, bond sales are *extremely unlikely* to be as steady, or voluminous as they were in 1941, and that is going to force the Treasury to act more drastically in raising the yields. The stock market is going to suffer for it, probably, but more than anything the American Government is going to be setting itself up for disaster.

The US Government is increasing yields on bonds because they are preparing for an inevitable disaster where they are going to need massive amounts of capital to cover the American public when this housing crisis occurs. They would prefer to cover this expense with domestic capital rather than getting loans from its economic partners. That is because they have seen this before, but now we have the knowledge of history and the signals of an impending crisis. I mean... hell, it's obvious at this point.

The reason is that America is going to have to print HUGE amounts of money to pay back the bonds that are bought with what I think are historically higher yields than we've ever seen before. This will drive up inflation, but it would not increase the US Debt. I believe that as a result, the US government may put in a situation where it must pay huge sums of money in order to prop up the economy as we go through the upcoming crisis, they are going to do what they have always done...

*Borrow borrow borrow*

We borrow money, mainly from European allies and China. This is having a detrimental effect on the world's confidence in America's economy, and it is likely going to fall out eventually. In a worst-case scenario, China may call upon America to pay back its debt, though it is unlikely because it would hurt their economy significantly as well.

Nevertheless, China is now the forerunner of the world economy, having completely overshadowed the global market in consumer goods and manufacturing industries. They are also surging ahead in tech and healthcare/pharmaceuticals--historically US-based industries. I don't necessarily believe China would demand a payback when we couldn't possibly do it, they *may* refuse to loan more to the USA, and that will be the trigger of the crisis which I'm about to explain.

# Parallels to the Subprime Mortgage Crisis of 2008 and the Great Recession

**For those of you who have seen ""The Big Short"" or studied the 2008 Financial Crisis and know about this, feel free to skip.**

From 2000 to 2006, because of some highly unscrupulous actions taken by mortgage-lending banks, huge banks like Morgan Stanley and Lehman (which collapsed) accumulated a massive amount of uncovered risk in the form of ""Collateralized Debt Obligations"" or CDOs. A [CDO](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032315/were-collateralized-debt-obligations-cdo-responsible-2008-financial-crisis.asp)  is basically a package of loans that pays back premiums to investors. In the case of the 2008 mortgage crisis, lending banks were selling massive amounts of extremely poor quality or ""Sub Prime Loans"" to people who they knew were highly likely to default (fail to pay the mortgage and lose their house). The housing market was in a huge bubble because small and mid-sized banks were willing to lend INSANE sums of money for people to buy houses. These banks would then bundle up the sub-prime loans along with really good or safe loans, known as AAA (Triple-A) or Prime mortgages. The small banks would then sell these packages of loans for huge, lump sums to the big banks, who would assume control of the interest and premium payments in the form of a CDO, but the CDO would be marked as AAA-rated despite being made up of more than 14% of B-rated mortgages or worse.

Banks continued to do this en-masse, bundling huge amounts of bad loans, until they made up more than 14% of the CDO packages. We're talking BILLIONS of dollars in horrendous, subprime mortgages that were almost guaranteed to fail.

By mid-2007, defaults on loans were through the roof, and more than 14% of the loans in these CDOs were in default. People were losing their homes en-masse, and yet banks continued this terrible lending practice. Some investors took notice and began buying up short positions known as ""[Credit Default Swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditdefaultswap.asp)"" (CDS) on these bad loans. A CDS is basically like buying insurance against a default, meaning that if the majority of these mortgages defaulted, the person who shorted them would earn a massive payout the same way you are paid insurance if your home burns to the ground.

The combination of overwhelming mortgage defaults along with the massive sums of short positions taken up against the American Housing market and the banks that facilitated it completely bankrupted some banks. In the aftermath, the stock market plummeted, bank and hedge fund managers were among over 5,000 new suicides in 2009 in the wake of the disaster that ruined them and their clients financially. The US government was forced to step in and bail out big banks like Morgan Stanley, AIG, and many others in order to prevent a total economic collapse.

As you might have guessed, average Americans never saw a penny of it. Millions of people lost their homes, jobs, and their lives. It was an instantaneous and disastrous crisis that only could be compared to the GD, despite how brief it was.

We are now facing an identical, inevitable, and exponentially worse scenario by September 2021...

# How the market is going to collapse by September (without intervention)

As I mentioned in my references above, over 32% of home-owners and 20% of renters in America are delinquent on payments. Banks are already feeling the pinch because nobody is making payments, but the government has forced them to eat it and say ""tough shit"" until the pandemic is over. [The losses are astronomical](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/14/833920538/americas-largest-bank-jpmorgan-chase-prepares-for-massive-round-of-defaults).

How  I feel personally about these banks is irrelevant, and I do think they are evil incarnate, the fact that nobody can pay their mortgages is a REALLY BAD THING. The problem is that the government only told banks they can't force anyone to pay, nobody can be evicted, and yet the debt continues to grow.

**Without intervention, this is what is going to happen...**

When the moratorium on ~~mortgages and~~ rent finally goes, the American economy is going to collapse under the weight of displaced residents, and the stock market will see a massive pullback from the economic burden. Due to evictions, they won't be able to qualify for mortgages or homes, and rent qualifications will be just as shaky. The end-result is pretty much identical to what we saw in 2008 in terms of debt to income ratio, and the lack of secured housing for millions of Americans. Wall Street and the banks  are doing everything they can to hedge against their inevitable losses from this, but when the defaults finally happen, we can expect more than  [9% of Americans to default](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/us-speculative-grade-default-rate-seen-rising-to-9-by-september-2021-8211-s-p-61424480)

>**Edit note:** I did not correctly interpret forbearance and debt accumuluation. I have come to realize that mortgage forbearance allowed home-owners to cease all payments and defer them entirely. This protection only applies to home-owners though. Renters do not have this protection, and are expected to pay back their debts in full. I still believe that many home owners on B, BB, and BBB-rated loans may have their backs broken by the pandemic regardless and still default on their mortgages. Defaults are still very high, and without intervention, this will break the back of the US economy. Thanks to the degenerates who pointed this out to me.

Unless billions of dollars are injected into the banks in order to cover their losses, on the condition that all delinquent American home owners and renters are COMPLETELY FORGIVEN, this is inevitable, and it is already affecting us.

# What the housing market is doing now and what is about to happen

The housing market has been a ""seller's market"" bubble since May. I know, because I sold my last home at a 45% profit, despite the pandemic in September. I have been looking for a new home to move out of state since December while renting an affordable apartment to accumulate money for a down payment.

While doing my research on homes to move to, I watched houses in the area I was hoping to move drop by an average of 20% in asking price since January. Most American home owners aren't stupid, they know what is coming, and they know they won't be able to pay.

As of December, housing inventory was 1.06 Million homes, down from 1.5 Million in June. Everyone is currently saying ""We're running out of homes"" which has been driving the prices of homes and number of mortgages higher than ever at historically low-interest rates. In the last month, home construction costs being at relatively low prices depending on the area) have allowed property developers, especially on the west coast and rural America to build massive amounts of single and multi-family homes averaging over $400,000 with a 15% profit margin on building costs. Land development and realty companies are looking to take advantage of the seller's market, thinking that they can build enough homes in time to sell at record-high prices. All this sounds like great things for the housing market, but it's about to all come to an end.

>***Edit Note***\*: I made statements here which implied that construction costs on new houses were down for everyone. This is not true for the average home buyer, but\* ***might*** *be true for* ***development companies*** *in areas with easy access to lumber (such as OR, WA, CA, ID, etc). I was misled based on new-home costs in these states, which have easy access to cheap lumber, despite the downturn, and new homes are being built in massive numbers. I appreciate those who pointed this error out to me.* [Some data I was linked](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HOUST)

According to [Black Knight](https://www.blackknightinc.com/blog-posts/slowdown-in-rate-of-forbearance-improvement/), 5.2% of mortgages are in forbearance pending the end of the pandemic protections with a total of 2.7M homes facing default when the forbearance ends. ~~Every one of those people is going to be expected to pay back absolutely everything as soon as the moratorium ends~~ *~~in full~~*~~.~~

**Edit**

>This statement was inaccurate. Mortgage payback is being deferred to the end of loans. This does not apply to renters. Defaults are stil high, and my opinion on a crash remains the same.

The current numbers of new homes on the market is not out as of today, but based on the rate of increase from Zillow, showing an average 13.4% increase in house prices since January to December 2020, and now watching as the collective price of homes suddenly plummeted by 20% on the searches I have done, I see a flood before the comet strikes and they are forced to default. The simultaneous increased home construction and the flood of homes from Americans trying to get out is going to lead to a sudden rise of (I believe) more than 3 million homes. This is going to cause housing prices to plummet, and they already are, ahead of any data or news.

For those Americans too slow or unwilling to sell and cannot pay, eviction is the only alternative. Foreclosures will flood the market, and banks will be forced to auction at dramatically lower prices in order to avoid losing their investments to weather damage as the houses sit empty for months or years.

This will force banks to compensate their losses with higher interest rates. Variable-rate mortgages will feel the squeeze the hardest, and homeowners who were once paying 3% will, in another 2 years, likely see their mortgage interest increase significantly over time. People who are still facing struggles in a post-pandemic America will likely be forced to surrender their homes, but they will get no relief from renters, as they have been put in the same boat as the banks but without any hope of government support, as they are privately owned entities that have much less impact on the economy.

Due to the rent crisis that we are already witnessing unfold, I predict landlords will be forced to raise rent prices to recover their losses from the forbearance. Worse, many will be forced to sell their property because they have their own bills to pay and no income to do so. When rent becomes impossibly high, mortgages are unobtainable, home-owners are forced to refinance at insane rates of interest, and the market inevitably floods with more homes at prices running away to near-worthlessness.

# How in the F-ing hell does ANY of this awfulness have to do with stock market DD!?

**This is the section you've been waiting for**

The pandemic has financially crippled the American economy, and the stimulus package that was released is currently propping everything up. In the end, I'm expecting the housing market to crash VERY Hard. However, unlike Michael Burry, I'm taking up long positions in what I believe are going to be very important businesses that will provide the necessities for Americans as the crisis unfolds.

1. **Moving and Storage companies - CUBE UHAL EXR**

When people are forced to move, the first thing they have to do is collect their belongings and put them somewhere. This crisis is going to force Americans to move out of their homes and apartments en-masse, and it's going to be an absolute brutal disaster. I believe that people are already getting ahead of this by selling off their homes, and they will start putting their stuff into places they can afford, mobile or climate-controlled storage units.

I want to be clear, the idea of this is utterly depressing to me... but the first stock that is going to skyrocket ahead of the market downturn is moving companies, and storage units. U-Haul, owned my Amerco, does both, and they have packaged deals. The company has done nothing but made stupid money since it was founded post WW2. But in the years leading up to the 2008 crisis and in the 6 years after it ended, Uhaul made INSANELY STUPID money.

&#x200B;

[Amerco\/UHAL stock analysis & historical performance \(1995-2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/qlvlfmamfik61.jpg?width=1708&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4e1d14b30c267551414bc1a6be8b57944ce5e5d)

Besides Amerco/UHAL, EXR (Extra Space Storage) and CUBE (CubeSmart) are both making huge moves in the market and despite being in direct competition,  typically keep to their own respective areas of the nation where they do the most business. Because of this, they don't steal each other's clients. Being national companies, they offer much better rates, on average, than private/family owned storage facilities.

Since  UHAL is the only company on this list old enough to have been a  national brand at the time of the 2008 crisis, it is the only real litmus test I have pulled up for how the market will react and how they will make their money. Because CUBE is much cheaper, I have thrown my bets on them, and I anticipate good news on Monday.  


>**Edit:**  
Monday was a sell-off after CUBE beat earnings, and my calls dipped due to dividend-whores. Outlook is still very bullish.

[My positions disclosure as of 3\/2 \(couldn't get off RH yet\)](https://preview.redd.it/g7sce0l0hnk61.jpg?width=655&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=048f2078c6f0ab2937ec5dd93f478943930482b9)

CUBE announced earnings this weekend, and I'm anticipating the price to rise sharply on good announcements that they strongly outpaced their earnings once the transcripts go public. At any point they dip, I have every intention to start buying up stocks, even if my calls expire worthless. This is a very LONG play, and I do not advise anyone to copy my trades unless you have the capital to spare. Just like UHaul in the wake of the pandemic, they dipped HARD, but after their latest earnings announcement, absolutely blew through the roof.

Options on CUBE are cheap right now, and I am willing to throw $800 down on that bet. Even if CUBE only goes up by $1 per share after earnings are public, that's break-even for me. I'm also expecting that other investors are going to get behind this trend and start buying up shares in these sectors as well, ahead of a mortgage crisis.

If I had more capital, I would throw money down on UHaul at the first sign of a dip, but at the present, this is what I have available. I can say the same about EXR. If I had the money, I'd diversify these calls, but I still consider this a worthwhile risk for an initial investment. I believe EXR has higher loss-tolerance because they have a higher market cap and more facilities, but fundamentally, they are identical to CUBE, with the caveat that CUBE has more facilities in high-density urban areas on average--at least according to the research I've been able to turn up.

Cubesmart still has solid fundamentals, they've beat earnings expectations every quarter last year, and had a 3% increase on dividends in December. With over a $7 Billion market cap, they have money to burn, and I think they'll come out huge at the end of this. Even with the pandemic hurting everyone, I am expecting a big push on Monday and the weeks to follow.

2. Cheap Goods and Wholesale $OSTK $COST $WMT $AMZN

My pick here is Overstock ($OSTK), but Cost-Co Walmart and Amazon are other obvious picks for people who can afford them. Sadly, a LOT of Americans are going to be very desperate as they face homelessness and have to bargain for essentials and cheap furniture. I don't like Walmart or Amazon because I disagree with their business practices as a whole, but you can't argue with their long-term performance and their success. That being said, they're safe bets even in a post-pandemic market disaster.

Fundamentally, I find  Overstock is WAY undervalued at $67 per share, especially at their recent high of $102 that got rejected in August 2020. They have been absolutely crushing expectations, and the only reason I believe they are so undervalued is because of the stiff competition and attention  whoring of Amazon and walmart. At < $70, $OSTK is at a huge discount.  I plan on buying shares with them, since options are unpredictable. Currently waiting on funds to settle, but I have limit positions set at 100 shares $80 limit price.

Call options on this one are higher due to recent volatility, but OTM calls a  few months out are still cheap. Assuming the price doesn't skyrocket (like I think it will in a couple months), and OSTK settles in at \~$80  per share, I plan on buying more share and calls as soon as the market  collapses, assuming I'm right about the housing market.

3. Travel industry $CAR $LUV $UAL

In the wake of the pandemic, travel industry froze overnight, which caused an immediate downturn. Nevertheless, the big names have been able to survive all this time, and some are doing better than ever now that restrictions have lifted and the market has shown its confidence by buying back into $CAR (Avis budget group) and $LUV (Southwest Airlines) hugely. I believe that $UAL (United Airlines) is lagging behind the trend at the moment because the market is awaiting reactions to a recent engine explosion that happened on a Boeing 777 flight. I am anticipating that the news is going to show that Boeing is the cause for blame, but if you are unsure, you could always do a straddle/strangle strategy on UAL. The price is likely to move sharply in one direction or the other, so it's a 50-50 shot. Fundamentally, UAL isn't going anywhere, since they service tons of international and domestic flights in the US.

The travel industry is exploding more because of people just itching to get free and travel again and not necessarily because of a housing market fiasco; however, it's worth pointing out that $CAR also owns Budget Truck, which is in the same vein as UHAL, which I've already discussed that I'm long on.

Fundamentally ABG is a strong company that is highly diversified across rental cars, trucks, vans, and even have rental-purchase agreements with used car dealerships which are likely to be a huge revenue stream once their older vehicles cycle out of their service lifetime. $CAR had to cut almost half its workforce because of the pandemic in order to preserve capital. They survived, and the market responded by exploding their price to $55.55, just barely under 20% of their previous ATH of $68.89. I expect them to continue to beat their previous performance, mainly because most of $CAR's competition got decimated by the pandemic and many of them still have not recovered. It's difficult to say if they will continue to move up as sharply as they have recently, but $60 OTM calls for 3/19 are absolutely within reason, in my opinion. These calls are currently very cheap at $2.15/contract, but if you're risk-averse, setting up a position to expire farther out, or simply buying a bunch of their stock while it's still reasonably priced are both good long-term strategies for me.

Again, I'm a  poor bitch, so I'm limited on capital and don't currently have a position in $CAR or $LUV, but they're both my personal picks, and I hope to place market buys as soon as my recently traded funds settle next week.

# Closing thoughts

**I  am also paying very close attention to the overseas healthcare, professional service, alternative energy and tech sectors, as I believe a lot of those jobs will start heading overseas as the US economy begins to tank. I'm looking at Japan, China, Taiwan, and Canada the closest.**

For the record and full disclosure, I am also holding 500 shares of AMC (TO  THE MOON!!!), which I believe will reflect the sentiment of the public ahead of travel restrictions lifting completely. If people are willing to throw money at movie theaters, people are going to start traveling soon after that, and the outlook is promising for that.

There are other sectors that are likely to do well in the wake of the upcoming economic turmoil, and you can be assured that Wall Street is well aware of them. Even if the prediction makes me feel sick, I think the best thing I can do, personally, is to do something to pull some money out of this pending disaster so that I have the funds to put back some good into the world.

I'm looking for feedback on the DD, and I hope that I can get some other people's opinion on whether I might be right or wrong about this. Part of me wants to be very wrong, and I want there not to be another economic crisis, but it feels inevitable.

## What Exactly Happened at Robinhood This Week?

There has been plenty of speculation this week about what exactly went down and unverified (although reasonable) rumors on why Robinhood did this. I’ll go over the top two theories before taking a deep dive into the “official” reason given by Robinhood.

[**Pressure from the White House and Sequoia according to a Robinhood employee**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/l723kf/robinhood_insider_information/)

This statement has been [refuted by Sequoia](https://www.newsweek.com/sequoia-capitol-denies-pressuring-robinhood-stop-gamestop-trading-after-viral-reddit-post-1565269). I personally wouldn’t believe the Sequoia part since I don’t really know what they would gain from it - they’re a Venture Capital firm, not a hedge fund, and would not be actively shorting stocks let alone be trading in stocks. It could be possible that the White House, or someone from the government did contact Robinhood - actually, I’d be pretty shocked if no one called them at some point this week to ask wtf was going on.During this call, they may have been afraid that GameStop’s short squeeze would have triggered a major financial crisis due to hedge funds collapsing and de-grossing, causing a mass selloff similar to what was seen in 2008 and in March 2020 - I’ll talk more about this later. Basically, without Robinhood shutting down GME from being bought, it’s actually very possible we would have seen the rest of the stock market collapse last week, and this was something the Biden administration was trying to make sure didn’t happen in the first month in office.

**Possible intervention from Citadel Securities**

This was a theory I personally believed in initially and would have been a very obvious area of scrutiny for many people. The most straightforward one being the fact that Citadel (the hedge fund) dumped a few billion into Melvin to bail it out a [few days ago](https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340), who were the very well known shorts of GME. Citadel, the hedge fund, is owned by Citadel LLC, which happens to also run Citadel Securities - a market maker. If you don’t know what this is, go grow a few brain wrinkles and read my [previous post about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5ygab/dddd_how_rwallstreetbets_created_a_financial/). Citadel Securities is effectively Robinhood’s sugar daddy, directly being responsible for around [40% of their revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/18/a-controversial-part-of-robinhoods-business-tripled-in-sales-thanks-to-high-frequency-trading-firms.html) in 2018 through their payment for order flow (i.e. selling your trades to Citadel, giving them the right of first refusal, and [potentially giving you a worse price](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321); this is how they get 0% commission trades btw).

Theoretically, Citadel the hedge fund and Citadel the market maker is run independently and sister companies both owned by Citadel LLC, but anyone can see this being a potential conflict of interest. There’s also a possibility that Citadel Securities losing billions of dollars being short so many GME calls (they write 99% of all options contracts) and probably not being perfectly Gamma and (especially) Vega hedged, so when those two greeks skyrocketed on GME they probably lost tons of money there. [According to WSB hero Chamath](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354947541125611526), he didn’t invest in Robinhood when they came to him on multiple occasions because he thought the founders lacked integrity, implying he believes they might have been the type of people to sell out their users (granted, they already literally do this) and do this type of shit.

**The Official Reason - Clearing House Limitations**

Let’s get to the [official reason put out by Robinhood](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility), which is that their clearing house, in this case the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp, suddenly increased their collateral requirements on GME trades drastically. Apparently, **Robinhood is running out of cash**, so they weren’t able to provide the cash collateral demanded by DTCC, and hence weren’t able to trade through them. Let’s dumb this down and talk about how brokerages work.

Let’s talk about what a clearing house is and how they work. Imagine Bob wants to sell Dylan a share of GME. There’s a bunch of legal paperwork and logistics for actually transferring over the share, which can take a few days to finalize - this is called settlement. However, you don’t want people being able to back out of this exchange during this process for obvious reasons, so that’s where the clearing house comes in. Let’s call this clearing house Mary. What Mary does is facilitate (clear) this exchange, and ensures both Bob and Dylan follow through with their trade by having them both immediately give Mary cash as collateral while the exchange settles. If one party was no longer able to meet their end of the exchange (eg. Dylan goes bankrupt), Mary acts as an insurer and is responsible for buying the share from Bob instead. If it turned out that Bob was lying about actually owning a share and can't transfer it over to Dylan in time (failure to deliver), Mary is responsible for finding that share for him instead.

Since GME suddenly became very volatile, and the financial soundness of some parties and their ability to deliver their side of the trade have been suddenly called into question ([at least on the seller’s side](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)), DTCC decided  (...or due to pressure from other sources?) to increase the collateral needed for buying GME to be more than 10x of the proportion of the market value of whatever it was before. Most brokerages reacted to this by disabling margin trading. For some reason, Robinhood went one step further and disabled trading for all accounts, possibly due to their relatively small cash reserves compared to places like Fidelity, and the relatively large number of users who use margin in the platform.

## What’s Robinhood Going To Do About GME?

Robinhood’s decision to stop purchases of GME basically got hate from literally everyone, to the point where it somehow united the country in a beautiful way. Here’s a list of things that happened as a result of Robinhood’s decision, for fun

* [SEC investigation to Robinhood’s decision](https://www.cnet.com/news/robinhood-troubles-sec-will-closely-review-actions-that-restricted-amc-gamestop-stock-trades/)

Clearly, this decision has single-handedly made Robinhood the most hated company in the world right now. It’s especially bad given the optics - their mission is to literally “democratize finance”, with the idea of empowering individual retail investors to be on the same level of institutions. This decision, whether intentional or not, has literally gone against everything about Robinhood’s image and mission, and will end the company if not fixed soon. **All of this right as Robinhood is planning to launch their IPO**.

The people in charge of Robinhood likely know all of this and are doing everything they can to find cash and liquidity to put up the collateral needed to resume GME trading. So far we’ve seen them raise $1B from investors and $500M through lines of credit overnight, although based on the fact that GME is still restricted, that doesn’t seem to be enough. However, in my personal opinion, I think it's likely that Robinhood is doing everything they can to find more money given the situation, and once they do, **they will likely re-enable trading on GME. If that happens (which IMO will probably be some time next week), GME and all other high-SI stocks will absolutely** 🚀🌝\*\*.\*\*

## How GME Almost Caused (and Still Can Cause) a Stock Market Crash

Let’s go over something else interesting that went on as a result of the GME short squeeze - the fact that it started to affect the stock market overall. In fact, the stock market had the largest decline since October across all sectors on Wednesday when GME, AMC, and other high-SI stocks surged, with a very sharp recovery as the meme stocks fell after Robinhood suspending purchases; this was one of the biggest de-grossing of hedge funds in history. [Chamath wrote a great Twitter thread about this](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354883147523997697), so amazing that I’ll just copy-paste his tweets rather than try to explain it better myself.

[Hedge fund grossing \/ de-grossing](https://preview.redd.it/c5we1d7e0se61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a11131168d69e5f3aea93c8fd087a1478500ddc)

In other words, as stocks like GME go up, the highly-leveraged hedge funds that are shorting these stocks are forced to sell their longs as they cover their shorts. Most retail investors are limited to 2x leverage, but since hedge funds are “hedged” by taking short and long positions, they can be up to 30x levered since theoretically they would be shielded from external events that cause all stocks to go up or down in price (i.e. Beta neutral), so they’re “safer”. To get out of these short positions, they will need to massively unwind their long positions as well so they can still have a reasonable “Net Exposure”, triggering a sell-off in those stocks.

A very similar thing actually happened in March (with risk-parity) causing hedge funds to similarly massively de-gross, and literally everything from GLD to even AMZN’s stock price dropping as a result, even though theoretically COVID-19 would’ve been good for both from a fundamental basis, as we saw later on. It’s very likely that if Robinhood hadn’t stopped purchases of GME, many more hedge funds shorts would have had their shorts blow up and be forced to continue to de-gross causing a widespread stock market crash, potentially being the catalyst for finally popping the [decade-long liquidity (leverage)-fueled asset bubble we’ve been experiencing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcfn5/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble/) In fact, this could still happen since it doesn’t look like hedge funds have learned their lesson and **are still heavily short GME with Net Shares Shorts barely moving this week** [**according to S3 Partners**](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1355225495835709441)**.** Furthermore, despite seeing the largest de-grossing of hedge funds since 2009, **gross exposure (aka leverage) of hedge funds still remains** [**close to record-high levels**](https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-hedgefunds/goldman-sees-hedge-fund-exposures-close-to-records-ongoing-sell-off-risk-after-gamestop-swings-idUSL1N2K60GW).

**TLDR**

In case your attention span was too short to read everything above,

1. Robinhood is going to be doing everything they can to raise cash to resume GME purchases, when this happen GME 🚀🌝
2. Much of the stock market’s value is held by over-leveraged hedge funds, so **if GME (and other common shorts) 🚀🌝 the rest of the stock market might collapse around it (EDIT - as hedge funds re-consider their long / short strategy), triggering a financial crisis**

*Now, just to be clear, buying GME right now is joining a game of hot potato; the longer you hold the potato the more tendies you get to eat for dinner, but at some point this will all blow up and when it does someone will be the bagholder - and right now everyone is rooting for these bagholders to be the hedge funds that are short GME. That being said, with Short Interest barely moving this week, this day of reckoning doesn’t look like it’ll be coming in the next few days and for reasons mentioned above, it’s probably more likely for GME to reach $1K next week than the probability that it’ll fall below $100.*

Or in other words, [I like these stocks](https://www.highshortinterest.com/).

EDIT - Appearently S3 Partners just contradicted [their tweet on Friday](https://s3partners.com/Exclusive.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=announcement&utm_campaign=10ds) and now indicate that shares short of GME have dipped below 30M shares. Still highly shorted compared to most other stocks, fwiw.

EDIT2 - Getting alot of questions on how one short position in a small cap can do this, and my answer is that GME alone wouldn't cause a financial crisis, but rather what GME represents, which is disproving that hedge funds that a long / short strategy (i.e. taking out additional leverage to short similar companies they long) is unviable; The word from my hedge fund friends is that this type of thing would have been considered a six-sigma event, or one in a billion chance of happening; which is obviously no longer true. Hedge funds seeing Melvin go down will probably start re-consider their short books. This on mass will cause a mass short-covering and also sell-off of their longs.

2021-02-12 14:17:49,PLTR DD - brain cells required if you are an ape!,"Hello fellow retards

I know these are difficult times for this sub and it’s almost impossible to post something solid which is not about the current meme stocks.

Instead of jerking to some porn i did some research on PLTR and want to share my DD with you. This might be a longer text for your love dopamine level so maybe you should grab some your Adderall before.

The following text might you give your eyes aids since English isn’t my native language. I will try my best.

**Palantir as a Company – the beginnings**

PLTR was founded by some people and one of them is Peter Thiel who worked alongside with our holy papa Elon at PayPal. As a payment-service they had concerns about money laundering and founded PLTR to tackle this issue early. The CIA also funded PLTR (they are always funding stuff like this – Siri as example). This actually might be the reason why people think that PLTR is a company which aggregates data and do data analysis for the government….but this is not accurate and not correct at all if you see the big picture. I will explain this point later.

You retard still reading? Nice here some rocket emoji’s to pump your dopamine and keep you happy. 🚀🚀🚀

Let’s start with the DD

First of all my POV is looking for a midterm to long term investment in PLTR. My valuation considers PLTRs current state and predicting from now on for the next few years.

&#x200B;

* **1. The Management**

Before I start with the product I rather start with the management. You can sell the nicest thing in the world. I can guarantee you that the product definitely won’t be considered as the nicest thing after a while if you have a shitty management (Intel). With Peter Thiel on the leaderboard we got a competent asshole and CEO is Alex carp (co-founder) Peter Thiel is well known and Alex Karp is one of us. He yolod his heritage into some business and become a chad. Seriously tho, I trust Peter and if Peter holds on Alex since Decades so do I. Peter proved so many times how cunning he is and showed how to pick adapt problems early and create solutions.

&#x200B;

* **2. PLTR Business model/ products**

Before we understand how important PLTRs products are we have to understand that we are simpeltons who don’t have any business with PLTRs. We create data. We don’t fuck with it. We creating with using our phones or working in the office. Only a few of us may working with accumulated big data. PLTRs customers’ base isn’t neighbor Joe or Aunt Nancy. The products they offer are not even for midcap companies they are more designed for whole industries and governments. That’s the reason why their products aren’t so tangible for many people.

PLTR basically offers systems to big companies/governments which import their data into these systems. PLTR doesn’t sends workers to the client to collect data and analyse it. They sell platforms. They got 2 Products called “Gotham” and “Foundry” You may think wtf is this guy talking about? Let me explain it in 2 examples:

First example is Syria with Gotham. It was impossible in the country to know who the good guys are and who the bad ones are. I know u muricans only know yourself and the rest of the world is the “rest of the world” for you. But this wasn’t so simple in Syria you had many factions with different intentions and some of them were allies and some of them were enemies. The lack of information or the ability of recognizing and sorting these information’s are crucial in a war. PLTR solved the struggle with creating a map which provided resilient information for the marines so they can operate safely. Civil problems over there could also be fixed.

[https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/)

Actually what the John Hopkins University does with the covid numbers and the map, is some sort of what PLTR offering with their solutions. There are rumors that the tracking of Covid and the vaccination will be done by PLTR.

In their S1 Form PLTR describes it this way

“Gotham, our first software platform, was constructed for analysts at defense and intelligence agencies. They were hunting for needles not in one, but in thousands of haystacks. And they did not have the software they needed to do their jobs. In Afghanistan and Iraq, soldiers were mapping networks of insurgents and makers of roadside bombs by hand. Gotham enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, and helps U.S. and allied military personnel find what they are looking for.”

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406\_11](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406_11)

The second example is about “Foundry” and it’s directly from the S1 File of PLTR (page 121)

“An Airbus A350, for example, has five million parts and is built by hundreds of teams that are spread across four countries and more than eight factories. Companies routinely struggle to manage let alone make sense of the data involved in large projects. Foundry was built for them. The platform transforms the ways in which organizations interact with information by creating a central operating system for their data.”

Both of these systems solving big issues with less effort. The arms industry as example would took billions for drones and stuff in Syria for the same job. The important fact is that PLTR does not spend so much resources for new clients they only have to provide access and support for their services and the client feeding the “machine” with data.

The key point is to understand that PLTR benefits very huge from economy of scales. This is very important since their costs for additional revenue is basically flat while the profits growing exorbitant with new customers. They offer a software and platforms and not kind of services where they need man power. All they do is working on their platforms and improving it.

&#x200B;

* **3. PLTRs big issue during the last decade**

Peter Thiel was a great supporter of Trump and funded his elections campaign. The market thought that when trump wins then PLTR will get all the government (especially military) contracts.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html)

But this didn’t happened. Peter got cucked by the huge authority apparatus in pentagon. These dudes loves bureaucracy and they do it for a good reason. If you retire from your job in pentagon you usually get a high paid luxurious position at Lockheed, Raytheon or Bae Systems to make additional free money for your retirement. Many thousand people working in pentagon just to select and buy stuff for the government. They spending billions of dollars for purchases and then PLTR came around and said like „look guys we can do this job for a few millions instead billions“. Of course the arms industry was pissed and the pentagon boomers helped them out. PLTR got constantly scammed from boomers and didn’t get the contracts. This was also the „swamp „trump was talking about.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-28/inside-palantir-s-war-with-the-u-s-army](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-28/inside-palantir-s-war-with-the-u-s-army)

A fun fact to this matter: Before James Mattis got summoned as the Defense Secretary of the USA he was a general in Afghanistan. He ordered services from PLTR despite the fact the pentagon was against it. But the marines praised PLTRs software and valued it over the trash they used to know from the defense/arms industry.

*Processing img 2os8izwwe4h61...*

Even with a James Mattis as the defense secretary, trump as president and regardless that PLTR does it better and cheaper than the arms industry, it wasn’t possible for PLTR to get the government contracts.

[https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373)

[https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/](https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/)

How it’s ended? Well Peter’s wife doesn’t have a boyfriend because Peter is the fucking boyfriend of their wifes. All ended at the court and PLTR won. All this injustice ended at the court. The judgements on these cases are true circuit breakers for PLTR. Not only because PLTR spent shit tons of money for law suits. The lawsuits were perfect uppercut hits on the arms industry and they ended some fraudulent behaviors and „best practices „in the government

[https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/)

PLTR will profit from a Biden who wants to decrease the military expenditures. They will get the job done and at the same time the costs will go down. With the recent judgements the door looks open.

&#x200B;

* **4. Valuation problems**

I could spam some multiplication on revenue or even a DCF but I think it’s not necessary. Expect the costs of research and development (maybe marketing) the costs of PLTR stood mostly flat in the last quarters. It’s a growth stock and the pricing is mostly in the perspective of PLTR. This is actually all we need to know that the revenue increases while the costs staying mostly flat. Check out the balance sheets at page 12 on the S Form 1.

Let’s talk about the market. The whole market seems overpriced but it isn’t tbh. Due to the low cost of capital there is no alternative than to throwing your money on stocks or on real estate. There is nothing with a solid interest rate around (not even in emerging markets). At the stock exchange like in 70s, the companies had to offer a return, a perspective which should be more attractive as putting your money on a saving account with 8% interests without risks. These times are gone since the 2000s. So before people discuss insane valuation they should check out the fiscal and economical policies.

Now back to PLTR and why the price is difficult to set (cheap imo). First of all PLTR did a direct listing without an investment bank for their share offerings. Its lacking of the valuation which they usually would get through such a process.

PLTR wanted to do IPO with Morgan Stanley but it was mess.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears)

Morgan Stanley proved themselves many times as stubborn communists when it comes to valuations. I mean you guys remember their disgusting price targets for tesla like 100$ post split or stuff like that.

These guys are very focused on numbers and I know it’s difficult to price in the potential and perspectives. But you can’t ignore these things for a fundamental valuation. If you want to consider these things in the price you have to understand the business of the company.

This ended that one team at Morgan Stanley valuated PLTR with 5 billion while another team thought they worth 40 billion.

[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html)

How is this difference possible and why is this happening? Because people don’t understand what they are valuating. This happened a lot in the last decade because the decision makers in these banks and many analyst don’t have any idea which metrics they should use on companies like that. They are using the metrics from classical industries on new business. They freaked out when Facebook was valued with 100 billion as IPO. Same with Twitter and in the last years it was Tesla. They said apple going to tank every damn year in the last decade. I honor Warren Buffet so much since he has the dignity to realize that he don’t understands something but at the same time he sees the potential and the trend. That’s why he hired 2 Chads who bought Snowflake for him. The transformation and the generation change didn’t happened yet. That’s why they try to use the metrics from Caterpillar on Tesla.

Guys the whole market is mooning with the cheap liquidity. Pennystocks and zombie companies transforming into billion dollar market cap companies. Facebook as IPO had a market cap of 104 billion back in 2012. At that time it wasn’t possible for Facebook to monetize their users with selling ads. They just paid 100 billion for the potential in more difficult market conditions.

Look at the IPOs like doordash, Bumble. I’m not going to call this a bubble. Just check out their business cases and use the metrics. Maybe its easier for people to understand Bumble and Doordash…

On page 12 of the S1 (balance sheet) Form you can already see the huge positive trends in PLTRs revenue and their costs. All this without all the positive events and contracts PLTR recently got.

PLTRs valuation is difficult and I think it’s miscalculated by pessimistic communist who don’t understand that their products are game changers for industries, governments and defense forces. Because of these points I think there is huge price potential for PLTR

&#x200B;

* **5. Risks for PLTR**

Despite the general market risks PLTR mentions at page 29 of the S1 Form the competitors as the main risk: “We face intense competition in our markets, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.” The S1 Form didn’t aged well. Actually I don’t think that PLTR would have any trouble with offering new shares. Also with Peter Thiel as one of the founders the financial side should be stable.

As PLTR competitor people use to mention IBM. The boomers from IBM already surrendered with their Windows95 computers and decided to cooperate. The biggest threat would be big tech with big money like AMZN or APPL. You all now the stories about APPL and Spotify or AMZN and all the merchants. Even if the big players would step into PLTR markets it would be difficult for them since PLTRs products doesn’t rely on an Amazon store or on apple devices. PLTR is years ahead with their products.

I think the greatest risk (still) are the boomerish arms industry and all the boomers in pentagon and other authorities.

There are very corrupt infrastructures when it comes to decision making and assigning contracts. People fear changes but they can’t avoid the changes. With the recent judgements we can see a turn on the tables but the transformation will still take time. It’s a circuit breaker with an avalanche effect.

The risk factors on page 16 on the S1 form mostly aren’t relevant anymore. People complained that PLTR wasn’t profitable for 18 years. Well PLTR was never designed to be profitable and Alex Karp once said “love us or leave us alone”.

But even this changed recently. PLTR became profitable in 2020 with 130,000,000§. Now the same people complaining about how high the stock price compared to the profits. Well just you wait.

* **6. Conclusion and Outlook**

If you still reading I have to admit that this was a lot text and i am sorry again about the lingo. Let’s connect the dots and bring this information to a point

1. The boomer coalition in the pentagon and in the arms industry is taken down by PLTR. They will able to get the governments contracts and the classic arms/defense industry is no match for PLTR products. The judgements of lawsuits were catalyst and the effects should be already shown in the next earnings. These were such underrated events but I think there still will be some odds but PLTRs situation is much better as it was a time ago. The chains are off!
2. Military expenditures rising worldwide

[https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion)

With Bidens presidency we will see more disruptive technologies chosen by the government. Biden want to reduce the military expenditures. PLTR is able to provide better service for lower cost. Not only the recent judgements also the political change will help PLTR. Ironic if you remember that Peter supported Trump and getting his tendies from Biden.

3. PLTR superior products profits hugely from economy of scales. They don’t have any significant costs when they acquire new customers. Making the big data usable for decisions making is already very important and step by step people realize that this issue growing fast. We creating everyday more data than we did yesterday and leaving the majority of it as trace and unstructured data. We don’t work with it but big Institutions does.

Here is the passage from the S1 and I fully agree with it:

“The systemic failures of government institutions to provide for the public — fractured healthcare systems, erosions of data privacy, strained criminal justice systems, and outmoded ways of fighting wars — will continue to require both the public and private sectors to transform themselves. We believe that the underperformance and loss of legitimacy of many of these institutions will only increase the speed with which they are required to change.”

4. PLTRs value. The current situation of the market with tons of liquidity seems like a bubble. People don’t know what to do with the cheap capital and people throwing it even on meme pennystocks.

Facebook had his ipo back in 2012 during much harder market conditions as now. The valuation of Facebook was over 100 billion and people called it insanely overvalued. They did it because Facebook didn’t had a way to monetize their users (especially on mobile platforms). Facebook has a market cap of over 750 billion now and nobody calling it over valued.

A remember the recent examples? Bumble?! Bruuuh. Don’t get me wrong if you invested in Bumble but they have nothing special to offer and their business case can easily copied or improved by others. Its shows the current state of our market with the crazy liquidity that even zombie companies got astronomic valuations. Use these metrics on PLTR with great products, great management, low cost base and less odds as ever before….

PLTR price is wrong imo especially in this market and with PLTRs current state and perspective.

5. Do you use PLTR? Me Neither! It’s not designed for us and we have to inform us about the success. PLTRs new contracts and their future are shining bright. With the settled lawsuits the sky is clear for PLTR. But their customer base is not only America. I’m not a murican and 3 weeks before I just find out that the police departments in our state using PLTR products. I don’t need to link endless evidences here since you can google it by yourself and see how many contracts PLTR recently got. Especially after the circuit breakers we talked about.

I have genuinely trust into Peter Thiel and Alex Karp that their will make the best of PLTRs potential. The odds getting removed and the demand for PLTR is increasing.

If all these information would priced in correctly we would have a share price of at least 60-70$.  With upcoming and ongoing positive events PLTR share price should soar more..

**What’s next?**

Now we have earnings ahead and the lock up period ending.

For the earnings I think the number will be fine and keep up the positive trend on revenue with a disproportionately trend of the costs. The most important part will be guidance for 2021. We should listen closely and see if the magic is already happening.

The second event is the ending of the lock up period. You all remember the end of the lock up period of Nikola? Just 1-2 days after they announced they don’t got the GM deal? The stock tanked – for a good reason. You know the guy Trevor Milton.

But in PLTRs case everything is different. Despite the successful deals they got, does a guy who says “love us or leave us alone” sounds like someone who going to drop his shares at the first possibility? I don’t expect such a behavior from Alex Karp and neither from Peter Thiel. If some employees drop their shares it should be fine.

I would appreciate if the stock prices would go below 3ß. It would create a healthy bullish chart pattern and would be actually a nice discount to get in or stock up. I don’t think that the shares going to dump a lot because of this event. The earnings and the guidance are more important and the key events if you want to invest mid – long term.

What does all this means for you? Nothing! Please don’t do any market activity based on my DD. I’m just sharing my knowledge and looking for critics so I can reevaluate my theses. This is not a financial advice.

My hearts bleeding for all the GME holders. My last Reddit account got banned because I criticized “the pumpers”. In one of the comments I called the mods gay and got banned permanently (bye bye 20 k karma). If you are new to this please don’t do any decision based on this so I can sleep gladly.

I’m not well positioned and not trying to pump this stock. I have 70 shares and a CSP. Fair play and fuck all the bots and pump and dumper we recently got in the sub!

2021-03-15 19:48:10,RKT The Rocket Companys: Cheap and Hated,"RKT ipo'd at $19 back in August.  The Gilford family spent 35 year building them into the largest mortgage orginator in the world.  They survived every downturn even the '07 Mortgagepocolypse, each time growing and taking share.

They didn't need no cash, they came public to establish themselves in the public market and begin planning for the some day when death taxes require the family to settle up with the irs.

The Gilfords built a $50 Billion company from scratch, its a story right up there with Buffet and Bezos but this family gets no respect.   They should.  

The biz:

Banks make loans, sometimes they make the mortgage thing to apes who have ""civilized"" and live in house things.  I sleep in the woods and swing from trees, but many of my so called 'evolved' cousins like this house living bullshit.  Well banks only have a handful of people in house who loan house mortages (i know weird).  They rely on these fly by night boiler rooms who send emails and call you unexpectedly, you think its about your car warranty or solar but this is that other sales call about Refi-Cash-Out into a Fixed Fully Ammortizing 30 year or buying a rental with a 5/1 ARM Fixed-Floating with rolled in closing costs.  

Its really a bunch of bullshit, mortgages, roofs, solar panels.  I like bananas, but I like this stonk called RKT.  

Morgages are hard, they want paperworks, bank statements, adp payroll slips.  The business comes in waves.  When rates are cheap and banks full of new dollar tokens given to them by  JPOW, there is a long line of house living apes trying to mortage their paychecks from 30 years on so they can install a pool or move to a neighborhood with a country club.  So the banks call on these boiler rooms to make all the paper mortgage calls happen.

These 'orginiators' are typically like circus pop up tent companies.  They hire a bunch of unemployed used car saleman and maniacs froms the sober house to call the leads and take the applications.  They hire Amanda and Britney who couldn't succeed as beauticians to do the document reviews and processing.  Simply put its the cast of heros you used to see on episodes of COPS where the call was a 'domestic.'  

But the Gilfords had a vision: build software that runs on devices that make it so easy to apply, qualify and process a mortgage that even Rodney with 5 days outa rehab and Britney 'I told your ass to send me that already' couldn't screw it up and the customer gets their house money fast and easy right from the app on their handheld glowing glass screen.

Hedge funds don't understand how good this software is.  No one else bothered to build it because bankers are not creative, they live by screwing others.  And the other circus freaks pushing mortgages are in it for next week commish check so they can coke and hookers.  

Stonk is at $26

The Hedges shorted 40 mil shares on a 115 mil float.  And index fund already bought 11 mil shares (invesco).   The original fund managers who bought the ipo sold it out during the last blast up to $43.  They sold, bc they saw morgage rates go up a 1/2 point and figured the circus is over and all these pop up freak show mortgage boiler rooms are going under.  They didn't bother to look at rkt.  They have a 90% repeat business rate: meaning 9/10 customers who do a mortgage with rocket, will use rocket if they do another.  typicall number in bankin is 1 or 2 out of 10.  RKT app is number 1 in the catagory, and as Mamma Cathy Wood teached me smooth ape brain: innovation is a winner take all game.  

RKT builds back better each downturn, and every mortgage boom brings in startup circus creeps that don't know how to code, analyst customer data (data science) and deliver good service.  Why should they? they believe its a churn and burn business.  They are running flee market stores, RKT is runnnin and Amazon of mortgages and now getting into car and personal loans

They don't take credit risk, they lend for banks and investor pools.  they ""service"" the loan which means they bill and collect.  so when rates fluctuate they have to adjust the holding value of the collection rights up or down any quarter.  Hedgefunds predict that higher rates mean they take a write down.  But thats just paper bullshit.  the collection rights always are profitable, they just have to 'discount' them when banks same interest is worth more.  Hedgefunds look for quick profits, not revolutionary businesses that make lives better.

They missed tsla, apple, amzn and countless others the same way.  RKT is no diff.

The company minted coin in 2020, about $4.50/share in profit.  Thats a PE of like 6.  Now no one thinks they will make that in '21.  2020 was the best mortgage year ever, people sat at home, watched netflix and bought and refinanced houses.  They also learned to use their phones and their computers for the first time ever.  They can now work and do businness on them, before they didn't, but covid make them overcome their fear and forced all the boomers to use their phone to get a mortgage.   the secular story of waiting for the apes who know how to use an app to move out of mom's basement to buy a house is over.  The boomers learned to use apps and now, all businesses will suceed or fail based on the quality of the app experience.  Did i mention RKTs apps are all number 1 or near in their catagories and great reveiws.  

Being number 1 and having great reviews in the app store makes it game over.  Its winner take all.  RKT will clean up in the down turn.  they will earn less with less business and higher rates but the long term earnings power of this company is $2-3/share and growing every downturn.

&#x200B;

2021-02-10 09:24:33,Amazon Doubles Down on Grocery,"Amazon is aggressively investing in the retail grocery business with the goal of operating 2,000 retail stores in the US blended between Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh. And so far they are killing it!

There are currently 500 Whole Foods stores and 8 Amazon Fresh stores in the US. Over 30 Whole Foods and 27 Amazon Fresh stores are currently in development.

Amazon recently opened the doors to its newest Amazon Fresh in Northridge, California. While the store marks the banner’s third location in SoCal (joining [Woodland Hills](https://www.winsightgrocerybusiness.com/retailers/how-amazon-fresh-won-my-business) and [Irvine](https://www.winsightgrocerybusiness.com/retailers/will-amazon-fresh-crush-it-california)), dozens of additional stores in various stages of development are also underway in the area. According to Planned Grocery, additional SoCal stores are planned or under construction in Poway, Whittier, Fullerton, Long Beach, La Verne and Encino. Additionally, four locations in the Chicago area are slated to open soon.

“Amazon seems to be putting the pedal to the metal with its grocery expansion plans,” R-5 Capital Analyst Scott Mushkin wrote. “In our view, it is hard not to see the recent partnership between Amazon and SpartanNash as a sign that Amazon intends to grow its store fleet rapidly over the next few years,” Mushkin said. According to the 2021 dunnhumby Retailer Preference Index, Amazon eclipsed top grocery retailers H-E-B and Trader Joe’s due to Speed, Digital and strong Price and Quality.

“H-E-B and Trader Joe’s are terrific brands, yet Amazon’s unmatched convenience is addictive,” wrote Ms. Goller. “The dunnhumby stats prove consumers crave prompt home delivery, a trend that will outlast the pandemic. Even when life resumes, Just Walk Out technology at Amazon Go and rivals’ stores will set new brick-and-mortar standards for convenience, ease and time savings. Also, I expect Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh will continue to expand nationwide when the time is right. Amazon’s hungry to win and its grocery party is just getting started.”

During United Natural Foods' recent earnings call, CEO Steven Spinner expects to renew its Whole Foods contract in early 2021. From their recent 10K filling, ""We have been the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market for more than twenty years. Under the terms of our agreement with Whole Foods Market, we serve as the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market in all of its regions in the United States. Our agreement with Whole Foods Market expires on September 28, 2025. Whole Foods Market is our only customer that represented more than 10% of total net sales in fiscal 2020."" Whole Foods accounted for approximately 18% of UNFI's net sales in fiscal 2020.

During Amazon's recent earnings call, Dave Fildes, director of investor relations, said the Amazon Go Grocery format was “off to a good start,” adding there was “a lot of interest” in the technology behind it and Amazon Fresh grocery stores.

Given the investments Amazon has made in the grocery business and the significant positive response thus far favorably positions Amazon and other grocery suppliers such as United Natural Foods (UNFI).

2020-06-28 11:25:39,"Macys: Buy the Rumor (M, AMZN)","*NOTE-6/5: As of this writing M is up 11.7%*

So, I feel like this is the definition of buy the rumor. Amazon has been hunting off and on for a suitable retail partner since 2017, when rumors first emerged of them buying out Kohl’s; Kohl’s even went so far as to initiate a unique deal with Amazon which allowed customers to conduct exchanges and other Amazon-exclusive transactions within their brick and mortar retail locations. For whatever reason that fell through, but in the same year (2017) Amazon started leasing six floors in Macy’s downtown Seattle building (which I’ve seen, it’s pretty dope); as mild as it may be, a relationship does exist there. The rumors about Macys and Amazon, picked up a little steam last week, and here’s why I think this deal could get done sooner rather than later.

Amazon Needs Real Estate, Which Macy’s Has

More retail real estate is something that been on Amazon’s radar for some time, and is a signifanct need in their battle for supremacy with WalMart, whose locations have given them an edge on both cost overheads and customer satisfaction. Consider this:

>The (M) real estate could be a strategic play for Amazon in its battle with Walmart for online dominance. Entrepreneur.com said **Walmart Inc** (NYSE: [WMT](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=WMT)) is able to deliver grocery items 20% cheaper than Amazon can because of its physical store locations. Walmart also allows in-store pickup for both grocery and non-grocery online orders, something Amazon can only offer at its Whole Foods and Amazon Go convenience locations.  
>  
>According to a November 2019 First Insight poll, 55% of people said they prefer to shop at Walmart versus Amazon, an increase of 8% from a similar 2018 poll. Those favoring Amazon dropped from 53% to 45%.

Macy’s own the vast majority of its stores and real estate, including *two* spaces in the Seattle area that Amazon leases from (they acquired small hub space in Redmond just a couple weeks ago). In order to gain the brick and mortar space they need, the acquisition makes sense.  But for this to make sense, Macy's would have to be put down....

**Macy’s was on it’s last leg, reopening pullbacks could be the nail in the coffin**

Macy’s—even before Covid--was struggling to compete in the e-commerce space. Once COVID blew through it was hit just as hard as other prominent brick and mortar retailers that have announced bankruptcy or significant financial sustainability issues (JCP, Kohl’s, Pier 1, on and on). *For the past quarter it reported an operating loss of $905 million to $1.11 billion, compared with net income of $203 million a year ago. They also announced on Thursday they would be cutting 3,900 corporate positions in a restructuring to survive COVID as a smaller, leaner company.*

Their last hope of getting back to where they once were was re-opening, and now that process looks troubled, at best.

**Why Macy’s and Not JCP**

JC Penney has been rumored to be approaching a buyout from Amazon—even going so far as acknowledging it was having talks with the tech giant. That was in early May, and they have since stalled. Macy’s has the relationship with Amazon expanding via their space leasing, and *JC Penney meanwhile has seemed to move on to acquisition talks with Sycamore Partners, and has actively been negotiating with landlords.* Talks of acquisition seemed to have cooled down by all available news sources.

**Why Macy's and Not Kohl's**

Though Kohl's and Macy's have had a partnership since 2017, it seems to not be working out as planned.  Found a few sources like this which intimate that the results have not been to Amazon's expectations ([https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/14/kohls-partnership-with-amazon-really-isnt-working.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/14/kohls-partnership-with-amazon-really-isnt-working.aspx) ) but I will admit that the partnership makes sense--it just hasn't happened for four years, so I feel it's less likely to be revived now.

**How you can win a couple different ways**

&#x200B;

1. *Macy’s may beat earnings expectations, anyway, and is poised for a rally even if it’s not bought outright*\- On June 9th Macy’s CEO Gennette stated that they were finding surprising success with reopening. Although it may be short-lived due to re-openings being halted, it could see a nice little bump for earnings on the 1st. Also of note, with JCP and other brick and mortar retailers filing for Bankruptcy en masse, they are in the hunt for some 10 billion dollars of market value up for grabs. It’s also down about 75% from it’s 53 week high, make it one of the few flagship companies still with plenty of room to run in the COVID recovery FOMO.
2. *If Amazon doesn’t do it, somebody will-* If Amazon rumors heat up, other vultures will begin circling the decimated department store. If Amazon falls through, look for other buyout companies to quickly step in with offers that Macy’s may have to accept since it’s weakness and willingness will be clear
3. *Amazon buys they asses and you print Whole Foods acquisition level tendies*

There’s no guarantee that Gennette is ready to sell, but given the current climate for all other major retailers, Amazon’s relationship with the company, and a potential second quasi-lockdown even further hurting their stores, it’d be surprising if Amazon didn’t take a swing at them, and even more surprising if Macy’s didn’t entertain talks in the near future.  If not with Amazon, then definitely with somebody else.

2020-07-26 05:44:44,AMZN Q2 earnings prediction,"So here is my forecast for AMZN earnings. I will look at each branch separately to address risks and chances.

E-commerce: I don’t need to stress the increased demand. While at the beginning AMZN had some problems and was apparently overwhelmed by the huge demand, they seemed to execute quite well since mid May. I have read Mastercard’s numbers for ecommerce sales saying that they have increased 50-70% yoy throughout these 3 months. Traffic on amazon.com every day during q2 was at an average of 60-65% of Prime Day and Cyber Monday which just gives us an impression on how well the e-commerce sector has probably performed. In addition to that, several international markets like Japan, India and Brazil have seen large increases that they normally don’t even see during their respective holiday seasons (using the google trends search tool). E.g. the market in India and Japan don’t produce elevated revenue during the q4 (the quarter amazon posts the highest revenue of the year), now however the revenue accelerated during q2. 
Regarding the US, despite the weaknesses in fulfilling demand, stimulus checks were certainly used for spending and therefore as social distancing and the convenience of online shopping became more popular fueled Amazon‘s revenue stream.
I expect a strong beat in the online-retail segment with the outlook being optimistic due to an increased shift of consumer behavior.

AWS: in the long term AWS surely benefits from COVID, as businesses tend to digitalize their infrastructure at an even higher pace. However, what Microsoft‘s Azure growth has shown us, is the fact that the investments into these kind of things have been postponed due to the uncertainty during this quarter. Microsoft’s Azure posted 47% revenue growth (50% without currency effects) that disappointed investors who were estimating 49%. On the other hand IBM‘s cloud segment beat estimates. So what’s the take for Amazon? I see the AWS segment as a possible negative surprise this quarter. They could slow like Azure to a sub 30% growth. They could also surprise positively with maintaining or increasing their growth, it’s a stab in the dark for me. This said, I believe the future, especially in the near term is bright for cloud overall.
So while the focus of the earnings report will surely be e-commerce investors might cherry-pick an AWS slow-down to take profits but I am not worried for this segment at all for the future.

Prime/subscriptions: I think that Amazon Prime combines different services that are all related and fitting into a stay-at-home-environment. It’s the free shipping service combined with its Prime Video Service and also Prime Music which make it a good offer during a pandemic. Also Twitch can benefit from this environment, so overall I‘m quite optimistic on the Media segment of Amazon.

Ad business: I’m taking out the ad business of the media business because I have read astonishing numbers about it: they seem to have increased ad revenue largely as there was a huge upside cycle: increases traffic (as I mentioned above) lead to increased ad revenue that lead to increased traffic and so on. Sources say they could have increased ad revenue by 60% which would be huge in a high profitable segment. 

tl;dr: Amazon will beat in the North America and international segment, will beat in the media and ad segment (I know they don’t list it that way but  I‘d like to stress the strengths of each segment). AWS will have a bright future, slowdown might be an excuse to take profits short term.

Jeff Bozo 4 president.

Edit: I forgot to address valuation. So of course they had a run up this year. But let’s take a closer look. They hit a high of $2170 pre-COVID after strong q4 2019 results. Now we are at $3000. That‘s not even an increase of 40%. The dramatic shift throughout all segments is immense and I think 40% is underestimating this. Don’t compare it to Tesla (they quadrupled or what?)...

Edit2: They will miss EPS probably but that just doesn’t matter this quarter. Bezos already said that they will invest 4bn or more, so nobody expects that much on the earnings side. The market will focus on revenue, and that’s where I see a huge beat to estimates of $80/81 bn.

Edit4: Lots of you say ”they already run up“. That’s not true if you compare: Since Apple and Amazon last reported earnings on 30 April, Apple went up 26%, Amazon ”only“ 21%. And it’s undebatable who‘s profiting more from the crisis.

2021-02-12 23:00:16,$TSLA is positioned for a massive reversal,"Tesla's current market cap is the result of multiple positive feedback loops which has pushed its price to a ludicrous level via Short + Gamma Squeezes (it is also important to note virtually all TSLA shorts are out^(1)). This campaign has been largely led by large hedge funds. Without S&P inclusion, the story might have ended there with hedge funds trying to escape with their profits and leaving retail the bag. However, S&P inclusion presented these hedge funds with a much better option to close out their positions while also riding the stock down. The shares that hedge funds no longer wanted began to be picked up by passive funds leading to selloffs by the active funds which pushed prices to this level.

With passive funds holding the bag, the hedge funds which lead the rally seem to be attempting to push the price back down through a reverse gamma squeeze^(2).

No retail trader is buying 1m+ in deep OTM puts, this is an attempt by hedgies to push the price down.

We can also see this from the massive shift in options volume. $190B of calls open interest and over $250B of puts open interest, a massive put skew. This is especially significant because ""To put it in context it is equal to the combined $AAPL and $AMZN bullish skew or if you’d rather to the combined  $BABA, $FB, $MSFT, $GOOG and $WMT combined."" reflecting extremely bearish sentiment in an very very bullish market.

Once the reversal begins there will be nothing stopping it as OTM puts get less and less OTM. There are no shorts left to be squeezed and the bag holding passive funds which are largely barred from holding derivatives will have no way of rebalancing the options skew.

**So, what is $UNFI and what do they do?**

UNFI is North America's largest publicly traded wholesale distributor. UNFI engages in the distribution of natural, organic, and specialty foods and non-food products. The firm operates through the following segments: Wholesale and Retail. The Wholesale segment is engaged in the national distribution of natural, organic, specialty, produce, and conventional grocery and non-food products, and providing retail services in the United States and Canada. The Retail segment derives revenues from the sale of groceries and other products at retail locations operated by companies. It offers food and non food, frozen, perishables, bulk, body care products and supplements. The company is the leading distributor and retailer services with 55 food distribution centers all located within 85% of the US/Canadian population. UNFI's close proximity to its customers drives significant cost advantages, as product transportation expenses (the costliest aspect of the food delivery business) are minimized, helping streamline operations and drive bottom line revenue growth. This provides UNFI with a competitive pricing advantage, as the company is able to deliver wholesale food items more quickly and at a better price than competitors.

With annual revenues exceeding $27 billion, UNFI is one of the [largest North American and Canadian food wholesalers](https://s22.q4cdn.com/589001886/files/doc_financials/2020/ar/UNITED-NATURAL-FOODS-INC._10K_2020_webready_V1.pdf) distributing more than 275,000 products to over 30,000 customer locations distributed across two continents. It displays distinct business advantages, including tremendous scale, operational efficiency, and substantial revenue diversification. UNFI's revenues are highly resistant to erosion or disruption. The company derives revenues from a vast array of customers across both wholesale and retail operating segments, helping to mitigate negative effects associated with losing any single customer. UNFI has been the primary distributor to Whole Foods Markets for more than 20 years and has developed entrenched competition-resistant relationships with quite a number of widely recognized food retailers ranging from Whole Foods ([AMZN](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN)), Kroger ([KR](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KR)), Sprouts ([SFM](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SFM)), Wegmans, Harris Teeter, Cash and Carry Stores, The Fresh Market, Coborn’s, Natural Grocers, and Jerry’s Foods, among others. UNFI only has one main competitor, SpartanNash Other preeminent food distribution companies Sysco ([SYY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SYY?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) and US Foods ([USFD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USFD?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) service a different demographic targeting restaurants, schools, businesses, hospitals, etc., whereas UNFI focuses on supermarkets and food retailers in both the wholesale and retail operating segments.

**Wait?**

So am I really pushing a grocery stock when there are sexier investment opportunities like PLTR? That’s right, I am. And it sure is an unsexy boomer stock, but it’s also a huuuuuge value investment right now and with the market being as saturated as it is when a lot of companies seem to have world domination priced in it sure feels nice parking my money in a stock that’s both undervalued and defensive against a market crash or inflation. We all gotta eat right?

**COVID-19 AND UNFI**

Amidst lockdowns and a national pandemic, UNFI demonstrated strong performance in 2020. It reported sales growth across all channels; chains sales increased 21% to $10.7 billion, independent retailers' sales increased 21% to $6.7 billion, supernatural sales increased 7.4% to $4.7 billion, and retail sales increased 41.0% to $1.7 million. The company has witnessed consistent revenue expansion for more than 20 years, experiencing high mid-single digit growth for many years. Its underlying food business is highly recession-resistant with stable revenue prospects over the long term. Money traditionally spent in restaurants, at schools, near workplaces, at bars, etc. is being redirected toward grocery spending. [Some estimates](https://www.qsrmagazine.com/consumer-trends/restaurants-down-200-billion-already-prepare-election-fallout) indicate that the restaurant industry has lost upwards of $200 billion as a result of the pandemic. Although devastating to restaurant businesses, the money lost will be redirected toward the retail grocery segment.

**Some boring financial oversight**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5ag5m6zzatl61.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=d903680d629c55b7d157df6c0785155648da8fbe

According to its [latest quarterly earnings release](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/18115573-united-natural-foods-inc-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-2021-results?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link), UNFI expects to reduce net debt to $2.44 billion by the end of FY 07/2021, excluding any proceeds from potential divestitures. During the last earnings call, management said they expect to achieve net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage of approximately 3.5 times by July 2021. In comparison, the leverage ratio was 5.5x at the end of October 2019. An examination of UNFI's financials reveals very strong performance on the company's income statement, steady revenue expansion, net sales up nearly 20% from last year alone, and that revenues have increased for 20 years. What could happen after the company has managed to achieve a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 2.0 to 2.5? Firstly, the board could distribute dividends or launch a share buyback program.

Going forward, UNFI as a pure-play distributor should be able to throw off free cash of $300 million on a yearly basis. Taking into account management's self-declared ongoing focus on reducing costs, expanding margins and increasing free cash flows, as well as lower interest payments resulting from debt reductions, the number of $300 million could eventually evolve into $350 million over the long term if everything goes well.

With a market capitalization of $895 million, future free cash flows of $330 million a year as estimated by analysts, management's expectation of net debt falling to $2.4 billion by the end of FY 07/2021 and a short interest of 23 percent, the S&P SmallCap 600 member may be an excellent value play.

* **Highlights (comparisons to first quarter fiscal 2020):**

• Net Sales increased 6.0% to $6.67 billion

• Net loss of $1 million, including $43 million in pre-tax charges and costs

• Adjusted EBITDA increased 30.6% to $159 million

• Loss per diluted share of $0.02, reflective of charges and costs

• Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased by $0.47 to $0.51

• Prior guidance affirmed for net sales, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS

**Recent deals:**

As of March 04 UNFI have extended it’s deal on being Whole Foods supplier until 2027. Amazon's online grocery sales are increasing at a rapid rate with a CAGR of 9%, with 2021 grocery sales expected to reach $23 billion. UNFI will benefit from enduring tailwinds originating from the Amazon and Whole Foods operating segments long into the future. This deal serves as a huge catalyst and has long been a big “beware sign” for investors, now when the deal is inked we will probably see more investors coming in when the big will they won't they question have been answered. The stock saw a rise of 6% on thursday when the deal was announced and a volume of about 3.3, about 2x average which seems… low considering how large of a deal it is.

&#x200B;

**The OMG is Whole foods leaving UNFI scare 2018:**

Strategically it wouldn't make financial sense for Amazon to invest tens of billions of dollars to set up another 40+ distribution facilities especially for food items and acquire fleets of delivery vehicles, all in order to generate a low-single digit return on investment. But it was a big concern for investors. While many shareholders have been criticizing management for paying $2.9 billion to take control of competitor Supervalu back in 2018. Strategically, the acquisition was a very smart move. The deal was simply necessary to lessen UNFI's reliance on customer Whole Foods Market. Before the acquisition, Whole Foods Market [accounted for 37 percent](https://s22.q4cdn.com/589001886/files/doc_financials/quaterly_reports/2018/UNFI-Supervalu-Acquisition-Update-Final-09.20.18-Updated-09.27.18.pdf) of UNFI's revenues. Now the customer's share of sales is [down to 18 percent](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4376752-united-natural-foods-inc-2020-q4-results-earnings-call-presentation?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link). In fact, during the [last quarterly earnings call](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4393912-united-natural-foods-inc-unfi-ceo-steven-spinner-on-q1-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) we learned that UNFI exceeded its four-year target of $185 million in synergies in just two years. On top of that, free cash flow reached [a record of $284 million](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/18022422-united-natural-foods-inc-reports-record-fourth-quarter-and-strong-full-year-fiscal-2020?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) in FY 07/2020. It just seems that management has more possibilities to optimize the economics and fundamentals of the business, thanks to the acquisition of Supervalu.

**Key Food:**

UNFI recently signed a deal with Key Food and now serves as the primary grocery wholesaler to Key Food with expected sales to UNFI of approximately $10 billion over 10 years. Key Food, whose members operate more than 315 stores, is a rapidly growing organization with a large market share in the New York market

**Some strong financials to take notice of:**

* The stock carries a very low forward P/FCF ratio of just 2.7, providing ample upside potential.
* According to SharePad there are currently 1192 publicly traded companies on a US stock exchange that generates revenues of $1.5B and have a market capitalization of at least $100m. Banks, insurers, and real estate companies are excluded from this custom screen. FCF estimates are not available for 145 on that list. ***Interestingly, out of the 1,047 stocks, only 23 carry a forward P/FCF multiple of between 0 and 3. United Natural Foods is one of them.***
* unless UNFI needs a huge capital increase or goes bankrupt, it's hard to imagine the stock will continue to hover at unusually low valuation levels.
* Return vs Industry: UNFI exceeded the US Consumer Retailing industry which returned 9.1% over the past year.
* Return vs Market: UNFI exceeded the US Market which returned 36.3% over the past year.
* PB vs Industry: UNFI is good value based on its PB Ratio (1.3x) compared to the US Consumer Retailing industry average (2.8x).
* Under the hood there's retail that should sell for \~$700m and another \~$2B of real estate,
* United Natural Foods continues to benefit from the pandemic, providing excess cash flows in the near term which allows for a modest reduction in debt.
* current PE ratio of about 13 and expected to go even lower as they keep reporting pandemic earnings.
* Using those earnings to pay off debt way ahead of schedule and strengthening their financial position further.
* Benefits from a low intrest rate from the federal reserve in regards to their debt
* Benefits from COVID-19

**DEBT**

There is always some inherent risk involved in every trade and I feel like only presenting the bull case is very misleading. The biggest bear argument for UNFI is their debt for sure, so let’s go through it.

UNFI does exhibit some vulnerabilities in its balance sheet - the company has a debt load of $2.6 billion and a moderate debt-to-equity ratio of 2:1, and debt is covered by operating cash flow at roughly 20% coverage; however, UNFI does lack substantial liquidity reserves, displaying just $49 million in available liquidity.

&#x200B;

Although: (***NOTE: This segment is from a calculation made in jaunary and it's only purpose is to give you an impression of the legroom UNFI has, I'm a lazy fuck so i won't update this to reflect todays values***) From a valuation standpoint, UNFI is undervalued by any means of analysis: P/E, PEG, PB, or discounted cash flow; the stock is trading at a P/E ratio of 6.7x earnings and is drastically undervalued. Based on a [discounted cash flow analysis](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-ms/morgan-stanley#dividend), the current share price of $15.58 is way below the future cash flow value of $86.01, implying that the stock is undervalued by 82%.

United Natural Foods continues to benefit from the pandemic, providing excess cash flows in the near term which allows for a modest reduction in debt At the end of 2019, UNFI's long-term debt stood at $3.05 billion while net income was negative by a very slim margin relative to their massive revenue. By the end of 2020, the long-term debt had been reduced to $2.6 billion- a reduction of 17.3% across only 4 quarters. Quickly paying down this debt has been drastically reducing interest payments on it, and combined with macro-level tailwinds, this has seen Y/Y net income more than triple, from $101 million in 2019 to $306 million in 2020. In early 2021, UNFI announced that the interest on their senior debt moving forward had been reduced from 4.25% to 3.5%. This debt has also allowed UNFI to increase total revenue from $8.47 billion in 2016 to $26 billion in 2020, while at the same time improving both gross and net margin. Looking at UNFI's balance sheet, you could understand how this company could be undervalued, but by digging a little deeper, you can see that this debt is not dead weight, but has been put to work effectively. Debt has been a problem for UNFI ever since the Supervalu acquisition. However, UNFI is beginning to turn a corner as the company is generating healthier profits and margins amid the pandemic, which allows them to accelerate debt payments. UNFI also has a substantial amount of real estate (between $1B to $2B) that it could sell within the next few years and pay off even more debt. Recently UNFI repriced senior secured term loan facility, which reduced its interest rate by 50 to 75 basis points on $1.8B due in 2026. Which saves the company 9-13 mil and shows the debt profile is improving with lenders.

&#x200B;

A bear case for UNFI’s debt situation is that when this pandemic is over people are going to visit restaurants a lot which will decrease their revenue. UNFI is not a player in supplies to restaurants.

**Short Interest:**

Now this is probably where a lot of you guys lose interest and a lot of you guys gain interest. UNFI has a significant of it’s shares shorted about 12,4 mil out of it’s outstanding 56,14 mil. It’s by no means even close to $GME’s amount of shorted shares, but it’s a lot still. Even more so when you consider that the public float is around 5-6mil and daily volume about 1,6m. Now there is no shortage of shares to borrow according to iborrowdesk and the fee is low.

If shorts were to be trapped however it would take them about 7 days to close their position based on daily volume. There probably won’t be a short squeeze, but there is a chance. What makes a high short interest attractive is that when they are wrong it creates a lot of upwards momentum and boy are they wrong about this one lol. Short sellers are at significant risk of blowing-up with \~22% of the float short and with the total dollars short up an extraordinary 444% since February of 2020. To put this into perspective, the total dollars short (a figure that Ihors Dusaniwsky of S3 typically cites as the most important in determining the risk to short sellers) was $332M compared to $61M in February of 2020. Basically they are bleeding. They can easily short the stock more to suppress the price but the writing have been on the wall for some time and while it might just be a slow rush they are only delaying the inevitable.

The biggest risk to UNFI was previously a failure to extend the Whole Foods contract. But since it isn’t anymore and earnings will be boom-diggitey shorts are probably weighing their options now.

**Who is shorting this stock?**

Seems like a stupid stock to short at this day and age. The shorts are due to a dispute between UNFI and Goldman Sachs and seems petty to me, UNFI lost on a technicality. Here’s an old headline.

“United Natural Foods, Inc. Files Lawsuit Against Goldman Sachs and Related Parties. Lawsuit Details How Goldman Sachs Systematically Deceived, Exploited and Threatened UNFI While Advising the Company on its Acquisition of SUPERVALU”

**Catalysts**

Because every dynamite needs a fuse:

* New CEO Replacement – last year confirmed that current CEO will be retiring in July 2021 and a new CEO will be announced early 2021
* March 10 earnings
* Share buyback (highly unlikely in the near term)
* the sale of the retail grocery business (Cubs and Shoppers) as well as the sale of other assets that were acquired through the Supervalu acquisition.
* Hook another big customer/Being bought up by Amazon or acquire the business of amazon fresh (this is highly speculative and basically an x factor)
* New contract with Whole Foods. (Which just happend, Heres a quote from domo capital: “DOMO Capital believes that shares of UNFI will be valued at over $100 per share within the next 3 years. We believe that the bulk of these gains will be realized upon the finalization of the Whole Foods contract extension and the sale of the retail operations and other assets”

Curious rise in options activity on wednesday march 3. Volume spike up to 5506 march 19 contracts. 550,600 underlying shares, 66% of unfis moving average. Especially high volume for march 19 35$ strike. This is the current option chain. Seems like some calls have been exercised.

Recent uptick in volume. Volume have been low between feb 4 - march 3. Volume spike after Whole Foods news. (doesn't seem to be priced in, only up 6% on the news.) UNFI closed up 5.35 percent on Friday, March 5, 2021, on 1.3 times normal volume.

\^Top (daily): [UNFI ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-UNFI/)makes big gains in a very short amount of time with 2 +100% gains in under a week since the March 2020 low

Bottom (weekly): not only does [UNFI ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-UNFI/)go on explosive runs, but the next run could take the stock above a 6 year long downtrend. With the stock working into the apex of a [descending triangle](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/descendingtriangle/) , I have to think a big move is coming soon.

The stock lies in the lower part of a very wide and strong rising trend in the short term, and this may normally pose a very good buying opportunity. If the lower trend floor at $29.91 is broken, it will firstly indicate a slower rate of rising, but may also be an early warning for a trend shift. Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise 73.11% during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between $51.77 and $66.92 at the end of this 3-month period.

That’s pretty much it. But some things to consider:

Stock price might drop after earnings as they often do due to shorting or sell off.

Been debating myself if i should get out and get back in after earnings, but as off now i think i’m just going to let my shares ride.

**Position: 3200 shares at 30.50**.

2021-02-15 14:53:52,"RKT DD Part II: A former employee's take on Rocket's Culture and how it will allow them to become the ""Amazon of financial services.""","**\*Disclaimer\*** this is a 15-minute read. I’ve seen a lot of posts on Rocket, but no posts focus on their culture. A lot of posts explain ***what*** they're doing, but this one will explain ***how*** they're doing it.

In RKT DD Part One, I discuss why and how RKT is being manipulated by institutions by way of shorting and by manufacturing negative narratives in effort to accumulate more shares for cheap. *Refer to RKT DD Part 1 Below:*

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfsacx/but\_analysts\_say\_rkt\_isnt\_a\_buy\_no\_shit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfsacx/but_analysts_say_rkt_isnt_a_buy_no_shit/)

In RKT DD part II, I will discuss the single reason I have such an oversized position in RKT.

The single reason my bullishness and conviction has not wavered since IPO is because of Rocket’s **company culture** – which I was lucky to witness firsthand while working at Rocket from 2013 to 2015. Based on my experience, Rocket’s culture is the reason no insider selling took place following their lock-up expiration period on Feb. 2. Rocket employees, especially their executives, don’t view Rocket as just a company. They view Rocket almost as a religion, which shapes their belief system and influences how they work and live.

In a 2017 Harvard Business Review article, the author discusses how effective cultures oftentimes require shocking rules in order to produce shocking results. The first two companies he discusses are none other than AMZN and RKT. After living Rocket’s culture and researching Amazon’s – it is astonishing how similar both cultures are. *Article Link Below:*

[https://hbr.org/2019/12/to-build-a-strong-culture-create-rules-that-are-unique-to-your-company](https://hbr.org/2019/12/to-build-a-strong-culture-create-rules-that-are-unique-to-your-company)

Both AMZN and RKT are not defined by what they do, but rather who they are. Amazon’s culture is what allows them to be in various industries all while maintaining their identity. Culture is the glue that unifies every part of Amazon’s diverse business together. Culture is the same unifying factor that allows Rocket Founder, Dan Gilbert to own and operate over 100 companies (15 of which are under $RKT).

# Introduction to RKT’s “ISMs” and “ISMs Day”

Rocket’s culture is based around 20 “ISMs” (aka philosophies) which serve as guiding principles. I will admit that these principles are obvious, and many companies likely have similar ones. But companies’ values are meaningless unless they are embedded into the company’s day-to-day norms.

Gilbert indoctrinates new hires by devoting 8 hours every three weeks to host **“ISMs day.”** ISMs day is a day-long seminar hosted by Dan Gilbert and Jay Farner for new employees to help them understand the deeper meaning of Rocket’s core values. Gilbert spends the entire day explaining how these values allowed him to transform himself from a pizza delivery boy to the owner of an empire with a net worth of $50B. They even hand out an ISMs books which are essentially corporate bibles. I kid you not, if you make a mistake at work, some directors will make you read out of the ISMs book as if you were repenting for your Anti-ISM sins.

As a former United States Army captain, I can tell you that Rocket’s first 4 months of indoctrination was almost as effective as the Army’s 11-week Basic Combat Training course held at Ft. Benning, GA. Dan Gilbert understands psych 101 and how to effectively use it to produce his army of soldiers.

# “Every Client, Every Time - No Exception, No Excuses”

Like AMZN, standards are very high at RKT, especially when it comes to customer service. If it is discovered that an employee failed to reply to a customer’s email or phone call on the same day, then they will receive a “no return call complaint” (NRCC). No matter if you’ve been with the company for 15 years or 15 days – if you get three NRCCs, then you are automatically fired, on the spot, “…no exceptions, no excuses.”

My most memorable moment of **“every client every time no exception no excuses”** was when I failed to call back a customer who did not qualify for a mortgage. The denied customer called the hotline in search of his banker (me). Three hours after he was routed to my phone, I got an email from former Rocket Companies CEO Bill Emerson inquiring on the incident – he even CC’d Dan Gilbert. **That’s right boys and girls, I was on the same email chain as Uncle Dan himself, getting bitched at by the former CEO of RKT** (The former CEO would run circles around Jay Farner).

The former CEO didn’t go through the president of mortgage banking who would then go through the regional vice president, who would then go through my director and then to me – he cut out all the bureaucratic layers to discover why I failed on one of their guiding principles. *(Rocket HATES red-tape bureaucratic layers; it is not in line with their culture and they prefer a flat hierarchy).* The RKT CEO even had a 5-minute call with my director as a follow up. CEO Bill Emerson dropped everything he was doing because nothing was more important than one of Rocket’s guiding principles: **“every client, every time, no exceptions, no excuses.”**

&#x200B;

# “It’s Not About Who Is Right, But What Is Right”

All individuals within Rocket Companies are held to the same standards defined by the company’s ISMs. It doesn’t matter if you are a lowly janitor or a Regional Vice President with a corner office view. Dan Gilbert formed a flat hierarchy reflected in another ISM, **“It’s not who is right, but what is right.”** I have witnessed a Regional Vice President of Mortgage Banking get double demoted to a banker solely because he started to arrive 20 minutes late to work every other day, for a few weeks in a row. Those 20 minutes are a big deal because at Rocket **“Every Second Counts” (another ISM).**

During my first ISMs day, Gilbert and former CEO Bill Emerson further proved they were a flat hierarchy when they gave their personal cell phones to the audience of hundreds of newly hired employees. Dan did this to drive home the importance of customer service within Rocket’s culture.

*“if you guys ever get too busy to return a customer’s phone call – let either of us know and we will call them for you,”* said Gilbert.

Of course, no one was stupid enough to do this, but we knew it was meant to drive home their message on **customer focus**.

I witnessed many employees let go for little things like this. It served as a reminder that either you lived the ISMs or you left the company. Leadership understood toxic attitudes were contagious, so they would quickly remove the cancer before it could spread to other teammates. If you quit the company and tried to give them your two weeks, they would decline and then show you the door. I am talking The Office, Michael Scott to Toby style exit.

# “Ignore the Noise”

ISMs exerted such a strong force on me, that even my parents and friends accused Rocket of being a cult – but instead of listening to them, I would **“Ignore the noise,”** which is an ISM that means, ignore the “naysayers” and never let them stop you from success. There will always be noise in our lives – but the truly successful are able to ignore it and complete the task ahead.

I was legitimately offended when people accused Rocket of being a cult. They didn’t understand that hard work and hustle was required for the finer things in life. Rocket made us proud of the work ethic it instilled, so we took it personal when an outsider insulted the empire Dan had built. The same empire that is now single handedly saving the City of Detroit. We didn’t understand why people would bad-mouth a company who gave young, non-college educated kids the chance to make $20,000 a month in exchange for hard work. RKT strategically empowered those who were never empowered, in exchange for their utmost loyalty and devotion to the company (more on that later).

I also remember when **“ignore the noise”** was used against me. I complained to a co-worker about working another Saturday and instead of agreeing with me, he looked at me with an almost robot-like stare and said, “**ignore the noise,** man.” Rocket had programmed him; he wanted no part in speaking ill toward the company that shaped his belief system.

# “We Are The They”

Rocket was able to create a culture so strong that the employees within Rocket looked at the company as an extension of themselves. Any negative remark against the company, was a negative remark against the individual employee, which is why I took it personal when people accused Rocket of being a cult. **“We are the they”** was an effective ISM designed to unify the individuals within Rocket as one. **“We are the they”** means that there is no “they.” The “they” is all of us. “**We Are The They”**: One team. United. All in the mission together.

# Action-oriented ISMs (i.e. “Innovation is rewarded but execution is worshipped,” “we’ll figure it out,” “Every Second Counts”)

Rocket’s ISMs are a roadmap designed to destroy the conventional bureaucratic BS that is so common in legacy companies like General Motors or IBM. Don’t you hate when you have hour long meeting at work and by the end, no decision was ever made? Rocket loves ideas. Employees can even email Dan Gilbert directly (flat hierarchy) when you have an idea. But Rocket places more emphasis on action out lined in ISMs above. At Rocket they realize you cannot cross every “t” and dot every “I” before launching a new innovative idea. If you did, progress would never be made – they emphasized that employees **“figure it out”** by doing and trusting the idea and refining along the way. A crucial step in acquiring and growing separate businesses and ideas.

It’s not just the customer-facing bankers that carry the ethos. Every. Single. Person. in the company, responds with a sense of urgency.

Now you “naysayers” might be asking how do I know if Rocket’s culture still is this way and that it extends to every part of the company. I left Rocket in 2015, and I am now a supplier for them. I deal with their facility management department and they are just as on the ball as their customer-facing bank force. They respond to my emails the quickest, out of any of my 400 customers. It is apparent that their culture runs deep and extends throughout the entire company, not just their sales team.

What happens if you are not on the ball? Simple: you are fired. This company is on the **lunatic fringe** of perfection. The same amount of perfection that Amazon demands, which is outlined in one of Amazon’s 14 leadership principles “Insist on the Highest Standards.”

# Who Does Rocket Hire and why?

Rocket hires anyone and everyone. Gilbert also strategically hires underdogs. He doesn’t care if you have a college degree, high school degree or neither – he hires almost anyone to see if they fit into the culture he created. If not, they are fired at a moment’s notice.

His way of hiring non-college educated kids, who somewhat embody Detroit, is genius. The non-college educated, young 20-year old’s are given a second chance: a chance to make easily over 6-figures. Keep in mind that these are kids who worked jobs such as bartenders or waitresses before Rocket took a chance on them.

Non-college educated employees typically promote faster than the college educated ones.

Why? Because these employees understand that no other company will compensate them the way Rocket does. Rocket empowers those who have never been empowered in exchange for their full devotion to the company and its philosophies. They are the ambassadors of Dan’s ISMs.

# How have these ISMs changed me and Detroit?

These ISMs not only transformed me into a more effective employee, but equally they transformed me into a very entitled customer when I was outside of work. Whenever I got bad service, I would become irritated. Rocket had programmed me on how service was supposed to be and that anything short of perfection was unacceptable. I didn’t realize how truly special and impactful Rocket’s culture was until I left and worked for another fortune 500 company. Its true: leaders either create a culture, or the culture will create itself.

Rocket also used the location of its headquarters as a symbol of hard work and resiliency. In 2010, at the height of the recession, Detroit’s unemployment was 3x the national average. Nothing was in downtown Detroit at the time. Detroit went from the richest city in the world in the 1950s to the symbol of tragedy at the beginning of the 21st century. When companies were leaving Detroit during the height of the recession, Dan Gilbert was going against the traffic and moving his entire team from Livonia, Michigan to the heart of downtown Detroit.

I can’t explain to you the difference Dan Gilbert has made in downtown Detroit. Everyone laughed at Dan’s decision to move Rocket Companies to downtown Detroit – but Dan followed two ISMs **“Yes before no”** and **“you have to believe it to see it.”**

They doubted Dan’s ability to revitalize downtown Detroit just as they doubted his ability to issue mortgage loans virtually on the internet in the 1990s, just as they doubted his idea to perform the mortgage process on only an app, with no loan officer, in 2015. The same way they doubted Gilbert could win an NBA championship with one of the worst sports teams in the league (do you notice a trend?)

The same way they doubt Dan Gilbert will be able to f\*\*ck the shorts who are driving down his stock.

They’re also now laughing at Dan’s vision to turn Detroit into the fintech hub of the world. But Dan follows **“you have to believe it, to see it”** to the T. And his bold actions inspire his army of soldiers who wear the Rocket badge around their neck.

Following the 2010 move, Detroit has become Rocket’s symbol – it has totally transformed the company and its employees to have an underdog mentality with the hunger to prove itself.

The character of the city — its grit, resilience, and fortitude — gave the company mythology for the brand and its founder. This has been a part of the storytelling mechanism by which Rocket evangelizes itself to the market…both locally and beyond; and it’s quite powerful.

# Why is Rocket’s Culture important?

Rocket is more than a company; it is a belief system that unites 20,000 employees to a common goal. This belief system allows for many strangers to cooperate effectively – just as the belief system of religion connects millions across the globe.

Culture isn’t about what gets done, but how it gets done. Rocket’s belief system can apply to any industry, not just mortgages. That’s why Gilbert pounds into his employee’s heads:

*“it’s not what we do, it’s who we are that defines us.”*

It’s why Gilbert went public: he wants to compete with silicon valley and incentivize software programmers to join his religion by offering stock options. He wants to use RKT stock as currency to acquire other fintech companies and have them adopt his unifying culture which has brought him to where he is today.

It’s why he owns all the historic buildings in the heart of downtown Detroit. Yes, there's a part of this that is about community and altruism, but it is also about business. It would be much harder for RKT to capitalize on it’s business plan to create the Amazon of financial services if their companies were spread out across different suburbs. By owning the majority of Downtown Detroit (which he does), Rocket is able to capitalize on talent and the millennial trend to work in urban cores all while creating a synergistic energy among Rocket’s multiple companies which will further revitalize Detroit in the process.

I see why those looking from the outside in think that Rocket is just a mortgage company. But those that work there understand mortgages are just the start of Rocket’s empire. Trust me, but as Dan Gilbert would say, you have to **“believe it, to see it.**

Gilbert's empire is just getting started.

Guys, thanks for all the love on that. Continuing...

We have to understand the bond market or at least have a general idea of what it is. So, no bear scenarios just yet.

**Treasury Bills, Notes, Bonds.**

Just what the hell are they? Give it to me like I’m 8.

They are literally a way for the government to raise capital to use in projects like Covid relief. Not only for negative scenarios but for good ones also, like infrastructure.

**Why different names?**

Treasury Bills: Short term maturity date. Year or less.

Treasury Notes: Mid term maturity date. 2 to 10 years.

Treasury Bonds: Long term maturity date. 10+ to 30 years. Fun fact. They actually thought about issuing 100 year bonds back in 2019. LOL?

**Why they are SOOO important?**

I can’t stress enough how important they are. They're as important as your paycheck to you. On a government scale.

US Bond market is twice as big than the stock market and it trades at a higher volume. Daily. Mostly, investment banks buys them via auctions and offers them to their clients around the world in secondary markets.

I wanna invest in government backed bonds too! You can do that by buying ETFs through ticker symbols like TLT, SHY, SHV etc.

I don’t know why you’d wanna do that but okay. For instance, SHY moved 6 bucks in 15 years 🙄 It wouldn’t make sense for you and I to buy bonds. However, if you have billions of dollars sitting around that 10YR 1.6% yield we’re gonna talk about brings tens of millions backed by ‘Murica. Hell yeah!

**The infamous 10 YEAR TREASURY NOTE YIELD.**

Keeping it simple, not going into Coupon Yields. It’s the interest rate the government pays when it borrows money. Just like your credit card. You use the card, Chase charges you interest.

In our most glorious decade (1990-2000) 10 year treasury yield traded between 5 to 7% compared to 1.6% last Friday. WTF? Yields going up is a good thing for long term economy. They're going up, so what the hell is the problem? Problem is not that they’re going up, it’s how fast they’re going up.

When yields decline, money flows into other equities like stock market with the hopes of better return of investment. Now, when life is normal, this flow or outflow isn’t visible in short term, because yields don’t go up or down drastically in matter of weeks. Until recently.

Putting it in perspective. Here’s an aha moment for you. You keep hearing TSLA stock price is overvalued, P/E ratio at 140x hurrr...durrrr...That’s because money got poured into growth stocks like TSLA and AMZN the last decade due to declining yields. What sector is the most promising in terms of future growth? Tech. When yields spiked in matter of weeks, tech took a big shit. Because it was the most “leveraged” sector. Just look at this goddam chart. It’s crazy.

My apologies for not delivering **Bear Scenarios** tonight. I am six beers into a beautiful Sunday weather and I'd like to take my time making a solid bear case. We've at least established how important bond market is and how it controls the entire economy. It'd make a good case when SPY hits 400 in about 18 hours. Oh by the way, I think 10 Year Treasury bond will get close to 3% by Christmas and shit's gonna hit the fan. Cheers.",374,0.94

2021-02-23 11:25:24,Crowd sourcing DD: There is a MASSIVE payment card data breach going on,"**TL;DR:**

**1. Check all of your credit and debit cards for fraudulent charges. There are reports of a tidal wave of fraudulent charges across different banks and payment networks.**

**2. Let's get to the bottom of this and buy the puts that will send us to Valhalla. Currently, there is no mainstream reporting of these fraud charges. I have puts on BBVA, FIS, and FISV**

Again, check all of your debit cards and credit cards for unauthorized transactions. Some of the more common ones are ""coloadtest,"" ""Angela Singleton,"" Spotify, ""sumup,"" ""wfxb,"" and ""amzn\[.\]com."" Report the transactions as fraudulent so that your card gets locked instead of simply disputing the charge.

# Tidal wave of fraud charges

In the links below, you will find pages of people reporting small and large fraudulent transactions.  I've read 300+ comments of affected people. Many of them note that customer service has told them that a lot of other people are disputing similar fraud charges. Moreover, these charges are bizarre in their diversity of payment networks, banks, and ""workarounds"" that they use. E.g. Some fraudulent charges are on prepaid gift cards. Some fraudulent charges are on cards that were cancelled, re-sent, and fraudulently charged while still in the mail. Some fraudulent charges posted to cards that were closed (possibly by manipulating a recurring charge mechanism). Below are links to some of the data points, I broke the links because my previous submissions were autospammed, sorry. There is also a table below where I summarized some of the data before I got tired of data entry.

Collaborator [u/Wise\_Hope\_3654](https://www.reddit.com/u/Wise_Hope_3654/) made this spreadsheet for the Reddit data points: megaDOTnz/file/bggQxARK#haADas8e1JTmMKufpzXWM6RgHn7fR3I-d27Ec4nrYPg

&#x200B;

To summarize the table, almost all major credit card issuing banks and almost all major credit card payment networks have been hit. Mastercard has been maybe less affected. Some cards have only been used once. One card was never used. Some cards were gift cards. Some cards were cancelled and then charged when a new card was sent but before it was received in the mail.

One of the most interesting leads is the commenter who said this data is being shared on the dark web and he got that from a source called idx (I have no idea what that is).

**Inferences:**

1. This was probably not an attack on a retailer's database because many cards were only used once.
2. This was probably not an attack on issuing banks since so many were affected. One possible exception is BBVA, since their cards were the victims of the earliest attacks and have been attacked in relatively large quantity.
3. Likewise, Amex and Visa are more sus than other payment networks, but still not high on the list of suspects.
4. Some agent that many banks and payment networks use is the most likely culprit. This could be a software vendor. It could be a faulty pipeline to a credit report company (TransUnion, Equifax, Experian) that is adding payment info.
5. This breach is deep in the system if they are able to hit cards that are ostensibly locked and that are being sent in the mail after the first is cancelled.
6. Likewise, this is probably not a stale breach from long ago since the fraudsters are able to update their card info to these newly mailed cards.
7. Many are reporting the same fraudulent charges e.g. coloadtest, Angela Singleton, cfxb, and sumup, so we know these are part of the same breach or set of breaches by the same hacker.
8. The sumup charges are being sent to Brazil. That's a good place for international financial crimes since Brazil does not extradite citizens.

# Suspicions

I think the most likely source of the quantity and variety of breached cards is a deep attack on a ""acquirer processor."" An acquirer is the bank that handles the transaction for the merchant. Merchant acquirers are the banks that handle transaction risk. Acquirer processors actually process the transactions. Some banks do both, for example, Chase (JPM). Some banks do not, for example Wells Fargo (WFC), hands off the processing to Fiserv (FISV).

A processor is the most likely to be able to generate the kind of data needed for this attack. They would see data from across many banks and payment networks. They would have the ability to collect new card data after reissues and data from cards that were never used. In the 2011 hack of FIS, the hackers were able to get into prepaid debit card (vanilla gift card) data. That hack led to a sustained 35% downturn in the FIS stock price; I suspect a similar breach will do the same.

krebsonsecurityDOTcom/2013/06/fdic-2011-fis-breach-worse-than-reported/

I collected data below from people who only ever used their card at a very small number of retailers to get a sense of which acquirer processor is most likely to have been hacked, The data is unfortunately not very conclusive.

https://preview.redd.it/65ya90kc2aj61.png?width=2281&format=png&auto=webp&s=51aadd82f159f196b5ccc483901f4878abcec3b3

There's also a possibility that there were multiple breaches and these attacks are being mixed to obscure the origin.

**I'm hoping some of you know more about the innards of the payment network system or legacy software that banks use to support it. I'm hoping that we can put together a case for a most likely suspect company and make a killing with our early DD.**

My second DD will be devoted to RKT's shocking rules and their one-of-a-kind culture. RKT DD Part III will focus on Rocket's vision to make Detroit the fintech capital of the world by doing much more than just writing loans.

When in reality, RKT is a gold mine and the fat cat tutes know it.

RKT DD Part 1 will explain the market manipulation RKT is experiencing, how it works, who is doing it and why they are doing it. I will also discuss another successful company that experienced this in 2012 and how I believe RKT will have a similar outcome as the company I mention.

Use this information as you wish - do your own DD or analysis at all times before making any decisions that might impact your trading account. 

**AMZN key points**

* 3,250 rejection for four times in the past couple of weeks, but wit smaller intervals. This means that the 3,250 level triggers sellers, but since the interval is getting smaller, there are less and less sellers left. This is a good set-up for a breakout (hence the buyers take over) 
* MACD on the daily turning bullish

I am opening a position once 3,250 breaks and AMZN manages to stay above that 3,250 level. Target is 3,344 (previous ATH). When that holds, I expect 3,400 as a next level.

AMZN 3400C 8/21 was $19.40 Friday at close. When today is the day AMZN breaks $3,250, it would be priced at \~$35 (however, IV might increase as well) 

Another, higher risk option, is AMZN 3350C 8/14, priced at $10.35 Friday at close. This one would be priced \~$25 when AMZN breaks 3,250 today.

2021-03-09 20:25:31,SNDL Casual Analysis 🌱,"I bought SNDL in May at $0.60 next day it went to $1.50 and came back down to $0.50 and I was patient all summer. Bought more this fall and have been buying more on the way up including some over $3 recently. Cost basis is probably $1.25-$1.50. This is not financial advice. 

Sundial is reporting earnings on March 17th. At that time they will have nearly $800 million cash on hand and no debt. Analysts will update their estimates and price targets a week or two after earnings which could be another catalyst. 

Deal news is very likely, either an acquisition or merger, possibly to break into the US market. I love the Indiva deal from February ($11 million equity and $11 million preferred debt). Sundial owns 18.5% of Indiva common shares. Indiva owns six wonderful brands that are already very popular in the US Market, including WANA gummies. https://www.indiva.com/brands/

SNDL has terrific long term fundamental metrics. Sundial Growers is an investment, not a meme stock. Anyone who values weed companies on a revenue multiple is a motley clown. Sndl cut 50% of workforce in 2020 to focus on profitability and transitioned from strictly growing to more of a direct retail presence which has much higher margins and lower revenue. It’s competitors dump all their cash into revenue and advertising and it’s not comparing apples to apples.

Sundial is doing all of the small things right. This company that could have double or triple its current revenue if it liked burning cash but it doesn’t and turned a normalized operating profit last quarter. In an up-and-coming budding industry it’s easy to say weed stocks are overvalued but get ready for the long term train 🚂 , it won’t look back. 

Weed 🌱 is the new alcohol and cigarettes combined, and the industry is about to break into drinks. Recreational and medical marijuana use will eclipse alcohol sales in 30 years. 

The recent dip in marijuana valuations over the last month will only help a company with $800 million in cash, no debt, that is looking to acquire companies and make partnerships. The recent dip should only help SNDL long term with their deal pricing. Once legislation gets passed marijuana valuations should expand further. 

Sundial stock went down last year from $13 because their first grow at the large indoor facility wasn’t done well and they had mold issues and had to write off profit. They addressed the issue, changed management, put in new processes and stock went down 40 fold. 

They said it about amzn and tsla when things were small. Get ready. I predict we get to $5 then $10 this year. Buy the equity, not the options! Short sellers often sell options and make money by keeping the price flat until options expire. Don’t let them do this and buy the equity instead. 

I owned fcel and bngo before they took off and was astonished with their run. SNDL could absolutely do the same thing. Things take time and it may be a rocky road but the company is setup for huge success in the future. It will likely get acquired in next 5 years anyway. The market judges potential as much as results and SNDL brings massive amounts of both.

2021-03-12 12:50:14,$LUMN - Lumen Technologies (Formerly CenturyLink) by u/uknj,"**$LUMN - Lumen Technologies (Formerly CenturyLink) by** u/uknj

Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink) is a telecommunications company which provides products and services related Network, Cloud, Security, Voice, and Managed Services to enterprise, SME, and retail customers. Lumen is aiming to position itself as a key infrastructure partner underpinning public and private cloud, edge computing and fiber connectivity. LUMN is building its services with 4 key areas in mind:

1. Physical assets and infrastructure – These include fiber, hardware and facilities.
2. Software managed networking – This is a network-as-a-service (NaaS) offering that can be leveraged to connect organisations with
3. Hybrid Cloud – These include private cloud and datacentres, colocation services and connections with public cloud service provider partners.
4. Lumen Orchestrator – This is the orchestration solution that allows for the management and control of the various services that are offered.

I am currently bearish about LUMN with no immediate plans to invest (although in the event of the price dropping into the single digits, I would re-evaluate this position). There are a few key reasons for this, but I encourage you to read the full bullish, bearish, and neutral considerations in the rest of the post:

1. LUMN earns a significant portion of its revenues from legacy offerings e.g., traditional telephony. This revenue stream has been decreasing YoY for the last few years and this is likely to continue.
2. Despite the above, there are significant areas of potential for LUMN – specifically in their Edge Computing and software defined networking offerings (see Organisational Summary below). Edge Computing is only a small % of current revenues and while it is likely to grow, it will take time to significantly grow these streams. I view the Edge Computing growth as a slow burner and small market, but this will grow at a rapid rate in the future.
3. LUMN has a high level of debt, and while they have managed to de-lever and reduce interest rates, the amount of debt is still significant. When accounting for intangibles and goodwill, the level of liabilities is roughly 1.6x the value of assets (although specifically looking at long term debt this is a healthier picture at 70% of non-current assets).
4. Revenues have been consecutively down for the last few years and are unlikely to show a significant turnaround next year. This is somewhat mitigated by improvements in margin which are expected to continue and a healthy level of free cash flow at $2,770 although this has been declining YoY.

Please do have a read of the Bull, Bear and Neutral points in the detailed post below for a more balanced and in-depth view.

# Key Data

All data believed to be accurate as of 05/03/2021

* Price = $13.45
* P/E = -12x
* EPS = -2.12 (dil)
* Forward P/E = 8.5x

# Detailed Analysis

**Bull Considerations**

* $LUMN are well positioned to become significant players in high potential markets – specifically fiber and underlying network infrastructure, NaaS and Edge computing.
* $LUMN has several verticals it can offer to customers including Hybrid Cloud, Connected Security and Collaboration. These can be leveraged to grow revenue streams in parallel (i.e., cross selling products and services to customers).
* Successfully managed to de-lever the company from previous debts. While this is a great deleveraging trend and a significant reduction in interest rates by redeeming outstanding 5.375% and 7.00% notes1 and replacing them with 4% bonds, the level of debt is still a concern (see bearish consideration item 1).
* The dividend from $LUMN has been consistent and relatively attractive (although on a yield basis this is less so if the price continues to rise). The board are committed to continuing the dividend payment and at the present time it can be safely assumed that $0.25 will be paid per share per quarter for the remainder of FY21. Dividend yield should not be the primary reason for going into $LUMN as yield is \~ 7% (at a stock price of $13.70). In the event of a dip to single digits, the dividend becomes extremely attractive and is worth considering (at a yield of > 9%).
* Despite the overall reduction in EBITDA (see bearish item 4), EBITDA margin has improved and is likely to continue improving into FY21 due to cost cutting measures being pushed by executive leadership.
* Significant number of insider purchases throughout 2020 with one sale.

**Bear Considerations**

* Overall, there are likely to be better candidates for returns on investments than LUMN, while LUMN is in a number of attractive areas, it is still growing revenues and these are unlikely to materialise in any significant manner over the next year or two. See competitive advantage section for additional details.
* $LUMN holds significant long-term debt of $31,837 (down from $34,694 in 2019). This debt is primarily due to $LUMN’s all in play to fiber (at the expense of 5g) when they purchased Level 3 Communications for $34,000. It is worth noting that $LUMN has not had an issue with either paying down debt and paying dividends with its current cash flow.
* $LUMN earns a substantial portion of revenues from legacy services. These include voice ($391 in 4Q20) which approximates to 29% of overall revenue. As can probably be guessed, this has regularly declined over the course of FY20. While not all the voice revenue is likely to be a “legacy” product, I am considering it as such as there are likely to be other legacy revenue streams. (N.B. According to $LUMN legacy revenues primarily include voice, private line (including special access), switched access and other ancillary services.)
* $LUMN is facing lengthening sales cycles for its products and services as their customers (and more likely organisations in general) continue to evaluate new infrastructure needs and delay purchasing unless necessary. This is likely to continue until at least 2022 as cost pressure at organisations globally push down purchases.
* Revenues are down both QoQ and YoY with EBITDA down YoY and there is no expectation that they will increase next year with best estimates at stable revenue / EBITDA and worst-case a reduction. YoY revenues have decreased for both FY20, FY19 and FY18, although the rate of decrease has reduced over time.
* Free cash flow while still high is reducing over time and will continue to do so as LUMN are likely to continue to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and paying off its long-term debt.
* Executive compensation (specifically focussing on CEO compensation) is above average for the industry at $17M (compared to an average of $10M for similar sizes). It is worth noting that when comparing against larger companies or those listed as competitors, this level of compensation was not unusual. Compensation did stabilise as performance dropped, however, no decrease in compensation occurred despite the decrease in earnings. While not initially a problem, if the results do not turn around, and there is no decrease in compensation, there is a concern that executive pay is no longer in line with the company’s results.

**Neutral Considerations**

* Long term credit rating (Moody’s) – Ba3: Speculative with substantial - high credit risk.
* Speculative Grade Liquidity Ratings – SGL-2: Good liquidity, will be able to meet their obligations over the next 12 months through mostly internal resources but may rely on external sources of committed financing.
* Southeastern Asset Management has increased its position in $LUMN as of Dec 2020. It is worth noting that they have lost (\~25%) on the investment to date2. Despite this, they remain bullish on the overall prospects as the CEO has tightened controls on costs and margin improves. Additionally, they believe $LUMN can monetise several segments they are in (specifically fiber), and that as a multiple of free cash flow (< 5 at the time of investing) is an attractive valuation. As a final point, they have signed an NDA with $LUMN, and this indicates a higher and more “activist” level of engagement3. I have listed this as neutral despite the bullish sentiment of SAM, as their track record for the last year has not been great compared to the overall market.
* $LUMN will be seeing reduced subsidy revenue (from CAF II – A US initiative to improve connectivity) with subsidies declining to $20 by 2022. However, $LUMN believes their investment into providing this connectivity is likely to add to revenue that will make up for the loss in subsidy.

# Organisation Summary

Essentially Lumen Combine underlying infrastructure with platforms (i.e., cloud PaaS) and Applications (SaaS):

1. **Adaptive Networking** – High performance network connectivity i.e., on premise private lines, Content Delivery Network, fiber internet connectivity, direct cloud connections (where they provide corporate WAN infrastructure a direct link to Cloud) and managed networking services / consulting.

* Content delivery network market growth is forecast to grow at 14% till 20254.
* Fiber Internet connectivity in the US grew at 12% from 2019-202022 and will likely continue to grow at a similar rate for the next few years. Across the EU growth rates are largely similar for both coverage growth and subscriber growth5.
* Software defined networking offerings (Networking as a service) is an expanding industry and likely to see significant growth of 34% annually till 20266.
* Growth rates and industry sizes for private lines and direct cloud connections are not easily available. I believe direct cloud connections are a growth area and likely to grow at a reasonable 10-15% annually for the next few years (based on over all cloud growth, increase in colocation and deployment of data centres – see Hybrid Cloud below).

1. **Collaboration** \- VOIP, teleconferencing, collaboration solutions (e.g., file sharing and virtual meeting rooms all hosted by Lumen, but the products can be from vendors like Zoom, Webex Skype etc.), contact centres and calling services (e.g., traditional phone style calling both locally and internationally as well as toll free / business numbers. Also advanced emergency services support).

* VOIP is relatively mature industry with a CAGR of 12% (at best) till 20257. Personally, I think we can discount any mobile VOIP growth as I do not believe LUMN has offerings in this space and in my view, this would lower the effective CAGR with 8-10% looking a more reasonable target.
* Call centre growth is forecast to grow at 6% till 20278. The US houses over 60% of call centres globally, and this number is only going to decrease as increased internet penetration and decreased telecom rates drive the outsourcing of call centres9.
* Numbers and growth rates to traditional telephony are limited but I imagine that growth is probably negative. For toll free, business numbers and emergency services support, growth is likely positive but limited.
* Collaboration solutions are growing at a reasonably high rate of 13% till 202710. However, LUMN is limited to managing, implementing, running, and hosting products from other vendors as they do not sell their own.

1. **Connected Security** – Threat management (managed threat intelligence), managed SOC services, WAF and DDoS mitigation, managed firewalls, and professional services.

* The WAF market is expected to grow at 18% annually till 202211.
* The DDoS mitigation market is set to grow at 15% annually till 202612.
* The managed security services are expected to grow at a CAGR of 8% till 202513. While I think managed firewall growth is likely to be less than other managed security services (e.g., IAM, SOC etc), a growth rate of 4-6% is probable.

1. Edge Computing – Managed services, connections to both public cloud and private data centres, networking, colocation, cloud. Essentially connecting edge locations / end user servers to backbone infrastructure.

* Edge computing as an industry is forecast to grow at \~25% annually till 202514. However, it is currently a small market valued at \~ $ 2,000 in 20201. Edge computing as a market can be further subdivided into hardware, platform, and services. Hardware is expected to grow at the fastest rate of the three potentially reaching 40%15.

1. **Hybrid Cloud** – Cloud storage, disaster recovery (data replication and business continuity), hosting services, data centres, private and public cloud alongside consulting for cloud.

* The private cloud market is expected to grow at 29% annually till 2025. Private cloud growth will primarily be driven by businesses who wish to take advantage of public cloud capability with the addition of potentially more secure and customisable hosting resources. On-premises cloud growth will be significantly lower than provider hosted options (PaaS / IaaS) which are likely to hit 50%16.
* Hosting services are likely to increase in market size by 15% annually17.
* Deployment of data centres are likely to increase slowly over the next few years with a growth rate not likely to exceed 10% (estimated at 6% for 202118). Similarly, colocation services are likely to see a modest 14% CAGR19.
* Global cloud storage is expected to increase at a rate of 20% till 202520.

# Competitive Advantage

1. **Adaptive Networking:**

* Summary: A large revenue earner with solid growth potential. $LUMN is a large player in the infrastructure space and should be able to leverage that to provide organisations with NaaS and global fiber connectivity.
* From a coverage perspective (compared to Verizon and AT&T as of 2019), $LUMN serves 16% of the population, with Verizon and AT&T serving 17% and 41% respectively. It is worth noting that $LUMN covers more states than either21, 22. N.B. this view is for consumers but presumably also can also be applied to corporate coverage.
* $LUMN is relatively well positioned from a fiber perspective as they have a lot of “unique coverage” (i.e., locations served without significant competition) in the US and have coverage in Europe and Asia. They carry a large portion of internet traffic on their network backbone and have 180,000 locations globally which provide their customers direct access to $LUMN infrastructure. Additionally, they have direct connectivity to several cloud service providers and data centres. Compared to competitors, they appear to have the largest total fiber route23.
* The software defined networking offerings are an exciting growth opportunity and combined with the strong infrastructure position of $LUMN will mean that customers (particularly those that are multinationals and large enterprises) can utilise the network as a service offering to connect their enterprise infrastructure efficiently and effectively across the globe including connections from on-premises to cloud service providers.
* While competitors do exist, from both a software defined networking perspective (e.g., Fortinet, Cato etc.) and an infrastructure perspective (e.g. Verizon, AT&T etc.) $LUMN has the advantage of being a strong player in both areas with good partnerships with Cisco and VMWare.

1. **Collaboration:**

* Summary: Largely a legacy business and revenue generator for $LUMN. This will be a shrinking revenue area for $LUMN as the decline in traditional legacy telephony services is unlikely to be made up for by any growth in VoIP or collaboration solutions. Additionally, this area is a large revenue earner for $LUMN, and significant declines here would result in material impact to value.
* While implementing and managing VoIP, teleconferencing and collaboration solutions with partnered vendors (e.g., Zoom) are likely to show some little to moderate growth over the coming years, they will likely provide consistent revenue due to the underlying network requirements needed to effectively utilise such solutions.
* Traditional telephony services including contact / service centres and business telephony service revenues are likely to shrink over the coming few years.

1. **Connected Security:**

* Summary: The cybersecurity market is an exciting growth area which holds significant potential for $LUMN. However, it remains a small % of overall revenues and so revenue growth in-line with industry expectation will not materially impact the overall value of $LUMN.
* If $LUMN can leverage their verticals in the datacentre / cloud space to cross sell their security services this could see some reasonably large growth, but overall due to the small footprint of $LUMN in the cloud space presently, material value growth due to this vertical is likely be several years out.
* Additionally, $LUMN is not a recognised global player in this industry unlike Akamai or NetScout, and so will be at a disadvantage compared to incumbents with higher profile portfolios.

1. **Edge Computing:**

* Summary: This could be a strong growth area for $LUMN. Could be a way to take advantage of the potentially significant growth area of Edge computing. However, it is likely to significantly materialise only 1-2 years out with little revenue growth in this area prior to then as organisations slowly accept this paradigm shift. Additionally, it will be a highly competitive area that will require significant investment to grow and maintain an advantage.
* As of 23 Feb 2021, $LUMN claims they provide 60% of enterprise locations with <5ms latency to edge nodes. Their goal is 90% by the end of the year and their large fiber network leaves them at an advantage compared to competitors. (See Adaptive Networking).
* An example from the 4Q20 earnings call was SAP using their Edge infrastructure to bring SaaS applications closer to customers and bypassing unnecessary internet traversal.
* While $LUMN can leverage its underlying infrastructure and assets to push a solid offering, this is likely to be a highly competitive space with players including typical cloud service providers e.g. Microsoft, Amazon, Google and HPE as well as specialised players e.g. Mutable. Large cloud players will have both the hardware and software required to compete effectively with $LUMN while also being able to leverage their substantial public cloud technologies to gain an advantage.

1. **Hybrid Cloud:**

* Summary: If you are interested in taking advantage of private or public cloud growth then Lumen probably is not the best value even at its current multiple. This is due to low revenues (as a % of total revenues) from Cloud related activities. Additionally, this space is highly competitive and $LUMN does not appear to have the background or experience (it is working on growing its employee expertise) although they can potentially take advantage of their underlying infrastructure from their fiber and physical assets.
* Personally, I believe Private Cloud is not a significantly growing area with potentially some shorter term increase due to pandemic pushing a more remote working / access focus. However, longer term 3-5 years out, I think hybrid cloud will be the dominant focus as organisations transition from private cloud to increased public cloud usage. Only 3% of enterprises use private cloud exclusively24.
* If you are going to opt for growth within public cloud, there are higher growth options with AMZN, GOOG and MSFT although these are substantially higher in price. Alternatively, Cisco, HPE, or other smaller providers may work. A dedicated cloud provider will likely provide better value than $LUMN due to the low revenue share (see above).

2020-04-19 13:58:20,"AMZN/SHOP - The Fundamental shift towards Ecommerce, SHOP to double","TLDR; There is a massive shift to E-commerce under way across all demographics, and especially under boomers and older people who have resisted online buying. With the spread of the virus, these demographics are shifting to online buying, expanding the market by 50%. Younger people ordering online are doing it even more. The sector will see long term extreme growth. Sales profits will consolidate under SHOP and AMZN. SHOP will double.

Basically right now, as stocks recover, we are going to see a fundamental repricing of companies. Some will be worth more and some worth less, as the economy and the way that people buy and communicate changes. The post pandemic economy will be different, understanding this is where the huge economic opportunity lays. Online sales profits will moon, and the profits consolidate under AMZN and SHOP. 

Shopify is poised to see massive growth as a result. They were already booming, with their previous ATH at 593, they sit at 590 right now. The stock was already on a massive bull run with SHOP before this shift to online buying. With the addressable market for ecommerce effectively doubling over night, SHOP is STILL underpriced. 

How do I know this? AMZN did not start to boom on this until recently announcing they were hiring 100k employees, and then 75k more. This sent their stock booming last week. The market had not priced that in until literally LAST week. It’s still early on these stocks. 

SHOP is basically an index for ecommerce. Going forward, holding shopify is like holding an index on small and medium size businesses selling online. They have extremely low capital requirements, can scale basically immediately as they hold no merchandise, get a cut of every transaction. This is a dream stock.

PROOF:

“As we help thousands of businesses to move online, our platform is now handling Black Friday level traffic every day! 

It won't be long before traffic has doubled or more.”
Shopify CTO - https://twitter.com/jmwind/status/1250816681024331777

Offhand comments from hacker news:

“I am presently scaling a client on Shopify who started at a 30k a month ad budget. Today we scaled past $8,000 per day (So a little under 250k a month). I fully expect and we'll hit $500,000 a month in ad spend for them monthly probably in the next 2 weeks. The combination of increased screen time and major companies pulling ad dollars has cratered media prices, and in the process, created a once in a decade opportunity for DTC brands that have cash on hand and are ready to scale up production. This announcement from Shopify themselves surprises me not at all.”

“Same here. We have provide a warehouse management system specifically for e-commerce warehouses, as SaaS. We are (one of) the biggest player in the Netherlands, and since ""social distancing"" started here 4 weeks ago we see Black Friday 2019 levels of orders every day, for 4 weeks straight now.
We have some customers that saw there orders come to a stop, even a few bankruptcies already. But almost all see a 30-40% bigger order flow. Some customers that sell DIY hair products see a doubling or tripling in orders per day and revenue.
When I talk to the biggest e-commerce players in the Netherlands and the top 3 parcel shippers, they all see (near) black friday levels of orders/shipments.”

Taken from: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22901231

The best part is it doesnt matter if the virus wrecks the economy, sales and profits will consolidate under AMZN and SHOP.

Rationale was a short-term play to buy the dip in the run-up to earnings on July 30 and in anticipation of new stimulus, while recognizing risks of double top, worsening US-China tensions, and worsening COVID. Stock is even for the day, and hoping the $2920 support will hold (famous last words).

Given everything that could happen over the weekend with respect to US-China and COVID and broader market sentiment, would you hold, or sell and repurchase on Monday? Position theta is -$1250, so that's a factor.

It seems to me that the biggest weakness of professional stock analysts is their lack of imagination. Think of the analysts who covered AMZN early on and could only see an on-line book seller. How about the people covering NFLX who could only think about how many DVDs were being broken by USPS. Or the naysayers who still, to this day, look at TSLA as a ""car company"" to be compared to F.

The reason I'm Long GME is a simple, perhaps overlooked, two-sentence comment in the most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, on page 23, which reads:

""***Become the social / cultural hub for gaming.*** Create the social and cultural hub for games and entertainment and expand GameStop’s addressable market through category and product expansion to offer the most comprehensive product offering across the GameStop omni-channel platform. Our customers are increasing their engagement across the spectrum of games, entertainment and technology and our focus remains to meet those expanding needs.""

In my opinion, GME could easily become a multi-purpose gaming hub. After Covid, of course, but imagine this please: GameStop becomes the destination for comics, graphic novels, collectible card games, table top games, and, naturally, video games.

Malls are dying. Imagine a space the size of those pop-up Halloween stores that had an area of connected XBoxs and PS5s (so that a group of friends or strangers could run a Fortnite match. maybe even store vs store matches); a separate area of tables for D&D campaigns; an area to build gaming PCs; and an area for collectible card game matches (GameStops existing used game system could easily be adapted to handle the massive market for M:TG cards). Imagine a wall of comics, graphic novels and magna. Another wall of D&D books, modules, minatures and dice. GameStop locations already have TVs, so why not Livestream Critical Role and eSports events? Of course they could sell snacks and beverages. GameStop has the clout and size to make lucrative leases with Malls and make gaming hubs a reality.

Imagine this gaming hub, with endless free parking, and just a short walk from the Starbucks, Cinnabon, and the entire Food Court! Would you go to such a location? I would!

That's why I'm long 100 GME @ $38.50 and thinking about going longer after I rebalance my portfolio.

Why the fuck do you think a company like PLTR has a 50B MC? This thing does similar numbers to BB but loses more money and is evaluated at 7-8X the current price of BB. It’s because it IPO’d in the middle of the EV/TSLA crazy and had all eyes on it.
 
BlackBerry, however, is a fucking dinosaur! You ask someone on the street that knows nothing about EVs what BlackBerry does and they confidently tell you they make old cell phones. You fuckheads and wetdicks would say the same shit a month ago. That’s not who they are anymore, they just don’t have an IPO to get everyone’s attention which is why you can still get it at such dirt cheap prices.

The past 3 trading sessions were the FIRST 3 trading sessions that this thing has started trading as a speculative play, as it should! It has a new Cybersecurity suite to compete with CRWD, new partnership with AMZN to be a huge player in EV/AV. Huge partnerships with countless OEMs and carmakers, potential to partner with Tesla and it’s about damn time you autists caught on. Instead of trading like the dinosaur company it’s been, it’s starting to trade like the future technologies company it is and will be in the next 3-5 years.

2021-02-18 11:22:51,CRSR - Corsair Gaming DD and why it's undervalued,"Position: 315@36 no financial advise

CRSR is one of the few stocks that is actually fundamentally undervalued in this FED fueled printer market. Let's take a look at the P/S Ratio of some of your favorite stocks and Corsairs. 

[P/S Ratio List](https://imgur.com/a/kTvFTZ1) Price to Sale Ration / Market Cap to Revenue Ratio

I've listed the P/S Ratio and y/y growth from AMZN, AAPL, AMD, PLTR, LOGI and CRSR. You can see that CRSR is trading at a P/S Ratio of just 2.1 and that while having the highest y/y revenue growth of all listed stocks. Not only that but their last quarter had a y/y growth revenue growth of over [70%](https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) and earnings 152% growth. 2020 Revenue even already beating analysts prediction for 2021 sales of $1.72 billion. Basically any tech stock is trading at P/S Ratios of 5 or higher, giving Corsair a 200% upside. 

Andy Paul CEO of Corsair in the Q4 ER:  ""It is clear that a new wave of gamers and streamers has entered the market as well as consumers building gaming PCs for the first time.  Our expectation is that all these people that are new to the market will continue to buy gaming and streaming products from us for many years into the future.""

Growth problem: What is stopping Corsair from further growth? It isn't demand. Corsairs sales could have been even greater if not for the semiconductor and general shortage. Many of Corsair products are sold out and production is being ramped up as fast as possible. Stopping their growth is the rate at which they can ramp up production. [Good news on that end](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order).

""At the moment, the company is more worried about the shortage of semiconductor components. It persisted throughout the fourth quarter,  the company could have raised even more funds if not for such restrictions. 

Streaming peripherals are also in high demand. Corsair said YouTube offered at least 40 million game channels in December. This makes the company’s management believe that streaming activity will soon be as widespread as gaming.""

Analyst Rod Hall continues to see Corsair as ""a high quality participant  in secular video gaming and eSports growth with a strong brand position and diversified product lineup.""

Contrary to some of the newly IPOed hype and meme stocks Corsair is actually operating at a profit, barely. They are basically growing the company as fast as possible without going billions into debt. They managed over 70% y/y growth for their 4th quarter while not opertaing at a loss. This is some good management.

So where is the catch? Why is the stock down? Well there are two bad news I could find.

First the [acquisition of Visuals by Impulse](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285508/corsair-elgato-visuals-by-impulse-acquisition-streaming-twitch) for an undisclosed amount. There is always some uncertainty with acquisitions especially when the paid amount is not stated, leading to concerns that it might have been a bad deal but this is a short term fear and the acquisition will help to reinforce the Elgato ecosystem:

 “With the addition of Visuals by Impulse to the Elgato family, we’re  excited to extend our core mission of empowering content creators.  Design is a crucial element shaping a creator’s identity, and VBI has  been at the forefront of making beautiful and interactive design  accessible to anyone,” wrote Julian Fest, SVP and general manager at  Elgato, in a press release. “Together with the talented team at VBI, we  plan to push the boundaries of what design can mean for creators.” 

Second the Wallstreet analysts fear that ""people will stop gaming when the pandemic ends"". Decide for youself how you feel about this. I don't see how demand will substantially lessen in the next 12-15 months for current gen consoles, graphics cards and cpus and at that point next generation products will be ready. If you look at the [current steam hardware survey](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam) barely 1.2% of people are using 3000 series graphics cards with only 11% of people using 2000 series gpus. Over 80% of active steam users are running systems with 2 or more generations old hardware and are potentially looking to upgrade their systems. Addtionally the entry age for gaming is getting lower and lower. More kids want to play video games and need the hardware to do so. Corsair provides All-In-One Systems, System Cases, full range Power supplies, full range cooling solutions, full range of peripherals, market leading streaming equipment, SSDs and RAM. Basically anything you will need with a pc but the CPU, GPU and motherboard.

The tech demand is not a Corsair only problem though, it is a problem for most tech stocks yet their P/S Ratios are still much higher. These ""out of tech"" rotations were already happening in summer last year because all the so smart Wallstreet analysts thought that ""nobody would buy tech anymore"" since a ""vaccine was near"". 8 months later there is no sign of any demand decline. These analyst try to be smart and predict the demand rotations, truth is TECH IS THE FUTURE. TECH WILL PREVAIL if old smelly men on Wallstreet acknowledge it or not, it doesn't change the inevitable.

Demand growth will decrease eventually but demand will very likely stay at these high levels and lead Corsair to constant further growth. Their prediction for 2021 revenue growth is at a conservative \~15% which will very likely be exceeded. Even with these conservative predictions the current P/S Ratio is a joke and the stock massively undervalued.

[Amateur TA](https://imgur.com/a/bD14NJn) just drew some lines, look somewhere else for a propper one.

Opinion: Maybe the stock will follow its upwards trend in the triangle but I think the stock is basically just waiting for any catalyst to break out. This is probably the last chance to get this under 40$. With a personal predictions of >20% revenue growth for 2021 and the rise of the P/S Ration to a conservative level of 4, the market cap should come to about 8B or an undiluted upside of 220% or 85$ a share.

The stock is experiencing relatively high volatility right now. Stocks or LEAPS are the safer option.

2020-01-14 10:28:36,$AMZN - Why Amazon Is Going to Dominate the Next Decade,"**EDIT: TLDR - Buy AMZN get Tendies - See comments for Trash Talk - Thanks for the Silver!**

**EDIT 2: Thank you** [**u/Dmillehe**](https://www.reddit.com/u/Dmillehe) **spending his money on Platinum instead of AMZN stock. You're the real autist.**

Amazon is going to dominate the next decade. It's a wonderful business trading at a discount to it's true ability to create cash earnings. My thesis is that traditional methods of valuation that work for most companies don't work for Amazon. This misunderstanding between market 'conservatives' or 'traditionalists' .. so called value oriented investors (of which I consider myself a part) is currently reflected in the share price today, and it's a mistake. Second, the firm has reached a point of inflection, where scale will now provide growth of earnings far in excess of growth in sales. This multiyear catalyst provides a fundamental basis for significant share price appreciation.

To understand why Amazon presents such a compelling investment opportunity, one must understand what is currently transpiring in two specific and unique business segments. E-commerce and Cloud Computing. Many of you are probably familiar with at least the former. The latter is foreign territory to most.

**E-Commerce: Why Amazon is prepared to conquer the next decade in retail.**

Traditional retail or brick and mortar (B&M from here on out) is still the dominant form of consumer spending in the U.S. and will be for some time. [As of Q3 2019, total retail spend amounts to $5.4 Trillion dollar for the prior 12 months.](https://www.census.gov/retail/mrts/www/data/pdf/ec_current.pdf) E-commerce amounts to merely 11.2% of this amount (on a run rate basis.) While the size remains relatively small, e-commerce is growing in the mid-teens year over year, or now 5% quarter to quarter and the rate of growth is accelerating. The rate of E-commerce growth has doubled in 12 months.

To understand why this is the case, a qualitative evaluation of the differences between the two is critical. B&M requires physical space that is expensive to build and maintain. It requires uniformed, reliable, friendly and knowledgeable staff. It requires the deliberate presentation of inventory and restocking, amounting to a unique challenge to the retailer of determining layout of shelf space, product mix and promotion.

It's costly for the consumer too. They have to drive there, walk in, and find what they are looking for. This requires owning a car or putting up with public transportation. This can take a significant amount of time. There are some hidden costs too, without E-commerce, price discovery is a pain in the ass. Something retailers are keenly aware of. Here's something interesting about humans and economics. In economics, for a long time, we've modeled humans like they're these perfect rational beings. Ideally.. they'll drive down the road to a different store to get 3% off of whatever they're buying. Ideally. And you **will** do that for a car. But in reality, if it's 3% off a bag of chips, it's not worth the hassle. It's too expensive to go get $.14 of savings when you have to drive another 10 minutes to another grocery, walk in to figure it out if you're actually saving the most money.. consumers don't do that.

Consumers don't engage in price discovery on most of their small dollar purchases, they don't do that with traditional retail, because it's too costly in time and effort. There's too much friction in the trade-off.

The value proposition of E-commerce is that it saves consumers time and money. Getting in the car, loading the kids in the back, driving, parking, and then hunting for what you want, making sure you are getting a fair price, E-commerce throws all of that out the window. The value proposition for retailers too, is that it saves them time and money. There are plenty of retailers currently taking an omni-channel approach to retail, those who want to shop in person get to, those who shop online can do that too.. everybody wins. E-commerce takes the friction out of price discovery on small dollar purchases.

Given the advent of mobile computing more than a decade ago, many big box retailers also adopted a price match strategy, if you can find it online for the same price? Best Buy, Micro Center etc. they'll match it to keep you as a customer. But that's the extent of it, try going to Kroger and arguing with the cashier about Albersons having a 3/$5 deal on Frito Lay Potato Chips.. that ain't happening.

Amazon isn't Ecommerce, they are a part of it. Their strategy is different than the whole. They are technically omni-channel. However the little B&M they've done mostly as R&D experiment, more on Whole Foods in a minute. The Amazon E-Commerce thesis is this: **At the end of the day, most consumer purchases are commodity purchases.** They are small dollar items that are easily replicated. This segment of retail has yet to be disrupted by E-Commerce until now. It overlaps with specialty retail and big box items almost seamlessly from a logistical standpoint. The revenue streams are more stable than specialty retail, and it presents a massive opportunity in the long run.

I had the chance to speak with a finance manager at Frito-Lay (subsidiary of PepsiCo) years back after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Amazon had been attempting for years to get the same products you see in any Kroger or Albertsons onto their platform. For a variety of reasons, PepsiCo would not play ball with Amazon. It amounted to channel conflicts between the big established players vs. the disruptive incumbent. What Pepsico had done to Amazon, had been done by Proctor and Gamble, Nestle, Kellogg, and many more.

The purchase of Whole Foods was a big F U, a ""we'll do it live"" moment.. a Leeroy Jenkins. So you won't let us into your club? Fine, we'll do it ourselves. [Grocer's panicked and for good reason](https://qz.com/1211449/amazon-is-wreaking-havoc-on-grocers-like-albertsons/). They were the reason Amazon had been held at bay for so long. They'd used their absolute size for many years to prevent E-commerce retailers from getting the same product mix at the same price online. Amazon responded by entering their territory, in buying a physical grocery chain. Grocer's fear was real and warranted, however the truly brilliant component of this purchase was that Amazon purchased for themselves a supply chain for grocery and private label products (365 brand.) Fast forward a couple years and Amazon now has over [four hundred private label brands, more than twenty three thousand individual SKUs and 1.4 Million reviews of these products/brands.](https://www.marketplacepulse.com/amazon-private-label-brands) That entire article is worth a thorough read. Each product line represents a moonshot where amazon can collect both sides of margin on a private label product that disrupts traditional brands. Often it goes well, sometimes it does not, but the platform allows them to poke holes in each product category, and cannibalize the producer surplus of other more expensive branded product in the process. They don't have to advertise, market or promote any of this either.. yet [it's already getting plenty of attention](https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1120847137149833217?lang=en). 

[Here is a compelling example of how Amazon can undercut a premium brand with it's store brand knock off.](https://medium.com/@joeyzwillinger/dear-mr-bezos-e691f6d6d705) And there's nothing Allbirds can do about it.

Amazon has built out an infrastructure of warehouses (which are relatively cheaper to maintain on a $/sf basis than traditional B&M retail space) and delivery drivers to meet the daily needs of consumers accustomed to B&M retail. They've disinter-mediated the entire process. You do not need a car, you don't have to be nice to the person behind the counter, or go hunting for that specific product you need on aisle 9, or check to see if the price is competitive or on deal. You can just type it in to your phone in 5 seconds, and see quickly who has the best deal. Turns out (and this is from experience) 9/10 times Amazon has the best deal and they'll ship it that day or the next.

For the consumer, it amounts to savings in both time and money. What the data shows is that we are experiencing rapid change in slow motion. E-commerce is growing explosively here in the U.S. however it's still of relatively small scale, that it will take some time before eclipsing B&M retail. Second, the data shows this rate of growth is accelerating, and has **doubled in the last year or so**. Traditional retail is not going to disappear entirely either. There are plenty of Amazon proof businesses for now. Hair salons, vets, dentists, nail salons, along with restaurants and apparel to a certain extent.

This online E-commerce platform has allowed Amazon to build out a peripheral advertising business in search. The search component allows Amazon to promote it's own store brand product alongside the branded counterparts. Second, it's able to sell web page space to branded products. [Google currently dominates the search game, but Amazon is in 2nd place and stealing market share.](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/amazon-gaining-google-search-advertising-market-share/)

Finally, Amazon has rolled out a wonderful product called [Subscribe and Save](https://www.amazon.com/Subscribe-Save/b?ie=UTF8&node=5856181011). Within this platform, Amazon is able to offer 15%-20% savings on everyday commodity items in exchange for a commitment to purchase at a monthly frequency (and it can be cancelled at any time.) What Amazon has discovered is that subscription purchases are relatively sticky. In exchange for a soft commitment from consumers that is relatively stable and predictable, Amazon can actually lower the cost of goods to the consumer. In turn, they are also able to optimize logistically for these sales as they can plan far in advance for them. Second, this allows them to relay demand information to other merchants as well. Example: Amazon can remit data to Tide, and let them know how many pods they expect to need in the coming months based on subscription commitments. Both Tide and Amazon are able to lower CoGS because they have more time to plan for those costs.

Furthermore, if you have an Amazon Credit Card through Chase bank, [you get an additional 3%-5% all purchase at Amazon & Whole Foods.](https://www.chase.com/personal/credit-cards/amazon/earn-rewards)

The combination of all of these benefits as a platform amounts is an incredibly compelling value proposition to consumers. As of June this year Amazon has accumulated [105 Million Prime Memberships in the United States](https://www.statista.com/statistics/546894/number-of-amazon-prime-paying-members/), and it is the largest paid subscriber base of any company in the United States period.

One of the luxuries I enjoy in my occupation is that my employer has a very long investment time horizon & high risk tolerance. What this allows is for us to kick back, put our feet on the table and think about what the world will look like in 10 years and how we'd consider being a part of it.

So here's a thought experiment, what do you think the retail experience for consumers looks like in a decade? Here's my prediction. Consumer's buy the vast majority of the things they need online, and they receive it within a few hours to a day, and they're spending less than ever before on what they need. [This is already happening](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-effect-inflation-deflation-2017-10), and [It's grabbed the attention of people like Jim Cramer](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/03/cramer-remix-amazon-still-one-of-most-powerful-deflationary-forces.html), as well as [Fed Chairman Jerome Powell](https://www.forbes.com/sites/modeledbehavior/2018/04/07/is-amazon-holding-back-inflation/#7c8985593c02). Albeit, E-Commerce is relatively small for now, but the rapid transformation is already causing ripple effects across retail. In 10 years, my thesis is that E-commerce becomes the largest component of total retail sales and Amazon remains the largest component of that segment, as it is today. Additionally, they probably steal share and grow at a faster pace than E-commerce as a whole, as they have done over the last several years.

**Personal anecdote:**

I'm sitting here in my home office wearing [Amazon branded Jeans](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Essentials-Mens-Slim-Fit-Stretch/dp/B07BJL18M5/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=amazon+jeans&qid=1578627734&s=apparel&sr=1-1). I've got 10+ Amazon branded undershirts upstairs, along with 5+ pairs of Amazon Synthetic Golf Shorts. In my house, we've got Amazon branded batteries, note cards & printer paper, detergent pods, echo devices, cameras and more all over the place. There's more too, but I'm not going to list it all. In my experience, what they make is just as good if not better than the branded counterpart, and they do it for less, often a lot less. And I got tired of hyperlinking, so if you're curious, go to [amazon.com](https://amazon.com/) and start looking around for these products.

Even more, as of now my wife and I spend +$250/mo on subscribe and save items we need for our household, this includes baby formula, diapers and wipes, detergent, shampoo and soap, trash bags, dog food, paper towels and more. We use the 5% back credit card and blended save close to 20% on these daily items we need.

**In conclusion, on E-Commerce, I expect Amazon to dominate the next decade in retail. They have a massive competitive advantage over other retailers engaged in an omni-channel strategy, therefore it's their game to lose. Furthermore, their competitive edge today will compound into the future and amount to further share gains and a wider moat in years to come.**

**Cloud Computing: What is this industry, how does Amazon fit in the picture, and why is it such a big deal?**

Again, to understand Amazon you'll have to understand what Cloud Computing is. This is not an everyday consumer product/service, therefore it's foreign to most individuals. Second, because the transactions and services are business to business (B2B) it's relatively difficult to determine detailed industry characteristics. What may come as a surprise to you, is it's the most profitable business segment (on a NOPAT basis) and it's also their fastest growing segment.

Cloud computing is the service of providing storage, services, databases, software, security, analytics, artificial intelligence and infrastructure through the internet. There was a time when most businesses built their own server racks, and maintained their own infrastructure. Amazon too did this for themselves in building out their own infrastructure to maintain their E-Commerce platform. In time, they naturally sold this service to other firms.

So where does Amazon fit in now? From all indications cloud computing appears to be an arms race. The most recent estimates for market share vary depending on the research provider. The differences lie in what is being measured. There are multiple components of Cloud: PaaS, IaaS, and SaaS. By all accounts, Amazon Web Services is the clear market leader, but they aren't growing as fast as some of their well funded peers like Microsoft and Google.

The available literature on Cloud Computing as a whole is vague. There are important questions to answer regarding structural advantage or lack thereof, who has the competitive edge, or what kind of moats have been built. Amazon's slowing growth rate in Cloud is concerning. Ramped spend in R&D + SG&A during the 2019 fiscal year is encouraging, and these investments will reduce erosion of market share.

While Cloud remains Amazon's most profitable business segment for now, by revenue it's just \~12.5% of sales. Admittedly I am troubled by the amount of information I cannot obtain without significantly paying out of pocket. Nevertheless, given the relative size of this business, I'm comfortable putting the pencil down on AWS for now, and watching the industry closely going forward.

**Other Business Segments:**

Amazon has other business segments like their own B&M retail stores including Whole Foods, it's [4 star retail chain](https://www.amazon.com/b/?node=20017628011&ref=AMZ4STR_GoogleListing_JDA1) as well as it's cashierless Amazon Go stores. All of these combined are worth little compared to the market cap, while interesting.. they are insignificant in determining Amazon's value as a business.

**What is Amazon worth today?**

Herein lies the problem for analysts when the look at Amazon. The most commonly used methods for determining value are off the charts, for the most part Amazon looks like lighting money on fire.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7iq4kk8hesa41.png?width=1703&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7b8a9fb6090406db8e0ddd51e9e776062b646cd

A simple value oriented investor looks at a trailing P/E of 84.19 and thinks **why would I wait 84 years to get paid back?**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d76fratiesa41.png?width=1689&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cc4e3e57054f658a33a7173084e1a5338da1997

Of course, that's too myopic, and value oriented investors who take that approach, quickly learn trailing P/E is the key to building a portfolio of value traps. More sophisticated investors like [Joel Greenblatt](http://www.poslovni.hr/media/PostAttachments/1203672/Joel%20Greenblatt%20-%20The%20Little%20Book%20That%20Beats%20the%20Market.pdf) might recommend using something like ROIC to gauge how much Amazon benefits from reinvesting and building out it's own business.

The problem with that approach is that ROC, ROCE, and ROIC all use some form of GAAP earnings (either NOPAT or EBIT) to backsolve for this return number. If you look at Amazon's Income Statement, and dissect why net income is what it is there's a good reason why most value metrics/ratios don't work for Amazon. They are investing \~3x NOPAT and 60% of Gross profit into R&D. SG&A tells a similar story. What is R&D anyways? One time costs to develop and build out a business. What is SG&A, variable manpower with a significantly lagged ROI when ramped more than 20% YoY.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/15v33d1lesa41.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4562988962ffc48d858a24b2a190b4db65f4c3d

What dawned on me months ago is this.. what if Amazon cut it's R&D to 0, and didn't touch SG&A? P/E TTM drops to \~20x. What happens to sales growth then? It slows.. and eventually converges with GDP, and then falls beyond that. The story of what Amazon's business is, especially E-Commerce, helps shed light on how long it'd take for Amazon's growth to converge with GDP, when they're on the cutting edge of the knife, and most other competitors remain far behind.

What do other institutions believe Amazon is worth?

https://preview.redd.it/wuzx3n6nesa41.png?width=482&format=png&auto=webp&s=959d83285bb9f67715415a9011802e6039d72d2d

There are 45 Wallstreet Analysts covering the stock. On average, their price target is 2170. Based on the share price today, if they're right, you can expect a 15% return. What if the bears are right? You'll lose \~2% rounding down. And the bulls? the highest estimate is 2550, and represents a 35% premium on the stock.

Here's what Morningstar thinks:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/capam6koesa41.png?width=598&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2ae1e2e6b91882f60c01dec9cb983c8439ccfa8

Keep in mind, the last price is a bit dated. Let's pretend Morningstar is right, I like them more than most analysts. You can expect a 22% return.

I don't like wall street analysts, if I did, I wouldn't do this, and I'd just follow their guidance. They are often right, but can be very wrong at times. The problem with wall street analysts is that they are subject to herding, as well as many other behavioral biases and sometimes conflicts of interest.

But assuming they're right, this is an asymmetric long to take, with significant upside today.

I have an estimate for fair value as well. This involves taking the current growth rate for amazon as well as the mean estimate of earnings two years out. However, instead of earnings, I like mean cash flow per share, because it remains undistorted by GAAP adjustments.

Here are the current cash flow per share estimates:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9e4sgdmqesa41.png?width=773&format=png&auto=webp&s=d878cacc7620af283233c63ab493c6500b55ba0c

Here is my valuation model:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3pqriw0sesa41.png?width=1694&format=png&auto=webp&s=16810d9c5ad87ca7b10b01ae3cb590e774f28340

Bottom left in yellow: that is the implied value of AMZN shares today, based on the discounted free cash flows.

Bottom middle with a red circle around it, those are my assumptions for long term growth rate and EPS 2 years out.. so TTM 2021 cash flows.

This would imply a 63% upside on the share price today.

Now, I don't think anyone is getting 63% today, for AMZN shares. Admittedly I'd be surprised if you got \~$3100 for AMZN shares in a year. Unfortunately.. this business will probably continue to be misunderstood like it has been for many years until they're done reinvesting a significant portion of their gross profit into building the infrastructure that expands their business. However, that cash flow number will become remarkably close to EPS with R&D turned off. When it does, share price will rocket. Instead of this becoming a one time event, I expect convergence will be gradual over time, which makes it a long term hold.

**More on valuation:**

I was disappointed but not surprised to find [I'm not the only one thinking about valuation in this way](https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/AMAZON.COM_INC/0950248237#description). The authors take is similar to mine, and he comes to a similar conclusion as well: \~20x P/E TTM. I've gone through everything the VIC has to say about AMZN and most everything should be available to you as non-members as it is dated. I found message 109 especially compelling:

https://preview.redd.it/g91fx2ptesa41.png?width=1221&format=png&auto=webp&s=4edce5cbfdb19ae88045ad45b574ee1d7ff60694

**In Conclusion:** I recommend Amazon stock as a long term investment. I believe this is one of the best value propositions available in this market. Regardless of the broader stock market, the secular trends within retail are significant tailwinds to Amazons largest business segment.

**Disclaimer:** This document is entirely my own work, outside of linked/pictured information above which has been cited. I own a significant amount of AMZN stock personally. I am not responsible for your gains or losses. I may add more information to this document in the future.

**Addendum (1/14/20):** The most significant risk to this business is political. The election of either Warren or Sanders in November of this year would most certainly affect valuation for this business in the near term. Whether Amazon is actually harmed by political interference is another story. For now, it appears the odds that either of these candidates receives the nomination is significantly below 50%, furthermore, as of now it appears they would be significantly disadvantaged against the orange man.

2021-02-26 09:16:46,Why equities are just in the beginning of the bull run [Long post],"TL;DR: This post will try to present the thesis that equities are just in the beginning of the bull run and argues that you should be investing in the stock market right now.

# Premise:

Equities are selling off due to rising [treasury yield.](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/textview.aspx?data=yield) The reason behind the rise of treasury yields are complex.

But let me try to explain nonetheless.

1. People are expecting that the economy will reopen successfully and will have a higher inflation and all that stuff. Now yields being that low, it was slowly getting unattractive as bonds are not necessarily the best investment if the economy goes into full gear as there is less need for safety and [more appetite  for risk assets](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bonds-markets-idUSKBN29Q2NR). Plus, bonds were already at a price where yields  couldn’t have gone any lower(meaning existing bond prices couldn’t have gone any higher). Thus, this lower demand  lead to a rise in yields.
2. This created a feedback loop due to mortgage-backed bond investors selling off their treasury bonds which helped the treasury yield to go even higher. They do it due to convexity hedging. If you have no idea about what I said, [read this one up.](https://www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/convexity-hedging-haunts-markets-already-reeling-from-bond-rout) This has been one of the primary driver behind the recent movement of treasury yield. Overall, this elevated level in treasury yield is unlikely to sustain because the FED continues to abolish the free market and will continue to buy. Thus, the yield is unlikely to rise too much higher.
3. JPow and Yellen has already given us enough indications that they will accept lower rates for a longer period of time. Specifically, until we reach full employment. Thus, they will allow the economy to get hot and also allow inflation to rise if the mean inflation is 2%. These are based on their publicly stated statements, which means it may mean something.
4. Now, consider the scenario, real interest rate will remain negative, the yield in treasury is unlikely to reach too high because of the artificial market scenario. While, we know that ***long term bonds outperformed stocks tremendously*** over the [last 20 years(article data till April 29)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/business/bonds-beat-stocks-over-20-years.html) With long treasury bonds having an annualised return of 8%+, while S&P 500 having only 5.5%+; that was a terrible risk adjusted return for stocks. The same picture emerges for the last 5 years [since 2015(dataset ourdated).](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-17/long-dated-treasuries-crush-s-p-500-performance-over-five-years)
   1. This whole ordeal is because yield was very high at the beginning of the century. And as yield continued to fall, the bonds rose in price, as is customary. Now, as the yield slightly rises, it quickly becomes more attractive as the yields could fall pretty quickly and increase the bond price. This also attracts more bond investors; as a result, I suspect that yields will not rise too much. Plus, it is a very crowded trade.
   2. As a result of bond having this superb risk-adjusted return, stocks saw huge outflows. According to Cathie Wood, [stocks saw $300B in outflows(excluding repurchases)  since 2018 and bonds saw $1T in inflows.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stocks-arent-in-a-bubble-but-heres-what-is-according-to-fund-manager-ark-invests-cathie-wood-11612958113) So, if there is actually any bubble, it is in the bond market. Think about it for a second. Sure, bonds provided absolutely superior risk-adjusted return compared to stocks, but because of this, everyone and their mother are in bonds. Stocks were like the orphan child in the bigger scheme of various financial markets.
      1. Now, bond yields are rising slightly and the yield curve is normalising, but going any higher is unlikely due to the slow abolishment of free market. In this scenario, we won't be seeing any negative rates, while continuing to experience negative real interest rate; being a bond investor would be painful. If you are a bond investor already, you want the yield to go lower, potentially negative, but that is not happening either. If yields rise, you are losing money. If you are a prospective bond investor, you have to worry if yields will go higher just after you invest with all the inflation shenanigans going on.
5. Liquidity is present in the market. Bonds aren't that attractive, stocks are a good bet in this scenario. Especially with all those stimulus talks and stuff. Inflation is also good for the stock market overall as long as we don't go Weimar republic style. After all, you are duddenly not going to stop buying from AMZN, stop using MSFT products or PLTR products just because inflation is here. Question is, which stocks? I think boomer stocks are your best friend(look for the things BRK buys). And after the whole convexity hedging and yield rising stabilises, buying the dip in the tech stocks wouldn't be a bad idea either(I think).
6. US Dollar has been declining after March. It is, overall, good for the stock market and the global economy in general. For one, it makes it easier for foreigners to buy US stocks and two, it boosts the earnings of our corporations in foreign markets. One could say, EM stocks are a potential good source for risk-adjusted return and I also think the same. Although, short USD have had been a popular, crowded and winning strategy for the last year, one should be careful in doing so as any black swan event could catapult the USD higher. However, in the long run, I suppose EM stocks would also be a good area to look out for. Especially, India seems to be the choice for our lawmakers currently.
7. Rising commodity prices and stuff are mostly due to speculation, and not specifically supply crunch. Some are saying that we will see very high inflation due to supply shortage, which would be bad for the market. But I disagree. We have so many structural deflationary forces within our economy. Stagnating wages, high unemployment, technological innovations, cheap labour based production in foreign countries, demographic challenges etc. Some supply crunch is definitely there, but to say that production won't normalise after demand rises due to reopening and stuff is being wilfully blind.
   1. Some of you may not know that CPI does include rents, healthcare expenditures and stuff based on how much they actually cost us, so, before you comment that the government is manipulating CPI to make inflation numbers low, I would suggest you to read how [and what are the weights of each consumption factors.](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/home.htm) Also, stimulus money hardly increases velocity of money because it doesn't really counter the loss of employment income.
8. Our government is doing a shit ton of deficit financing, from that we can expect they will do everything to stop deflation and inflate away the debts. It is in the best interest of our government to keep borrowing money at low cost and to inflate away the debt. Thus, our government has a huge incentive to keep the yield low, while also allowing inflation to rise. You may think, how can this be a free market if... basically, this is capitalism with USA characteristics. Add to that, direct or indirect beneficiaries of these shit ton of deficit financing is, well, the various companies.

# Conclusion

Using my crystal ball, which cost me $0 to buy, I can say this:

This is what I can say from all the points that I have mentioned. Risk assets like stocks are now more attractive than bonds. USD is accommodative for the stock market. Global economic recovery, especially in EM economies will be good, thus helping our companies. Deficit financing. Inflation will be good for ***most*** stocks. Liquidity is present. Bond yields will also stabilise soon as the feedback loop ultimately stops. No deflation. There is likely going to be real inflow into stocks. Stocks will probably finally outperform long term bonds.

Thus, I think, while we will have lower overall rate of return in this decade, I think we will continue to have a good bull market for a while. Current panic in the market is nonsensical to me.

^(Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I eat crayons and stuff. This is a casino. Don't listen to retards on the internet, please don't. I also have used my crystal ball to predict all those future outcomes.)

Risk of my predictions being completely off the mark.

* Fed decides to increase fed funds rate suddenly for overheating/other events and starts quantitative tightening.
* We do have a huge supply crunch in every sector after reopening and inflation goes to the moon. Yields also goes to the moon.
* Black swan events.
* Think of something yourself man! This was a long ass post and I am getting late for finishing my day's work.",218,0.93

2021-03-08 17:05:39,PLTR: Foundry vs Gotham DEMO," 

If you haven't seen the demo for either OS, check it out here!

Foundry is going to change the foundation of the typical supply chain with seamless data integration for live predictive models and active problem solving. With AWS, AMZN, offering an ERP suite with PLTR tech allows companies to save money instantly by integrating data to allow AI to find ways to be more profitable. BP saved 50 million within two weeks of using Foundry.

Gotham has been a staple for the U.S. military for active decision making and ""Gotham is an AI-ready platform that improves and accelerates decisions for operators at every echelon and in every domain — land, sea, air, space, and cyber.""

Any company that has massive amounts of data will turn to use PLTR services and continue to expand the commercial growth of the company. One of the biggest gripes of PLTR was its overreliance of revenue in the government sector. We are at a pivotal time where the company will continue to add contracts and get closer to profitability. Once we were completely out of the pandemic, companies will want to free up more capital to supplement the growth of the overall market i.e. higher operations costs. If you are discouraged, I would watch these demos. It will excite you.

2020-07-30 09:07:56,10B government cloud deal between AMZN & Microsoft to be decided next month,"From Seeking Alpha :

The Pentagon says a decision will be made by the end of next month after revisions to the JEDI solicitation and reviews of Amazon (AMZN +0.4%) and Microsoft's (MSFT -0.8%) bids are completed.

Pentagon CIO Dana Deasy, during a remote press briefing: ""We are still on schedule to, I guess you could say, do a re- announcement of our intentions to award probably sometime toward the very end of August, barring any last minute unforeseen additional issues that are raised.""

The Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure cloud contract has up to a $10B value over a decade of work, which created a fierce battle between tech companies.
The Pentagon awarded the contract to Microsoft, but Amazon quickly sued for alleged errors and bias and paused the project.

I was following this deal when news first broke, to anyone who was not, Microsoft already won the contract but AMZN interjected that the decision was unfair, it has since been pushed back until next months Calls on both would probably be the best decision here. Who you guys got?",9,0.77

2020-12-12 10:36:31,"Amazon.com: Overvalued, undervalued, fairly valued?","Ladies and gentlemen,

it's your boy chimpu with the trading range for the upcoming week, SPY between 200 and 8.000, personal bias moon.

Now that I got your attention I want to present you a lengthy (yawn) analysis of Amazon (AMZN) stock. For the tl;dr look out for the rockets. Seriously, some lost components of that SPCE rocket might fall onto you so watch out.

I spare you from why Amazon is the obvious winner this year, we all know that. My focus rather is on valuation and also a little bit of TA (I know it's bogus but good enough for confirmation bias).

So from a valuation standpoint of view Amazon has gained 68,65% ytd. This seems like a good bull run outperforming the broader market. However, since the beginning of July, the stock started to trade sideways not gaining any traction to the upside.

[YTD performance](https://preview.redd.it/7athhpnnds461.png?width=1515&format=png&auto=webp&s=037cc4d739a1ce7867c645318e770a7d24b571b3)

However, those 68% do not tell the true story. We have to look back to the 19th February 2020. The stock closed at $2.170. Days and weeks later, the rona crashed the market and Amazon went down with it (to the 1600s). From the pre-rona high till Friday close (Dec 11), Amazon gained *only* 43,7%.

[pre-rona till today gain](https://preview.redd.it/u7bcxq5afs461.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2dbb287cdaeeb247f42ea7037723630f42d677bd)

That is, in all honesty not the best performance in the market considering the stellar rise of the Snowflakes, Nios, Palantirs, Fastlys & co. And I don't want to compare these stocks with Amazon, because Amazon of course fights against the law of the large numbers and is a 1.6T dollar behemoth that moves slower by nature.

Btw: The yellow line above seems like a good trend line being a support several times in recent weeks, doesn't it?

Now, valuation:

The classical valuation metric is P/E ratio. Amazon currenty trades at a 91 P/E ratio on a trailing twelve months basis. This is slightly above the historical average during the last 2 years or so (I don't want to talk about 2015 when there were no earnings or when it traded at a 1000 multiple).

[TTM P\/E ratio](https://preview.redd.it/6nqmxgjqgs461.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=91895116667b2fe9de1319018e66441b080e0ca8)

For a FY2020 prediction we have to look into the guidance that Amazon gave us, which - if we take the middle of it - would lead us to about the same TTM EPS by the end of FY2020 and therefore the same P/E ratio (\~90). Amazon, using these numbers wil report about $17.5 bn in earnings.

That 90 P/E ratio may sound more expensive than it was pre-Covid, but it misses one vital fact: The Covid-related extra expenses + the money Amazon invested into its business in 2020 ([amazon grows physcial space by 50% in 2020](https://www.inddist.com/company-expansion-consolidation/news/21142476/amazon-expects-to-grow-its-physical-space-by-50-this-year)). At least Covid-related costs are temporary only and thus in the mid-term future these extra expenses will be additional pure cash on Amazon's earnings statement. But how high were those extra costs related to the rona? Adding up the sum Amazon itself expected in their Q1, Q2 and Q3 2020 report this reaches $10 bn (4+2+4bn), see [Amazon's Qs reports](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/quarterly-results/default.aspx). So the (conservative, as Amazon always crushes earnigns guidance and eastimates in recent times) $17.5 bn + $10 bn would sum up to $27.5 bn earnings. Let's assume Amazon doesn't grow earnings in 2021, with a stock price of $3100 that would now lead us to a forward P/E ratio of 56,7. Now that doesn't seem too expensive anymore for a company that will this year grow revenues by about 35% and just having grown their Q3 earnings 96% YoY.

Assuming above that Amazon's earnings will stall, while Amazon's revenue growth definitely will slow in 2020, this almost definitely won't be the case for earnings in 2021 due to the effects mentioned above. Other effects propelling Amazon's earnings higher will be classical economy of scale arguments, e.g. cost efficiency in the logistics department as Amazon continues to build its own cost saving delivery infrastucture. Another factor for that is that the business segments with the highest margins will be the ones growing their revenue the most, namely AWS, the ad segment and the recurring prime subscription fees.

Amazon's recent move into the pharmacy business should not be disregarded but isn't even necessary to drive Amazon's numbers higher.

And we should also expect Amazon to blow out earnings. They will beat to the upside both top and bottom line, driving numbers higher and multipes even lower. Use google trends to find out yourself with the [google trends search tool](https://trends.google.de/trends/explore?date=2019-09-01%202020-12-12&geo=US&q=%2Fm%2F0mgkg) (it is worth to be mentioned that the google trends search tool doesn't really reflect the growth, as the average basket size per order at Amazon grows as well as this feature of course only tracks people who go to google first and type ""amazon"" to go to their website instead of visiting it directly or - more important - using the app. It just gives you an idea).

***Approaching Amazon's valuation on a Cash flow based modell***

Above we approached valuation with an earnings-focused modell and saw that in the not too distant future Amazon will be able to slowly lower their earnings ratios approaching the likes of Apple, Alphabet or Miscrosoft (in the central or upper 30s).

However, if we ever based our investment decision about Amazon on a earnings multiple modell, the stock would have never been a buy and we missed out the entirety of this growth story. Therefore, in my opinion it is better to measure Amazon's value on a Cash-flow basis. This not only allows us to understand the actual profitability and margins of the business, but also shows how heavily Amazon invests in its business to expand and grow by all measurable figures.

Of the greatest interest to me is the Operating Cash Flow (OCF). Amazon's FY2017 OCF was $18.5bn and now is at about $52.2bn on a TTM basis. This is an incease of 176% in less than 3 years.

[Amazon's OCF 2017-TTM](https://preview.redd.it/ulu1b59mos461.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f168135fd272e024f23e5a589ecaaf486b1ee838)

For comparison, Microsoft: MSFT's OCF at the end of theor fiscal year in June 2017 was at $39,5bn, now it is at $66,2bn, which is a growth of 67,6% in a time of 3,5 years.

[Microsoft's OCF 06\/2016-TTM](https://preview.redd.it/6rnhdsv6ps461.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=06ebf214f9049a8dda0489badc1a0bbb8e5f4058)

Both are amazing growth rates, both are amazing companies, Amazon is a true growth stock and Microsoft sits somewhere between growth and value.

&#x200B;

If - again looking at the Cash Flow statement of Amazon above - one can see the immense amount of money Amazon is investing in its business. On a TTM basis this amounts to more than -$35bn Investing Cash Flow. And as I mentioned above, we can physically see this growth and these costs looking at the porches of the sUbUrBaN wOmEn'S houses drowning in Amazon parcels. This amount of parcels can only be delivered by expanding the logistics infrastructure, warehouse capacity and workforce. And this expansion is right there above, in the TTM Investing Cash Flow -$35bn. Once Amazon has grown to a fully unfolded, mature company with the groundwork being laid years ago, these investing expenditures will decrease and in combination with further economy of scale synergies their earnings will be propelled higher and higher.

But we are right now nowhere near a truly mature Amazon. With the growth rates Amazon has today, it will be the largest listed company of the US rather sooner than later.

***Now an itzy bitzy of TA***

Look at the first chart I posted at the very beginning of the analysis. You see a tightening triangle. Amazon bounced of the lower support time several times in recent weeks building higher lows. At the same time Amazon made lower highs since the Sept. 2 ""crash"". Amazon is poised to breakout soon. Last week was calendar week 50. Calender week 50 is from a historical perspective Amazon's worst by far. That being behind us now leaves us with a stronger momentum, especially when Christmas is over and with regards to the upcoming FY2020 report late January.

Short term, Amazon also made some green hammers into the close on Thu and Fri which leaves me hopeful on a strong momentum for next week if not the Pfizer vaccine news crashes the stay-at-home-stocks entirely (Amazon unjustified as it did not rally some 500% like those mentioned before but rather 43%). But: No matter what might happen in the short or medium term, Amazon will be on a moon mission with papa Bezos being rocketman on his dick shaped space needle.

2021-02-06 14:38:03,BB: My totally not made up girlfriend who lives in Canada,"This is not financial advice or an attempt to convince you to buy. I am merely sharing an opportunity I believe exists because the market has not yet come around to how BB has repositioned itself.  

There’s also better DD on Blackberry than this and if you’re interested you should search it. 

**TL;DNR why BB?**

1. Because they are a key player in the ridiculously lucrative software fields of advanced AI, cyber security and autonomous vehicles. 

2. Because they are criminally undervalued based on their partnerships and future prospects (more below). 

3. Because there is value. This is not GME, there won’t be another GME. But like GME in the fall when shorts didn’t understand the gaming cycle, there is a gap between prevailing opinion and reality. 

**Don’t they make boomer phones?**

No. They don’t make *any* phones. In fact they sold all of their phone patents to Huawai. They have completely reinvented themselves as a software company and are on the cusp of a monumental turnaround. 

**Wait, so what do they do? (This part is IMPORTANT)**

Software. And not just any software, but software that the market generally values extraordinarily high. 

They are about to be dominant in automobile operating systems. Seriously. Blackberry. As u/gangusgun pointed out their QNX OS is in more than 175 million cars. They inked a deal with Baidu to develop their autonomous vehicle. They inked a deal with Amazon to develop and market BlackBerry's ""Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform"". They inked a deal with Sony to provide the basis for their EV. Their integrated system will be mass-produced and available on Guangzhou Automobile Group electric vehicle arm’s upcoming GAC New Energy Aion models. GAC has a joint venture with NIO. 

19 out of 25 EV companies currently use QNX. **With GM and others moving away from ICE in the near future who do you think they’re going to partner with? Mother. Fucking. Blackberry.**

Amazon. Baidu. NIO. Sony. (And SpaceX but that’s unrelated to cars). Do these seem like bad companies run by stupid people to you?

And yet, the market is still valuing this stock as if it’s making phones, rather than being the eyes and ears of every vehicle on the road. As u/forshakuras pointed out in their DD that you should really read if you have any interest in the company, BB is valued at $6.5B despite $475M in recurring revenue and 26% year over year growth. Similar companies that have had slightly better growth but perhaps not as bright of a future (my opinion, not his) are valued at 8 times as much. 

**But it’s still just a meme stock right?**

I’m not judging GME or AMC. You can see from my comment history that I have been talking about GME for a really long time. But GME was a fling. BB is not a company that sells physical games that no one buys in 6,000 stores that no one goes to. And while I think AMC could have a monster summer if people feel safe going to the movies it still has crippling debt and a fundamentally changed market where direct to consumer releases are now a thing. 

BB got caught up with those companies because it’s viewed as wsb ‘tards making nostalgic picks. *Which proves my point that people don’t yet get what’s happening with BB.*

BB is not a fling. It’s not based on a squeeze. It’s just a really, really good company that will steadily rise and could have occasional massive pops (consider the 65% increase the day their amzn deal went public).

· EPS: $7.09 vs. $4.72 estimated

· Revenue: $59.7 billion vs. $59.7 billion estimated

· AWS: $7.7 billion vs. $7.7 billion estimated

Let’s look at how the market reacted AH to these earnings:

2016 Q1: +12% 

2017 Q1: +4.7%

2018 Q1: +7%

2019 Q1: +1%

Analysts are predicting an EPS of $6.35 and Revenue of $73 Billion for 2020 Q1

Amazon has exceeded EPS by an average of 81.59 % in Quarter 1 earnings in the last 4 years. Revenue has been beat by an average of 1.91% in Quarter 1 earnings in the last 4 years. The years that had the highest next day movements were the years that had the largest revenue beat. I believe the revenue in this upcoming earnings report will surprise everyone. Amazon, in the past month, has hired an additional 175,000 employees to keep up with the demand. In 2019, Amazon had 798,000 employees. Amazon increased their employee count by 21.9% in one month. There is a direct correlation between revenue and number of employees. The revenue per employee for Amazon in 2018 was $359,671 or $89,917.8 per quarter ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/217489/revenue-per-employee-of-selected-tech-companies/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/217489/revenue-per-employee-of-selected-tech-companies/)). Another source lists it as an additional $75,000 in quarterly net online sales per new hire ([https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazons-175000-worker-hiring-spree-suggests-strong-first-quarter-sales-despite-covid-19-analysts-say-2020-04-27](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazons-175000-worker-hiring-spree-suggests-strong-first-quarter-sales-despite-covid-19-analysts-say-2020-04-27)).

* For those WSBer who failed basic HS civics class, just one GOP win in the two run-off Senate seats will keep Biden's more progressive agenda at bay (and likely the recent tax cut intact) as the GOP and McTurtle retain control of the Senate. Conversely, Dems winning both seats will secure both legislative branch for Dems, as VP Harris be the tie breaking vote in the Senate. Will this mean an eventual bigger stimulus package?

Despite the FY number being ""missed"" by 450 vehicles, the quarterly delivery of 180,570 vehicles handily beat Wall Street's estimate of about 174k vehicles and shares are up bigly to close up 3.42% at $729.77. How did we ever doubt those WSB degens who loaded up $3,500 strike Jan 15 calls pre-split which are now ITM!? Truly, they were ahead of the times in knowing that TSLA will shoot up an additional 76% in the next 3 months.

*  On Chinese EV side of things, NIO delivered 7k vehicles in Dec 2020 while XPEV delivered 5,700 vehicles - both numbers are record ""growth"" for the two company which shows a YoY growth of 121% for NIO and 326% for XPEV. (WSB with OTM FDs know these ""growth"" well as their FDs goes from 100% in value but are still down all-time of at -85%). NIO closed the day up 9.75% to $53.49 and XPEV trimmed their intraday high of 10%+ to close up 2.97% at $44.10.

*  In WSB meme stock land, things are a fairly mixed bag as GME continues to fade after reaching a recent 52-week high of $22.35. The definitely-not-going-bankrupt gaming retailer closed the day down -8.44% to $17.25. PLTR, despite being up more than 2% in pre-market, closed the day relatively flat at -0.76% to $23.37. Finally, steel gang got a respite today as MT closed the day up 4.59%, though intraday high was up as much as 8%.

*  Looking for cheap and relatively ""responsible"" WSB meme stock play? You can do GME covered call and sell April 35c for about $1.6 (though selling on a green day for $2+ is probably a better idea). This will net you 100 shares of GME for less than $15.70 per share and cap your imaginary gains at $35 if the squeeze does happen. (All those GME DDs can't be wrong?)  Conversely, you can go with GME April 20c/35c debit call spread for a ""low price"" of $2.4 per spread, or for those who prefer to sell FDs to fellow WSBer, poor man's covered call of Jan 2022 $25c and selling weeklies and/or April 35c will suffice. At the end of the day, the fact that April 35c has so much value still to it should be taken advantage if GME has a green day. For MT, June debit call spread is probably the way to go, with 25c/35c a possible spread. These are not financial advice and if you listen to a random stranger online and lose your pants on the play - then that's on you, you dumb stupid motherfucker.

*  DJI closed down -382 pts (-1.25%), IXIC closed down -189 pts (-1.47%), SPX -55 pts (-1.48%), and RUT is down -28 pts (-1.47%). Notable numbers and ERs this week: ISM manufacturing index tomorrow at 10 AM ET, BBBY reports on Thursday before market opens while MU reports after market close. Load up on those MU 90c for 7/20 - this time it'll definitely hit!
