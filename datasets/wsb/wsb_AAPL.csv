2021-03-09 11:51:34,Why you need to take a serious look at $AAPL before the March 23rd rumored event.,"$AAPL has been my 2nd largest earning stock in the past 12 months only dethroned by a quick stint with $GME. I closed all of my positions with $AAPL while the market was in decline and now I'm going to be going back in full force.  


The first major item here is the news that there may be a virtual event on March 23rd (this is why I'll be looking at picking up some March 26th expiration calls that are close to ATM).

&#x200B;

1. Rumor of an [Apple](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/08/apple-event-march-23-kang/) even on March 23rd, some items that may be coming:
   1. [AirTags](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/) \- not that exciting, just their version of Tile
   2. [AirPods](https://9to5mac.com/2020/01/15/60-million-airpods-sold-in-2019/) \- Apple has sold 60 million of these in 2019....that's 71% of true wireless headphone revenue
   3. Potential for new Mac / iPad updates. The iMac Pro has been discontinued so it's possible they make an announcement around a Mac product here.

Company Fundamentals:

* From the above you'll see they have a commanding share of the true wireless headphone market. Any additional updates to the AirPods would be a great revenue generator. As much as people roasted the over the ear AirPods max...they're sold out everywhere and people were paying 2x the price to get them off eBay.
* Looking below there is a steady increase in revenue from the iPad, Mac...and significant growth from ""other"" which would be your AirPods, and other accessories.

For those of you who understand how the 10yr relates to equity markets and how inflation = bad news for Apple...It's trading at an attractive P/E right now compared to other companies. It has a lower P/E than Microsoft, Amazon, NVIDIA, Adobe etc.

https://preview.redd.it/cfh8d1qw32m61.png?width=2846&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3a0c4692e6c980db9f6d851249503bb4e14cd4e

They had their best earnings report ever last quarter, and the stock dropped after, and continued to do so from $140's down to a low of $116 yesterday.

Apple is below it's price it entered 2021 at, which to me flashes a huge buy sign as this is oversold. While tech might not have growth like it did in 2021, and just because $AAPL has mountains of cash, I don't think any pending inflation fears should sway anyone away from thinking this is as blue chip as you can get.

After a nearly 2 month long downtrend, we are seeing an opportunity to breakout here.    
Great movement today from AAPL, a strong green candle with no top wick is just what we needed to see to regain hope.

2021-01-30 10:28:50,Some AAPL DD for you retards,"Alright retards and autists, listen up. AAPL earnings were last week and they were spectacular, sales up 21% YOY, SMASHED 100 billion in revenue in one quarter for the first time ever at 111.4 billion, sales in all product categories are up double digit percentage points and bassicaly crushed the revenue estimates for every one of their product categories aside from being under by 0.01% for mac revenue (mac revenue still up 21% YOY). Earnings per share were at $1.68 vs the estimated $1.41. It's also important to note that sales in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan are up 57%.

But what happened? You ask, like a wide eyed retard fresh outta mommies cunt. We've all seen this shit before, blowout earning report and a steep sell off straight afterwards. It's why only the retardiest of retards play earnings. They almost always recover after said sell off and If you look at the chart, apple is prime for a swift recovery judging by the Extremely bullish Batman throwing a batarang pattern that developed in the last few hours on friday.

https://imgur.com/gallery/KCjZdbZ

The reason I believe the recovery will be swift is because this sell off was almost certainly caused by a few big funds needing liquidity to cover their GME shorts + short more GME. Also autists liquidating their positions to buy more gme. This dip will be bought right back up by institutions that have no interest in GME.

TLDR; AAPL going back over 140 by the end of next week cuz I said so.

2021-02-22 09:27:42,AAPL a Day Keeps the Stonk Doctor Away,"**TLDR: AAPL is a low volatility play with a huge speculative upside, meaning tickets are cheap for the next rocket to Planet Tendies** 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

Tomorrow, 23 February 2021 is the annual shareholders meeting. This is a good time to take a look at the ""Apple of my eye"", AAPL. Note, this is not an earnings report, but a shareholder meeting. More on that below.


**Upside:**

iPhone Sales - For the first time since 2016, Apple is #1 global smart phone sales. That means Apple has retaken their crown as the smartphone king. And this is all before 5G really takes over. I anticipate Apple iPhone sales to continue to perform well as 5G is rolled out globally. Strong smart phone sales continue to cement Apple as a very stable company, and situates them very well to continue expanding into other areas (hint hint Electric Vehicles).

Low volatility - considering the annual shareholder meeting is tomorrow, I am surprised to see that historic volatility is currently only 10%. This means options are relatively cheap. In my opinion this opens the door for a speculative play here, where we can see call options increase in price due to delta (AAPL stonk price increasing, which has historically performed very strongly) as well as IV (volatility) increase due to speculation. Apple thus far has been relatively quiet on their future plans, and I believe if they hint at any information tomorrow during their shareholder meeting or in the near term, we will be eating tendies 🚀 🚀 🚀

https://amp.ft.com/content/ee13ada3-a66a-4b3a-9def-bb308a800941


**Downside:**

Lawsuit with Epic Games - This is still pending, and currently Epic Games filed a lawsuit against Apple in the EU for ""anti-trust"" reasons related to mobile games and the iOS app store. I am not a lawyer and don't claim to understand what's going on, so I can't speculate on what this would do to the stonk price. It's something to keep in mind when considering your risk tolerance. Historically though it doesn't seem like anti-trust lawsuits have seemed to stop anyone, but I am open to other's thoughts here.


**Electric Vehicle (EV) Speculative Play:** 🚀 🚀 🚀

In my opinion, this is where the largest tendies will come from. There may be a huge speculative play here and I believe the combination of Apple being quiet on the topic while they work on the details (as per their normal playbook) as well as a general market sell off in response to recent market volatility (i.e. funds are selling off their AAPL to shift their gains to other areas to fight the market volatility), means we have a lower price AAPL stonk than I believe it should be. Basically, hedge funds are busy fighting in other areas of the market and can't allocate capital to speculate on Apple and are instead busy fighting the day to day fight in other stonks (GME?).

The Electric Vehicle (EV) play - there have been reports of Apple looking for an EV partner in 2021, and my opinion is I expect news on Apple's EV play over the next 3-6 months, if not during annual shareholder meeting tomorrow. 🚀 🚀 🚀

Of note, Foxconn which is Apples main chip producer, is releasing their own EV (independent of Apple) by EOY. In my view point, this means a major Apple partner who they have an extensive business relationship with already has the infrastructure and equipment in place to support an Apple EV play.

Most recently, Apple has been in early talks with car producers Kia as well as Hyundai. While nothing is official, this is evidence that Apple is exploring the EV market.

But keep in mind, Apple is a technology company so they can provide a car manufacturer partner with EV technology using their top computer science talent. Using existing skill sets and projects already in development, Apple can provide operating systems, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning, self driving technology, LiDAR sensors, etc. to the EV space. In my opinion this makes Apple a speculative EV play.


**Financials:**

Sales grew a whopping 72% ($111.5B) in the previous quarter. They spent $5B last quarter on R&D alone. They reported a free cash flow of $73B in 2020 so they’re more than financially capable to pivot in the EV field. I point these numbers out as a reminder of how financially sound Apple is, which in my mind reduces the downside risk of any AAPL plays.

In 2020 the board of directors had a target goal of $265B in net sales and they hit $274B. The operating income target was $61B and they hit $66B. Clearly this board of directors knows how to get results and meet targets.

Furthermore, Free cash flow growth last quarter was 87% or $35B. That’s wild. Apple has the cash on hand to make any EV move they would like to


**What’s happening at the shareholder meeting:**

- Electing directors: reelecting to the Board of Directors: James Bell, Tim Cook, **Al Gore**, Andrea Jung, Art Levinson, Monica Lozano, Ron Sugar, and Sue Wagner;

- Independent accounting firm for auditing

- Advisory vote on executive compensation

- Adding a new shareholder nominated director position (increase from 1 to 2)

- Improve executive compensation program (director’s pay ratio is over 400 to 1 of the average employee)

- Questions and answers by Tim Cook. Will they speculate on the EV play? I believe that any hint of EV will send AAPL price skyrocketing 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀


**Price point:**

$175 base, $225 bull over the next months to EOY


**Positions:**

16 April $125/$130/$133.75 calls, 22 Jan $125 calls


**TLDR: AAPL is a low volatility play with a huge speculative upside, meaning tickets are cheap for the next rocket to Planet Tendies** 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀


**Bonus:**

Al Gore aka man bear pig is a director on the board for Apple.

https://images.app.goo.gl/En2pYet7C5fTUUpS7

The creators of the internet argue that Gore was “the first political leader to recognize the importance of the internet and to promote and support its development.” Clearly Al Gore saw the importance of the internet, and with EV being an environmentally green initiative, I believe he would see the importance of EV. If not developing their own electric vehicle, at the very least providing software/products for other EV players.

2021-02-03 09:13:13,DD $GOEV / Canoo's potential AAPL Partnership with a side of short squeeze 🚀,"First I want to congratulate us on breaking 8 million degenerates. I have been posting on this sub for over 3 years back when we were at only a couple hundred thousand. This is my first DD write up and I’m a little retarded so please go easy on me. 

For everyone who doesn’t want to read a wall of text there’s a **TL:DR** at the bottom.

**Technical Setup:**

Canoo has completed its SPAC merger and ticker change a little over a month ago going from HCAC to GOEV. Ever since the combination it has been piled into by shorts. The short position has grown exponentially from 99k shares to over 10 million as of the last update by NASDAQ. I subscribe to S3 Capital’s retail short algorithm which gives a more accurate current estimate of ~11 million shares short. New available shorts are nearly nonexistent and borrow rates are sky rocketing. If you haven’t been living under a rock the past couple of weeks you already know how well short squeezes can play out. 

[S3 short Info](https://imgur.com/RPVpzbu)

[NASDAQ Short Info](https://imgur.com/LrjJJCD)

[Share Borrow & Fees](https://imgur.com/esZFBfL)

**Fundamental Setup:**

GOEV has a ton of positive catalyst the shorts are overlooking and I believe this will lead to large losses on their side. For one, the EV revolution is here to stay as you can tell from the new administration. Biden plans to electrify the whole federal fleet (estimated 650k vehicles). GOEV  has the perfect mid sized commercial B2B purpose built vehicle which fits the build of many government vehicles. The Canoo purpose built vehicle can replace for example USPS mail trucks.

[MPDV Purpose Built Vehicle](https://www.canoo.com/mpdv/) 

Canoo’s leadership are veterans in the automotive industry which is hard to say for some of the other SPAC *cough * NKLA. Canoo's co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was CTO at EV carmaker Faraday Future and more importantly has over 30 years of management experience at BMW. He worked to reimagine the MINI brand, develop the company's first SUV, and the iProject (BMW i8 & i3). They also poached talent from Tesla; Sohel Merchant (vehicle architecture) Christoph Kuttner (vehicle trim), and Alexi Charbonneau (proprietary EV skateboard tech) just to name a few. 

The real value here is their proprietary B2B skateboard platform for EVs. Allowing for any automaker to design and build their perfect sedan and just clip on to an already existing powertrain. Now AAPL is most likely going to sign an EV production contract with Hyundai/KIA (expected as soon as Feb 17th) confirmed last night by the  3.6 Billion investment. GOEV is already providing their platform to Hyundai/KIA. GOEV has already been validated by AAPL as in AAPL wanted to buy them out in 2020 so clearly they like their tech. And if you think that’s not enough to sell you on this theory then listen to this: In 2015, Apple almost used the BMW i3 as the basis for its Apple Car… the two founders of Canoo were the top guys on the iProject. It doesn’t take a genius to connect these dots.

2021-03-04 16:47:16,Tech stocks being in a bubble is a lie. Don't let TSLA and AAPL fool you,"I am not going to do the homework for you guys. Just go to any financial statistics website and look at the PE ratio of the majority of the stocks inside ETFS like QQQ. Their PE ratio and net revenue / cash flow to stock prices are not actually up but either stable or slightly lower. The only exception to this rule are meme stocks like TSLA, GME etc. AAPL is an exception too but AAPL's net revenue is quickly catching up. But ETFs and tech stock market in general are not in a bubble, you are looking at less than a handful of stocks to make this determination.

You guys are also forgetting that we are currently undergoing a technology revolution like never before. Covid-19 put technology in the forefront and it's like the invention of the steam engine right now. Everything in tech and the cyberspace in particular is literally going to skyrocket in the upcoming years. People who are going full time in right now will be the winners and history will know it. Jury is out for if these meme stocks are overvalued too because we don't know their future potential (TSLA, NIO etc - minority of the tech stocks). What is happening right now is that safe money is moving out of stocks and either into bonds or cash. Because of inflation cash is going to take a huge hit in a year or so when we finally have the figures for how much Covid-19 cost us in American dollars. So not only will people miss out on the huge gains post-tech revolution but they will also take a big hit for holding cash.

I am not going to say if I am a financial expert or not. It is common sense. But I was never a part of these PLTR, GME and TLRY ponzi schemes. These people are worse than the hedge funds because they are just as greedy but far less educated / invested. It was a pyramid scheme where the first guy in took the most gains. I don't believe in something like a store that sells physical copies of video games to ever succeed rofl. Let's not forget Gamestop offering $3 for a game they would later sell for $40. All you bozos did was bail out the assholes that were invested in an asshole company and had poor retail investors take the hit for it. You people took advantage of depressed anxious jobless individuals and now many of them are left without much. I took a big hit from TSLA too (silly me). But I do believe in the cyberspace taking off big time in the upcoming years and it'd be the most valuable resource imaginable. You are seeing news right now about tech stocks being in a bubble over and over. You are also seeing news about some bond bullshit going up. It's the news that wants you to get out so the big whales can go in cheap - right before Biden administration goes all in on the clean energy and tech sector. Tech in the 1990s was nothing like it is now. India and China did not know what computers were back then, now every person has an iphone and tiktok in their hands. Cars are running on cyberspace/cloud that did not exist back then. Revenue of tech companies dwarfes the oil giants. Currency itself is produced using technology (Cryptos). Globalism / latest tech and the cloud itself has become the most valuable resource not just in America but also in India and China which have 10x our population. Instead of going to war for oil now we are spreading peace for likes.",9,0.53

Sell AAPL, buy NOK!","*Kevin Moody*, a roofer from **Ellesmere Port**, has recently cleared out his ‘man draw’ looking for a key to the shed when he stumbled upon his old *Nokia 3310* mobile phone. The phone was still switched on, and had been forgotten about for 20 years.

Incredibly the phone still had just over 70% battery remaining. Kevin remarked how he didn’t ever remember charging the mobile, or even owning a charger.

Today’s mobile phones, such as iPhones, have an average battery life of around 17 minutes and require plugging in throughout the day in order to have enough power for the bus or train ride home. The Nokia 3310, however, never required charging. Ever.

Scientists believe that Nokia, rather than make a mobile phone, had instead created renewable energy.

Doctor *Ivor Bignob*, currently teaching at Cheshire College, commented:

>*THE NOKIA 3310 BATTERY IS LIKE PERPETUAL MOTION. IT SHOULDN’T EXIST, BUT IT DOES. ONE NOKIA 3310 CAN POWER A CITY FOR ALL TIME.*

Conspiracy theorists believe the Nokia 3310 disappeared because of threats and underhand tactics from fossil fuels, as a battery that never ran out would cripple the fossil fuel industry.

Mr Moody’s phone is currently serving him well as both a texting device and a spare hammer for when he drops his at work.

2021-02-16 07:59:47,Weekly Stock Market News | TLRY / PLTR / TSLA / DIS / AAPL / GM & other Stock Market News [02-16],"**The stock market finished another great week at record highs. Investors turn even more bullish with semiconductors & pot skyrocketing. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of last week, as we saw all 3 major indexes finish at all time highs with the [Dow Jones](https://imgur.com/9QkK5ca) gaining 1% for the week, while the [SP500](https://imgur.com/o3g9vaq) rose by 1.2% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://imgur.com/TMdS1Ly) outperformed rising 1.7%, as 8 of the 11 [sectors](https://imgur.com/VejvtiI) finished the week with gains, with Utilities and Consumer Discretionary losing over 1%, but it’s important to note that the Volatility [Index](https://imgur.com/qFVLzd6) also closed at the lowest level in almost a year, as it closed under 20 on Friday.

[HERE](https://imgur.com/cvTchF7) is the HEAT MAP from last week, that shows pretty mixed results, with semiconductors & financials popping while the rest of the stock market had mixed results.

We also saw some interest economic data last week, as the TD Ameritrade January [Index](https://imgur.com/V78bPVC) came in at 6.91, up over 10% over December as most retail investors bought Apple, AMD & AT&T. The other interesting number that we received was the investor sentiment [survey](https://imgur.com/Pi3tk6d), which showed what I was expecting, as it came in with a more bullish view of the retail investors as I predicted last week, which is one thing to look at as a contrarian indicator, so right now, I’m not really adding anything to my portfolio, but I am still gathering some cash for the next correction/pullback.

In terms of Job numbers, we saw Job [Openings](https://imgur.com/URoCI4p) in December coming in slightly better than expectations as the job opening rate stood at 4.5% while the jobless [claims](https://imgur.com/Ouf4H1d) came in down almost 20k vs last week but was higher than expected by analyst as the number of continuing jobless claim grew by over 50K.

This [week](https://imgur.com/1foTccl) is pretty quiet in term of economic data, with only jobless claims and some preliminary numbers of the PMIs while on the [earnings](https://imgur.com/rySV2ud) front, we do have a couple of interesting ones left with names like Shopify, Fastly, Roku, Walmart, Fiverr & many others reporting.

In some other stock market news, we saw pot stocks torching the market towards new highs in the beginning of the week, only to [crumble](https://imgur.com/TNZOw4X) on Thursday, but still, most of the stocks managed to finish the week with very big gains. We can see that the [ETF](https://imgur.com/XgntUvu) for these stocks has crushed the markets and has almost doubled already this year. This hole spike started after Tilray announced an agreement with Grow Pharma for a [deal](https://imgur.com/TuznO0z) in the UK and of [course](https://imgur.com/21Lt9F2) the “chatter” on Reddit’s biggest stock market forum. And by the way, it’s still interesting to watch the Aphria/Tilray merger developments, to see if either Aphria spikes again, or if Tilray goes down to counteract the current 30% discount on the merger.

Meanwhile, despite popping on Monday after a [new](https://imgur.com/xwv5lEU) partnership with IBM which will be available starting in March, Palantir finished the week more than 5%, ahead of the Q4 earnings results that will be announced this morning, and should be interesting to watch if they sustain the huge rise of the stock in the past months. (Later edit: PLTR beat on revenue but posted an unexpected loss of $0.06/share)

We also saw numbers from Tesla’s China [sales](https://imgur.com/fc8gduC), which more than doubled in 2020 and now stand at 21% of their total sales at almost $7B, as the model 3 was the best-selling electric car in China in 2020. Tesla also slumped last [week](https://imgur.com/KNzzLHK), despite popping on Monday after the disclosure of $1.5B in digital currency assets bought in January, as more [analysts](https://imgur.com/eMxGtXU) are pointing to a potential battery cell supply shortage in the future for EV companies.

Regarding earnings reports, there were a couple of interesting one’s last week, with Disney [posting](https://imgur.com/4x7GFjt) a surprise profit of $0.32 and beating on revenues, as Disney+ subscribers are nearing the 100M mark, while the current total direct-to-consumer subs stand at 146M. This helped the company return to profitability after just one quarter of negative [results](https://imgur.com/kvEjJN3), which is incredible given the big hit taken by the rest of their revenue streams.

Apple also had an interesting week after [reports](https://imgur.com/wHUEKv9) that they are not in talks with Hyundai, Kia on developing a self-driving electric car, while JP Morgan [speculated](https://imgur.com/UX2MvzG) they might partner with Renault, and pointed to a couple of interesting things, like Renault’s 1million units of excess capacity, their track record with contract manufacturing and the flexibility this might give Apple to having a bigger input on the manufacturing process. It’s also to be noted that this could be a nice synergy for them, as Renault & Nissan have struggled with their EV products, so this could provide a big presence across key regions for both of the companies, while also offering premium products, as Apple pretty much stands for premium offerings. Though, it’s still very [unclear](https://imgur.com/IYjOfBX) which way Apple will go, but it’s pretty safe to say, they are definetly moving forward with this project.

Also, regarding earnings reports we did have a couple of interesting ones, as the recent green energy favorite, [Enphase](https://imgur.com/tvpnxk0) beat expectations by $0.11, as the stock popped on better-than-expected guidance for the next quarter.

We also saw [Twitter](https://imgur.com/KQb4ClB) beating expectations for the quarter on the top and bottom line, but disappointed on monetizable daily users which came in 1.5M lower than expected, though this didn’t stop the stock to pop to new highs at over $70.

Meanwhile, [GM](https://imgur.com/Yk0tdaK) also posted great beats on the earnings report as the company showcased an EBIT 20% beat than expected, but this didn’t help the stock as it sold off after the report that it may also be high be the global chip shortage, as this has made big companies like [NVIDIA](https://imgur.com/oVFjne0) to bring back older products to meet the insane demand for semiconductors.

One last piece of news for the week was that Qualcomm unveiled their [new](https://imgur.com/vrKYXlS) 5G modem to compete in this new 5G rush, while also [objecting](https://imgur.com/9epoJGz) to NVIDIA possible ARM acquisition, as this could possibly limit other chipmakers accessing the intellectual property possessed by ARM, as this is used in 95% of the world’s smartphones.

So, let’s hope for a good week in the stock markets again, as we have to keep an eye on what big companies like Walmart & Shopify announce later in the week.

2021-01-09 13:56:55,AAPL Earnings DD and iPhone 12 Sales Estimates,"TLDR: My autistic senses say Apple will beat earnings bigly on strong iPhone sales and higher av. selling price. AAPL calls for Jan 29 - March on any strikes above 130 will print

Positions: AAPL 132c 2/5

https://preview.redd.it/2pzvjv51gca61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3ec55f5d2209e731ffad991bf518f2c1e4fcec1

Over the last two weeks a few reports and FinNews articles have come out expecting strong iPhone sales for Q4 earnings. A strong quarter is expected with the first 5G iPhones and pent up consumer discretionary spending. Any retard could have predicted that but I believe that analyst estimates are low and more importantly is not priced in at $129-133. 

A few articles from shills and morons below

[Bezinga: IPHONE 12 SALES ARE 21% BETTER THAN THE IPHONE 11](https://www.gizchina.com/2020/12/29/iphone-12-sales-are-21-better-than-the-iphone-11/)

[Bloomberg: Supply Chain Sends Bullish Signal on 5g After Tepid Start](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-05/iphone-supply-chain-sends-bullish-signal-on-5g-after-tepid-start)

I did my own due diligence in November and December to figure out how many iPhones they were actually selling. Apple's suppliers posted Q4 [record earnings](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/08/tsmc-sees-record-breaking-earnings-from-iphone-12-demand) signaling higher production levels than past cycles and analysts report Apple produced 79 million 5g units in Q4 and another 210 million units for FY2021.

 Analysts expect a[38% increase](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/22/apples-iphone-12-shipments-set-for-38-annual-growth-in-q1-2021) in units shipped for Q1 2021 and a similar increase for Q4 sales. Additionally the average price of each iPhone sold is expected to be higher than past years (typically around $750.) The model lineup this year is more expensive on average and analysts speculate flagship models iPhone 12, 12 Pro and Max make up the majority of increased sales. 

Additionally sales in Chinese markets are expected to rise Apple market share past the 20% threshold they've been stuck at. 

Using availability data from the Apple website, I found that base iPhone 12 models in any color were sold out (unavailable for in-store pickup) in 80% of Apple stores by the end of December after holiday sales. This isn't an exact count but does suggest that inventories of iPhone 12 models are low even for the commonly purchased base storage models.

https://preview.redd.it/quqwmg5mmda61.png?width=1760&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e3607de4af73989b6e35274c26bf82fd1a68dad

 Analyst estimates are almost surely correct and may be on the low side if inventories are as low as they look. Additionally the stock has priced in expected lower sales numbers due to a delayed launch date and production holdups. AAPL is still trading below ATH from September when reports came out regarding delayed launches. I believe that Q4 sales will beat significantly  and  since the launch was delayed, demand in Q1 will be greater and guidance for the quarter will be increased during the earnings call. 

**Positions**

\\We've been sitting at $128-132 for the last two weeks but I have a target price of $142 for post earnings through early March. AAPL is $2.22 trillion behemoth so significant price changes are difficult but the IV on options is low enough (42%) to be worthwhile.

 I have already committed the remainder of my options account to this play. I picked up $132c 2/5 on Wednesdays dip but any calls $130+ exp after earnings are a very viable and potentially lucrative play. 

If you buy puts fuck you.

On top of that I just have that autistic little feeling about this play. Felt that way about longing TVIX in February 2018 which was a 10 bagger and Palantir at $9. Being such an autist, I'm not so good with words but I like my numbers and they check out. And lets face it, you've yolo'ed on more retarded DD before.

2021-01-25 04:56:34,Stock Market News for Today | PLTR / GM / AAPL / TSLA / FB / MSFT & Other Stock Market News [01-25],"**Stocks close out the week with big gains, as Big Tech comes back in flavor. The earnings frenzy starts with Apple, Tesla, Facebook & Microsoft reporting. GameStop, GM & Ford spiked last week, let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of Friday as we saw most of the stock market giving up some of the big gains of the week, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/ZxdGSkm) losing .30% & the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/MRn5Q40) Industrial dropping 179 points while the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/F3wm2d8) barely managed to post a small gain for the day as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/JRkwsZn) ticking up a little but finishing under 22 for the week, with the Nasdaq gaining 4.2% in the short week the SP500 rising 1.9% and the Dow Jones posting a .6% gain.

About 55% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/hFF1hSm) were advancing on below average volume as the number of companies moving above the moving averages still remains very high. We only saw 3 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/pPJpQCk) posting small gains for the day while the biggest losers were the value play in Financials, Energy and Industrials, all losing more than .50%

For the week we saw communications outperform with a big spike after Netflix reported earnings, while Energy had more than one ugly day dropping big on Monday, Thursday and Friday.

Small-caps faired better to close out the [week](https://ibb.co/y0C39gJ), with all 3 groups posting gains of more than 1.5% while Large-Cap Value companies underperformed losing more than 2.5% for the week, as Growth Companies & Especially the big-caps finally outperformed this week, gaining 2.3%.

Here is the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/MnWSRV4), which was a pretty mixed bag, with Apple posting a big gain ahead of the earnings report while the other big tech companies also posted small-gains. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/BfYRHWS) though, we saw huge gains in most of the big tech names with all the FAANG names and Microsoft gaining more than 5% for the week, while Banks alongside Oil & Gas companies were the biggest losers

We also got some economic data on Friday as existing home [sales](https://ibb.co/KWxRW9m) rose again while the inventory is still at all time-lows of under 2 months of supply while the January [PMI](https://ibb.co/x54dqCy) current read came in at 58, way above the 55.5 expected and 55.3 in the previous read as both the Services and Manufacturing PMI saw a spike of more than 2 points

This week we also start the [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/2nsRvBx) frenzy, with AMD which might benefit from Intel’s drop last week, Microsoft & Starbucks reporting after Tuesday’s close as JNJ might also give some updates regarding their vaccine, while big value companies like Boeing, AT&T & Caterpillar report before the open on Wednesday & Friday. We also have some of the big tech names reporting on the same day, with Apple which is expected to have their first $100B quarter, Tesla & Facebook reporting after Wednesday’s close which might be a bigger volatility moment for the market depending on how the results come in.

In terms of economic [data](https://ibb.co/Fx6TWyw), we start off [today](https://ibb.co/4K4DDvp) with the Dallas FED Manufacturing survey but the most interesting ones are on Thursday & Friday, while we also wait to see what the FED announces in terms keeping the rates low & the money printer going with asset buying on Wednesday.

In some other stock market, we saw [Palantir](https://ibb.co/zV2vxft) soar on Friday, rising more than 25% to break the $30 levels after they updated their Demo Day scheduled for tomorrow. It’s expected that they will reveal the latest developments in their big software platforms and also reveal [new](https://ibb.co/swYH61R) software platforms that will continue to help the company grow such as SDDI, Low-Code/No-Code and other modular strategy software.

We also saw [Ford](https://ibb.co/D8cmmZn) soaring again, as the company is having the best monthly performance in more than 10 years and spiked more than 6% after JP Morgan upgraded the company based on their new product line which is what I’ve been saying about the company in some months now. Tesla is going to face serious competition in the next decade with all the other car manufactures pushing harder and harder into the EV world, with some of the most popular cars out there like the F150, the Bronco and other models joining the sector that will continue to improve and might actually become a good alternative to Tesla’s models. It’s the same with others like [GM](https://ibb.co/42G3ttK) which might be a good catch-up play compared to Tesla. By the way… [GM](https://ibb.co/vPwbPCs) is outperforming Tesla recently based on their developments in the EV & self-driving sector.

Meanwhile, [GME](https://ibb.co/bXYsj4k) had a wild day on Friday, gaining more than 50% despite being even higher as the battle between WSB & the shorts continues, with this move making Citron’s Left deciding to avoid further talks about the company probably in an attempt to avoid future attention at the GameStop short squeeze. Short Squeeze has seen a big rise in terms of [search](https://ibb.co/qn51BPH) interest after these latest moves in the GameStop stock and might even put more pressure on the bears, as retail investors might run up this stock even more.

So, guys, this week might bring a lot of volatility depending on many of the important events we have. Earnings seasons & especially big tech results will be important to justify these high multiples most of the tech names have received, while we also have to see how the GDP comes in, as it is expected to have seen a 4% growth for the 4th quarter while the FED is under pressure to keep the money printer on and the rates low, if not, or if there is any doubt in their commitments and also some numbers come in worse than expected we might see the long-awaited correction/pullback. But I don’t think numbers or the FED are going to disappoint really, but that doesn’t exclude the possibility of the pullback… keep investing safely & have some money available to buy the dips if they appear, use them as a buying opportunity, not a panic sell.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/929L2rz) are pointing to a very good open, with the Nasdaq leading the way up almost 1%

2020-12-30 02:27:50,Apple Stock Price Predictions | Buy or Sell AAPL? Apple [AAPL] Stock Price Target & Analysis Stocks,"**Should You buy Apple stock or has the company run out of growth opportunities? What is my price prediction for Apple in the next years? Read until the end as I reveal my price target for Apple and also what I think will happen in the next couple of days, weeks & months!**

**\~ Warning! Very Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone! So, let’s go over some of the latest news on Apple before moving on to some fundamental and technical analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock in the next years.

So, let’s start with the [news](https://postimg.cc/Xrkwk6rP) that Apple will cut the App Store commission in half for small app developers starting in the next days, this will impact developers who earn less than $1M annually from the App Store Sales. This is likely to lead to a small decline in commission revenues for Apple as around 98% of the app developers will qualify for this tax reduction from 30% to 15%, but all these small developers only contribute to about 5% of the estimated $50B in annual revenues from the App Store, so that would be only a $1.25B loss for the company, that is less than half a % of the company’s total net sales in the last fiscal year.

Also, these changes may lead to a potential long-term revenue boost, as it is likely this will lead to an increasing creation of apps which will generate more commissions in return.

Alongside this we also saw the company releasing the new MacBook’s with their first in-house [chip](https://postimg.cc/vc39NF7x), which promises faster video and imaging processing [times](https://postimg.cc/CR5Fmj5V), with both [CPU](https://postimg.cc/Y4yLdrMd) and [GPU](https://postimg.cc/xJz8gLsd) performance up to 2 times faster than the latest PC laptop chip using just a fraction of the power consumption, with both of the macbooks promising big improvements in [battery](https://postimg.cc/1fp6y1rz) life. Apple is also [expected](https://postimg.cc/GHrtJ8vc) to roll out even more in-house chips in future products, as they have started the 2-year breakup with Intel chips.

We also saw Morgan Stanley [upgrading](https://postimg.cc/bZ5qMsSS) their base case to $191 at the end of November, as they have cited record lead times, supply chain forecasts and carriers demand as they expect that the company will sell around 270M iPhone in fiscal year 2021, that’s 50M more than the consensus and almost 30M more than the previous estimate of Morgan Stanley, with an average selling price of 842$, 9% more than the base case, as people tend to chose the more expensive and high tech versions of the lineup in this new 5G cycle.

The 5G super-cycle, which I believe is on the way, and will continue in the next years, as 5G become more available worldwide, could still be the biggest thing coming right away for the company with 5G smartphones [expected](https://postimg.cc/LJptP88f) to surpass 4G sales by 2024, with the average sale price of the 5G phones also coming down, helping them become more popular.

They also [released](https://postimg.cc/PpWhPy31) an update iPad Pro and an all-new iPad Air in September which will also boost sales in this work-from-home environment that will keep the demand very high for this kind of products, just like the Macs. Alongside the increasing demand from the Wearables, Home & Accessories that include Air Pods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, and many more products.

But the biggest reasons I believe Apple is poised for continued growth, is primarily due to its services business, as they start to have more and more services like the Apple ONE [BUNDLE](https://postimg.cc/4777MD3s), which include up to 6 services from (Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, the new Apple Fitness+ and the iCloud service) for a pretty reasonable price in my opinion [starting](https://postimg.cc/BLkDnqzj) from 15$ up to 30$/month, this could be a great option for families and even individuals who use their services a lot.

The latest services, [Fitness+](https://postimg.cc/cKV4KrsG) just launched in the past days, and is a direct competitor to the likes of Peloton, as the service is available on the iPhone, iPad or even Apple TV. This also makes consumers buy the Apple Watch which syncs to the other devices to show you all kinds of information. The Fitness+ app just on its own is 8$/month or 80$/year which is less expensive than Peloton subscription which charges 13$ or even traditional gyms like Planet Fitness at 10$/month.

I think this will be the fastest growing sector for the company, as this aligns with the new macro trends, as the world is moving more and more to a digital approach to almost everything as consumer preferences, with more & more younger people reaching the point in life when they use these services start to align to this increasing digital approach.

We also shouldn’t forget the Apple Card & Apple Pay service among many others which also seem to gain from the move to digital & contactless payments, as this has been accelerated due to the current situation in the past year.

And one last piece of [news](https://postimg.cc/k6BKCVTr), and the most recent one, is that Apple may have fast-tracked the Titan project. The Titan project is targeting a 2024 or 2025 push to develop an electric vehicle with advanced battery technologies, that will deliver significant increases in range at much lower costs than the current technologies while also having self-driving capabilities.

It’s reported they will not use the same technology as Tesla Full-Self-Driving feature, but will use LIDAR sensors, similar to those that we can find in the latest iPhone 12 PRO.

I think Apple can go 2 ways with this project, they can either use the huge amount of cash the company has to buy another car-maker like Ford, GM or any other car manufacturer expect Tesla and Toyota which do have a big market cap, so that they can fast-track the potential manufacturing of cars, or they can enter into a partnership with big companies like Tesla, Volkswagen or any other car marker to either produce cars or license their technology to this other car-makers which would ultimately and probably have higher margin-returns than the actual manufacturing of cars. Apple’s current overall [gross margins](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) stand at 38% vs the 15% average of the world top 10 automakers by market cap, which is significantly lower.

But this Apple Car thing is so long out, and there are so many unknowns, I will not try to predict anything related to this until there is more clarity on the subject.

And last, before moving on to some predictions, here are some of the highlights that we heard from the latest investors conference meeting, as the CEO, Tim Cook [expressed](https://postimg.cc/TyhpLzgg) optimism ahead with the launch of many new products and services, especially the Home Pod Mini and the new 5G iPhones, as these new iPhones include new LIDAR scanners that greatly improve the camera capabilities, as the iPhone as seen very positive reviews. We also saw the Senior VP and CFO, Luca Maestri give us great [outlook](https://postimg.cc/DWDmqxPD) for the company as they expect the installed devices base to continue to growth despite already being at an all-time high as they have over 585M paid subscriptions on their platforms and expect this to surpass 600M by the end of 2020.

I also researched and found what products we can see in the near future, with the first half of [2021](https://postimg.cc/jCBQsXVM) bringing new iMacs, the AirPods3 and the iPad Pro, while in the [FALL](https://postimg.cc/8jVJKngg) event we will probably get the new iPhone 13 alongside the iPhone SE PLUS and the Watch Series 7 with more products coming [later](https://postimg.cc/GHc3s01t) in 2021 or that don’t have an estimated release date like the Air Pods Pro, the Air Tags and the iPad Mini 6.

So, before even starting, you should know that I am bull on Apple but I am willing to hear other opinions so don’t be afraid to leave a comment down below.

I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the [company](https://postimg.cc/JHRDpPGQ), the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research.

This are my 2025 projections for Apple, let’s take a closer look at them, each on their own.

So, in term of revenues, Apple has 5 big sources of revenue, which saw an overall increase of 6% despite lagging sales in the iPhone. The biggest revenue is by a big margin the iPhone right now with over $137B in revenue in the fiscal year ending in September. I expect to see the iPhone sales increasing in the next years, especially in 2021, with the new 5G iPhone creating a super-cycle for the [company](https://postimg.cc/XGfBKT7J), as most iPhone users, including myself here, as I will upgrade from my iPhone X, will switch to this new product. The iPhone sales have decreased in the last couple of years by 14% and 3% as a result of the product not having big improvements, as well as iPhone usually starting to last longer than previous models, so I expect to see a 12% increase in sales next year and a gradual decrease in the growth of sales as more people upgrade, ending with just a 5% growth in iPhone [sales](https://postimg.cc/V0wfRpr7) in 2025.

The next revenues stream is from the Mac, which has seen an increase in the past 2years, with revenues topping $28B this year after the huge demand from the work from home consumers. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/1405tm2b) this trend to continue as they plan to continue to launch better products and I can see the company having a similar growth next year before starting to decline slightly until 2025, also ending with a 5% growth.

The iPad is currently the smallest revenue stream for Apple but has also seen an increase in demand in the past 2 years with a 13% average increase in revenues. I also expect the iPad to continue to grow in the next couple of years, especially with the learn-from-home environment for kids, and even after this period ends, the transformation for learning will implicate more digital usage. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/5XKtVsT0) the iPad to see some similar growth to the Macs, especially with the latest generation also bringing a new iPad air to the market.

The 4th revenue stream and the fastest growing in the past 2 years, with an average growth of 33% are the wearables, home & accessories revenues. This have topped $30B this year, as Apple has also just launched the Apple Watch series 6 and also feature other great products like Apple TV, the Air Pods the Home Pod and the Home Pod mini alongside other third-party accessories.

I gave this [revenue](https://postimg.cc/v4C4JQ4T) stream a growth of 20% starting next year with a gradual decrease to around 8% by 2025, as I believe this will become more & more popular as they start to have more vertical integration.

And last, but by no means least, the revenue stream that I expect to grow the most and the fastest is the revenue from the services that Apple gets. This includes revenues from Apple Care, Advertising, Cloud Services, Payment Services like Apple Card & Apple Pay and of course the digital content which includes fees from the App Store alongside subscription-based revenue including the new Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ alongside the already know Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+ and hopefully I don’t forget any others.

So, I [expect](https://postimg.cc/svV7mDWR) this to become the clear 2nd biggest revenue stream for Apple by 2025, as I expect this to grow more than 20% next year, mainly due to the Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ followed up by a slightly decreasing growth, ending with a 10% increase in revenues in 2025.

I think this are fairly conservative base case scenarios for the revenues, as I expect them to continue to increase the [other](https://postimg.cc/1VFFgkxJ) revenue streams and not have such a large percentage of the revenues coming from the iPhone sales as you can see in this chart.

In terms of expenses, I pretty much kept the same margins as in previous years, with a 68% expense ratio on product sales \[ [iPhone](https://postimg.cc/JDZ7jMnD) / [iPad](https://postimg.cc/Wd14CB9C) / [Mac](https://postimg.cc/q6GkZw2p) / [WHA](https://postimg.cc/211q9q8g) \] and 35% expense ratio on [SERVICES](https://postimg.cc/8sdLLrjH), as this are way more lucrative.

In the past 3 years, the products [gross margin](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) was 32.7%, so I actually imply bigger expenses for the manufacturing and sales of products, as this is mostly impacted by the company’s supplier’s ability to make up for and demand, while for the services revenue, the gross margins for the last 3 years has been 63.5% on average, but I expect this to be more in-line with the 66% margin in this past year. So, if services manage to grow to about half the revenues from the iPhone, this will double the gross revenues, as every buck gained in the service revenues account for 2$ in the product sales.

So, I expect the total [revenues](https://postimg.cc/sMjByQ2n) for Apple to increase from $274B in 2020 to over $440B by 2025, increasing by approximately 10%/year, while I will keep the expense ratio pretty much in-line and have them increasing by 11%/year, this would bring the total gross for Apple to $177B, increasing mainly due to the services revenues as I said earlier. This growth is just above the 4year [average](https://postimg.cc/Tp8g83mS), and below the 2018 levels, which we might see again with this 5G super-cycle and explosive growth in the services revenue.

I also think the company will continue to invest in both Capital Expenditure and Operating expenses.

I think the operating expenses will remain pretty much in line with the [previous](https://postimg.cc/2qBCfrnc) years, as this number has increased by 1% [annually](https://postimg.cc/Fd5JL9v8) both in R&D and SG&A. So, I will keep the exact percentages from previous years, as I expect the revenue to increase, thus I don’t see a big increase percentage wise. This would account for over $60B in operating expenses by 2025 and over $11B in Capital Expenditures by 2025, as I expect this to increase, mainly due to the possible EV developments or investments in self-driving capabilities alongside other manufacturing capabilities. You can see that the Capex [spending](https://postimg.cc/yDsRdpLy) has been decreasing in the past years with just over $8.8B in payments for business acquisitions and the other traditional Capex spending. Some people may use the cash generated by [investing](https://postimg.cc/Mn9nG6Mz) activities as Capex, but that is more unreliable. I also can see the Capex going back up, so I wanted to be safe and implied a 10% growth.

This money would account for over $73B in [expenses](https://postimg.cc/dZnY91K1) and would bring the profit for the company to almost $104B before **I&T**.

Moving on, let’s see what revenue and expenses the [company](https://postimg.cc/cgy0x2ms) has had in the past few years. We can see a decrease in **I** expense in the past few years as the company has been paying debt, but they have also been generating less money in this department, with an overall decrease in this department of more than 50% in the past year, way less than the amount from 2018. So, for safety reasons, I used a 10% decline in both revenues and expenses [related](https://postimg.cc/QKgtZhZG) to **I**, while increasing the other losses by 10%/year.

This would bring the company pre-tax $$$ to just over $104B in 2025.

Let’s move on to taxes. I know the Federal tax rate is 21% for the [company](https://postimg.cc/ykY39pq1), but the actual tax rate for the company was lower than 15% in the past year, mainly due to lower tax-rates on foreign earnings alongside tax-benefits and tax-settlements. The average tax rate has been just over 16% in the past 3 years, but with more and more of the revenues coming from outside the US, I think it’s safe to say that the company will have around a 15% tax rate by 2025, this obviously if nothing major changes in tax policy around the world.

So, Apple would [have](https://postimg.cc/Wqc3ytKw) $88.6B in $$ after tax by 2025 and with the current outstanding shares standing at just under 17B, so I don’t even account for the company probably continuing to do share buybacks, this would mean a $5.22 [future](https://postimg.cc/4YytCLwL) earnings/share. And with today’s price for Apple just around 136$, that would mean to [company](https://postimg.cc/RNf1qH44) is trading at just over 26 times forward price to earnings.

I don’t think Apple will ever trade at a discount again, with the current PE [standing](https://postimg.cc/RqwqHQ6s) at over 40, I believe this will eventually go down, probably to around 35, despite the increase in services revenue, which is highly valued by investors. I think we can see Apple trade somewhere near 35 [times](https://postimg.cc/5H98PKv2) P/E in 2025, especially if something big happens with the EV project, this could be even higher, just look at Tesla which trades at [insane](https://postimg.cc/sBZhxMk5) P/E. Of course, we also have to take into consideration the dividends that will be received from owning the stock, as Apple has started to pay dividends almost a decade ago and has 9 years of dividend growth, with a 10% annual rate of [growth](https://postimg.cc/CnbZMbD2) in the past 5 years. [Here](https://postimg.cc/7CLT1G8C) is the dividend growth history for the company, as I also went conservative on this [estimate](https://postimg.cc/Tp7LcjGr) and implied a 7% growth for the next 2 years, 6% for 2023 and 2024 and just 5% in 2025.

So [here](https://postimg.cc/R3PK21QQ) are my 3 price targets for the company, [including](https://postimg.cc/JHR8JXvv) dividends but not reinvested. My bear case scenario is that Apple will trade at almost 165$ which implies a [return](https://postimg.cc/jCYzWhd2) of over 21% by 2025, while my base case scenario would see Apple trading at 195$ with a return of capital of 43%. I will also make the bull case for Apple trading at 225$ by 2025 with dividends included, which would imply just over 65% in gains by then.

I think this is possible as Apple has also [continued](https://postimg.cc/fJj36jMt) to buy back shares of the company on a constant basis, as they continue to an impressive campaign with over $72B worth of common stock repurchased in 2020. They continue to buy back shares at a very fast pace, having repurchased over 1.3B shares in 2019 and 2018, while also issuing less stock every year.

So here is the full [spreadsheet](https://postimg.cc/Z995KrzL) that I have projected for Apple by 2025 and the breakdown of everything i estimated \[ [1](https://postimg.cc/jCT7qdZJ) / [2](https://postimg.cc/DmcbSkMp) \] , if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.

Keep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just [look](https://postimg.cc/V50nHCSn) at the growth Apple has had in the last 5years. The company has increased in value by more 400% in just the past 5years and is over 100.000% up since it started trading. So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company. So, are you willing to bet against Apple?

The company also has pristine [financials](https://postimg.cc/LYcYMxqf), with more than $65B in total assets compared to total liabilities, and more than $38B in cash and cash equivalents.

So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Apple?

Let’s look at this [CHART](https://postimg.cc/7592T1c8), so starting with the stock split, Apple saw a correction within the September stock market pullback, in a buy the news & sell the event, after a huge runup post-announcement of the stock split. The stock entered a consolidation period, and didn’t have any big catalysts, especially with new iPhone lineup not being included in the Q4 results due to the late launch. The stock found some levels of resistance near the $120 levels that it struggled to get past but acted also as support after breaking them just before the recent news of the possible EV developments or self-driving-features to be licensed to other car manufacturers. After that news the stock spiked and has now reached the previous highs made before the stock split and is facing some resistance, if the stock pushes over $140 I think we can say that it broke the resistance at those levels and is not just a fake-out. But I think it’s likely that the stock will consolidate between 122 and 135$ in the next weeks until the next iPhone sales and quarterly results are released, as the stock has entered overbought territory again with an RSI over 70, the first time since the stock split.

So, what would I do? Well, I own Apple stock, and I would really add on any weakness that the stock shows before the next quarter earnings are released, as typically Q1 [earnings](https://postimg.cc/V5t0FPTF) are the best for the company due to increased holiday sales combined with the launch of new products. I think any entry below 130$ would be really nice to start and build a position or increase it if you already own the stock.

&#x200B;

Evidence to suggest Apple just had a good quarter

\-The iphone 12 (released oct 2020)  had 2 million pre-orders within 24 hours which is massive in comparison to the 800,000 preorders of the iphone 11

\-28.9 billion in sales from macs in 2020 compared to 21.2 billion in 2019 (roughly  25% revenue growth in the sector)

\-iphone 12 sales have outperformed the iphone 11 by 21%

&#x200B;

As far as I can tell as long as you don’t buy short term expiry calls it literally cannot go tits up. Although there is evidence to suggest Apple just had an outstanding quarter lets assume that they only see a share value increase of about 5% (a little below average) by Feb 5. With a 2/19 $130.00 c position you would still net about 25% in gains. With AAPL shares being down recently there’s more room for growth.

Position:

AAPL  2/19 $134.00 c

I’ve been following Apple most of my life. I worked on some of the first hackintosh distros (iatkos) as a broke college student. I can tell you definitively that a massive majority of Apple users are in the digital media and production space. With their prioritization on services the last few years, they’ve really slacked in staying competitive in hardware. They’ve also made some weird plays at being different without actually innovating. That’s changed entirely this year. Their next earnings is going to reflect that. The M1 is a game changer. Almost everyone I know (which is hundreds of people in the digital agency space) have already or are planning on grabbing up Mac mini’s or Airs because of the chip and price point. Apple is also pretty much recession proof. 

My predictions:

- 10% price increase leading up to Q1 earnings just off anticipation.
- 20% price increase post Q1 (probably within a week or two) and pre Q2
- An easy 100% increase by year end.

My play:

Is the workout at home trade done? Intel stops the bleeding while Apple loses lawsuit. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw all 3 big indexes closing the day in the red despite hitting intraday records, with the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/PCN8dwz) losing .38%, while both the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/cDjpNKP) and the [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/RydQj61) Industrial finished the day down just over .2% as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/44wGzR0) rising by more than 4% yesterday as the $2000 stimulus was [BLOCKED](https://ibb.co/WFNSpCH) in the Senate by McConnell and the Georgia Senate runoff election is just a week away.

Almost 70% of the [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/LYM4JfL) were declining yesterday on below average volume as the number of companies that were trading above the 50-day moving average fell under 70% for the first time in quite a while.

We saw 9 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/GRJSmht) closing in the red yesterday, with only the Health Care and Consumer Discretionary sectors having small gains as almost all the types of companies were losing ground [YESTERDAY](https://ibb.co/7tKPyP4), especially the small-caps with the small-cap growth group losing more than 2%.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/KjVsn9X) from yesterday, it’s mostly red, with only a couple of companies that were gaining big like the Chinese companies alongside Amazon and Intel.HEAT

We also got some economic data yesterday, as a review of the 2020 aviation and air travel [ESTIMATED](https://ibb.co/hRbYxpG) that traffic will be down 67% since last year, dropping to levels not seen since 1999, as air travel is still struggling to come back after the march bottoms. This has affected most of the [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/FBq4g37) worldwide but it seems that China airlines is doing somewhat better with the biggest percentage of the total number of flights completed compared to last year.

The SP Home price [INDICES](https://ibb.co/W67RBYh) also came in better than expected with the National Index increasing by 1.4% M/M, as this is a leading measure of real estate prices, gaining 8.4% nationwide over year ago.

These moves can also be seen in the latest Redfin report, as home sales [PRICES](https://ibb.co/CwR5H56) are up 14% year/year to over $320K with a great increase in pending [SALES](https://ibb.co/mJtrwV9) which are also up more than 34% since last year, as the number of active [LISTINGS](https://ibb.co/vVkfMMh) of home sales is down more than 30%, as buyers can’t snatch them up quick enough with such low [YIELDS](https://ibb.co/7j1kY3s), as this has led for the [AVERAGE](https://ibb.co/gzQq8Wb) sale price to list value to rise to 99.4% which Is up 1.5% since 2019. This should be good news for companies like Toll Brothers, Lennar, HD and LOW.

This was also accompanied by the great numbers in the us chain store sales [NUMBERS](https://ibb.co/4PykPcH), which rose by almost 9% y/y with December sales expected to rise almost 5% since last year and a .2% increase since last month.

While [TODAY](https://ibb.co/8N3YMPV) we start the day with MBA Mortgage applications, home sales and the Chicago PMI alongside advance reads on many other data points.

In some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/q1J6Snv), we saw Apple cool of a little yesterday, losing more than 1% for the day while they also lost a lawsuit aimed of stopping Corellium using virtual iPhone for security researching in the operating system, while [INTEL](https://ibb.co/3vvXFGT) finally got a breather and recovered some of the recent loses, after an activist hedge fund manager pushed for strategic changes in the company as Intel is losing market share and top designers, with the company also [ISSUING](https://ibb.co/WgtwTrY) a statement that lifted spirits around the stock.

We also saw the [FAA](https://ibb.co/6rJ6bHd) introduce new rules for drones, this may have a big impact on companies like UPS, Walmart and Amazon, as all of them have started trials for drone-delivery, as this could lead to better margins for the companies.

The Fed also [EXTENDED](https://ibb.co/cxV3HkC) the main street lending programs until Jan. 8 with the approval of Mnuchin as they try to process a bunch of applications this month, this means we can get even more money put into the economy and eventually the stock markets which is good news.

And meanwhile, AstraZeneca’s vaccine was [APPROVED](https://ibb.co/y5QWbmh) for emergency use in the UK, this is another weapon to find this freaking illness, while JNJ will give us some results in early 2021 and Novavax just started their trial in the US.

Also, one last piece of data that I found recently shows that there was indeed a huge spike this [YEAR](https://ibb.co/JrKw01B) in the move to live streaming video and pre-recorded videos this year, as this has boosted companies like Peloton, Lululemon and others.

But this trend is seen slowing down in the next years with just a 4% [CAGR](https://ibb.co/HGhFJXS) in the equipment market, but that the exercise apps will see a big [GROWTH](https://ibb.co/02wm273) in the next years, so there are 2 different POV. I wouldn’t stay invested in companies like PTON right now, I’d rather take profits and move to other areas in the stock market. But don’t rush into companies like which have diluted their stock a lot or have lots of debt… this will not recover so fast...

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/nbV49Bs) seem to be pointing at a good open, with all 3 big indexes in the green as the Nasdaq is leading the way.

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning!

First of all, I wanted to wish everyone a happy new year and hopefully things get better in 2021, and this also brings us at least the great returns that we had in 2020 in the stock market!

So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw all 3 big indexes finish the last full trading day of the year in the green, with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/0cvjjHN) leading the way, up .24% and closing at a new record high, while both the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/QFyd2f6) and the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/B67fT1g) were up just over .1% for the day.

We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/b6Nqf9Z) barely drop yesterday closing just below 23, and with the Georgia runoff election just days away, we can see this going higher if the Democrats win both seats.

We saw almost 70% of the companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/g9CHK9Q) with most of them trading way below average volume as 7 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/LzXDF2P) finished in the green, with Energy & Materials closing the day up more than 1.3% while the biggest loser was the Communications sector, falling almost 0.7%, as we saw the small-cap stocks regain some momentum, [leading](https://ibb.co/yQCFtTZ) the way after they had 2 very bad days to start the week, while the only group that was losing ground yesterday was the large-cap growth sector.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/x5bN7Lk) from yesterday that pretty much sums up the other charts as we can see most big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft and even Apple losing ground for the day, while the biggest gainers were companies like Tesla & TSM alongside the industrial sector and companies like Disney and Mastercard.

Yesterday we also got the investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/7QPXjPV), which for me personally came in pretty mixed, as I use this as a contrarian indicator. This last week we saw 2.5% more investors moving to the bull’s camp, while we also saw almost a 5% increase in bears, as investors become more divided. I think the market is still a little to over bullish and I would avoid to add more money right now, but I wouldn’t get of the stock market either. I think this is a good moment to stay put and wait for more developments overall, but there might still be some good opportunities around in the market and I wouldn’t avoid getting into those.

We also got a lot of economic data yesterday, with a survey for business uncertainty for [December](https://ibb.co/87FMyQ6) showing increasing uncertainty for sales growth but a with a small decline in employment growth expectations.

Meanwhile another number that confirms the investor sentiment survey is the Investor Confidence [Index](https://ibb.co/5952C9Z) which rose by more than 13 points in November, as investors increased the risk appetite for their portfolios.

Alongside this we also saw the November pending home [SALES](https://ibb.co/F8WBXnh) decrease by more than 2.5% month over month, but are still up more than 16% since a year ago, with this monthly decrease mostly coming due to the shortage of inventory.

The Chicago [PMI](https://ibb.co/QF40My3) also came in way better than expected and 59.5 vs 57 expected and up from the 58.2 in the previous month with the biggest movement coming from the employment indicator as it rose to a one year high but is still in contraction territory since 2019.

We also saw the wholesale [inventories](https://ibb.co/fkWmNmc) decrease in November’s advance read while the [retail](https://ibb.co/BBKNrb5) inventories saw an increase of .7%, pretty much in-line with expectations while the trade [balance](https://ibb.co/CKSR070) also saw a surprise decline in the deficit to more than of $84B, $4B worse than the last revision.

[Today](https://ibb.co/D14JGZc) we get initial and continuing jobless claims numbers, alongside the money supply and the FED Balance sheet to end us off for the year.

In some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/GkZgGM1), we saw Fubo sink more than 14% again yesterday after another investing firm announced they have shorted the stock, pointing to the insane valuations of more than $13.000/subscriber.

We also saw a [research](https://ibb.co/QMF5fnG) that indicated some changes in the market share of car companies with Hyundai/Kia having the biggest gains alongside GM, while Nissan saw the biggest decline in market share, mostly due to selling larger & pricier SUVs with cars continuing to see a decline in sales, while the larger vehicles have started to rebound slightly, as all car makers are [bringing](https://ibb.co/kJGkXtz) more & more SUVs and Trucks to the market.

Lockheed Martin also was [awarded](https://ibb.co/bWS5G6j) a new Navy contract worth more than $900M as this might help the company start to get back on track while Mexico will become the world largest legal cannabis market as the Mexican Senate passed a bill in November which is [expected](https://ibb.co/VW3Lqtn) to receive approval in the lower house by February. This is great news for companies in the sector like ACB, Canopy Growth and the future merged company Tilray & Aphria.

Also, one of the biggest active ETFs with over $15B in assets, the [ARK](https://ibb.co/80WJFdW) Innovation ETF saw it’s first daily withdrawal since November, as this hasn’t experienced weekly outflows since early in 2020, this might have been driven by profit taking as this ETF has surged more than 140% this year and also just the ex-dividend date on the 29th, as people expect for the ETF to have a hard time in duplicating the results of this year, which saw it rise on the back of Tesla and Roku with both of them seeing massive increases, with Tesla having more than 7x-ing this year, as that is the biggest holding in the ETF, but who knows we have to wait and see as [TESLA](https://ibb.co/ZzGQgqX) may hit 500K deliveries this year.

And one last piece of [news](https://ibb.co/9bQhB4B) is that Apple did a big purge in their App Store, removing almost 40K game apps as this was the deadline for the developers to submit a government issued license number that enabled users to make in-app purchases. I don’t really think this will have a major impact for the revenues but we will soon find out.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/mvv7tjX) seem to be pointing at a mixed open, with the Nasdaq and the SP500 pointing at a good open while the Dow is slightly down, and with no connection to this, in the UK, the [BREXIT](https://ibb.co/Rh1DYyG) chapter is finally about to close.

2021-01-28 05:11:29,Stock Market News for Today | The Next Stock Market Crash or Buying Opportunity?! AAPL / TSLA [01-28],"**Stocks have their worst day in over 3 months as the short squeeze continues. Apple, Facebook & Tesla report earnings in after hours. Is this the next stock market crash or is it a good buying opportunity? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market have a decently sized pullback having the worst day since late October with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/P1xJx99) losing 2.6%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/1YC8JNG) dropping almost the same while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/wrbybPT) also shed over 600 points as we saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/xYSBQLr) spiking more than 60%, touching levels not seen since before the November elections.

We saw 80% of the companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/7gK9zNR) on huge volumes, as we saw a big correction in companies moving above the 50-day moving average, finally seeing an even split on this metric.

All 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/ph43Ry0) finished in the red, with Communications, Health Care and Consumer Discretionary losing more than 3% for the day as value plays, especially the small ones did a little better [yesterday](https://ibb.co/smbJqbS), while growth companies gave up huge gains from the past weeks.

The [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/wRjjwYH) from yesterday pretty much sums up the stock market movement, with only a few companies posting gains, while massive tech names like Facebook, Tesla, Google, Amazon & Netflix shed more than 2% for the day.

Yesterday we also got the Investor Sentiment [Survey](https://ibb.co/FBLKB9L) which showed an even bigger move for investors to the bearish side, as the number of bears has finally passed the number of bulls after very long time. I think that this sentiment alongside the stock market pullback from yesterday can be a good buying opportunity in some names that were trading at very high levels. I think we can see this sentiment move even more to the bearish side as we get next week’s reporting, with a lot of investors panic selling after the stock market has had a pretty rough week…

So, don’t panic, look for the good companies that have seen a pullback and build your position at a discount, as the [FED](https://ibb.co/gT71WRG) clearly implied yesterday that the money printer will still keep on printing for the foreseeable future, with the FED will keeping the interest rates anchored near 0 and continuing to buy $120B in assets as long as it’s needed for the unemployment levels to go significantly lower and inflation to stand at a 2% average for a sustained period of time.

Meanwhile, in terms of economic data we saw the business uncertainty slipping in [January](https://ibb.co/bd5JNQ2) as both sales growth and employment growth saw a decline from the previous month, while durable goods [growth](https://ibb.co/BtCGhKK) also significantly slowed down in December, though it was the 8th straight month of growth.

In some other stock market news, we continued to see the short squeeze on a very large number of stocks, this might have pushed the markets into sell-off mode as the recent squeeze pushed fund & money managers to cover some of their positions, thus, having to sell off other assets. [Ameritrade](https://ibb.co/r255MqB) also restricted trades of squeezed stocks, while multiple trading platforms suffered [outages](https://ibb.co/QPj0Vp2) amid the high volatility in the market.

Companies that are benefiting from this should at least take advantage just like and do equity offerings to raise capital that might help them in their struggling businesses.

I don’t know how much longer the short squeeze can go right now, as most of the fund & money managers have closed their position in these highly shorted stocks, while WSB also got banned from [Discord](https://ibb.co/KzPGCwh), though they cited other reasons for banning the subreddit, not the ongoing short squeeze, while the [SEC](https://ibb.co/R4myTTZ) and other big players are closely watching the situation.

We also had [Apple](https://ibb.co/XbGJyLm) delivering great beats on both the revenues and earnings/share as they hit $111B in revenues for the quarter, which is the first time they’ve had a quarter over $100B. The iPhone revenues overdelivered with the new iPhone 12 Lineup crushing expectations, as I expected, with over $65B in revenues as the iPhone’s delayed release, strong incentives to upgrade and the broader stay-at-home market helped the sales rise more than expected, with all but one of the other categories also beating expectations while Mac revenues came in just shy of the expected figure.

China sales also recovered from a 29% y/y decline last quarter to a strong 57% gains this quarter, as this helped Apple generate record operating cash flow of almost $39B while returning over $30B to shareholders as they are targeting a net cash neutral position over time, thus continuing to reward shareholders.

This didn’t help the [stock](https://ibb.co/2K6vd1D) though as it struggled in after hours and was down more than 3%, as the sell-off continued like in most of the stocks.

The other big tech name that reported was [Facebook](https://ibb.co/S5CRXDL) as they also beat expectations on eps, revenues, daily & monthly active users.

The initial reaction in after-hours was also bad for Facebook as they continue to expect ad-targeting headwinds due to the Apple platform changes and evolving regulatory landscape. They did however announce a $25B buyback program on top of the $8.6B remaining in the current one, though this didn’t help as investors were disappointed in the drop in [usage](https://ibb.co/HxYpjqf) in North America, as most of the growth came from the Asia-Pacific region, which is not as profitable as North America yet.

And meanwhile, [Tesla](https://ibb.co/X2FzfrK) also reported in after-hours, as they missed on EPS by $0.25 on a smaller than expected automotive margin of 24.1%, though revenues increased by more than 45% year/year.

This was the 6th straight quarter of profit for the company, and Tesla expects the volume of car sales to have a sustained 50% average annual growth over multiple years though they didn’t offer a clear target for 2021 while they also expect the Tesla Semi deliveries to start later in the year.

The one big [change](https://ibb.co/X48YGfJ) we saw, was Musk saying the company is open to licensing its software and allowing other companies to use the Supercharger network while the Full-Self-Driving subscriptions will be available “very soon” the company reported. I like Tesla very much, but at these levels, it’s very hard to over-deliver time & time again. The likelihood of Tesla rising 30 to 50% in the near future is smaller than the one that Tesla sees somewhat of a correction after the huge run to end 2020 and start 2021, so, I wouldn’t add to my positions right now. Right now, and probably for the next couple of months Tesla is a hold for me and nothing more.

So, let’s hope for a better day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/Mhs9VVV) are still pointing to a red open, while we await to see the [latest](https://ibb.co/rpfdSP8) jobless claims numbers and to see the GDP from Q4, which is expected to come in at a 4.3% annualized growth. Maybe if we get some positive read on the economic numbers, we might see a shift in the markets.

2020-12-21 09:38:57,SEPT. 2021 AAPL EV LAUNCH,"Apple's long-rumored electric vehicle is running at least two years ahead of schedule and will be released in the third quarter of 2021, according to Taiwan's Economic Daily News, which cites unnamed executives at Taiwanese manufacturers.

Apple car wheel icon feature yellow

The report claims that Taiwanese manufacturers are preparing to ramp up for production of ""Apple Car"" components as early as the second quarter of next year, adding that Apple has been secretly testing dozens of prototype vehicles on the road in California. Apple received a permit from California's DMV to test self-driving vehicles in 2017, and it was spotted using Lexus SUVs rigged with LiDAR equipment that year.

While many sources have claimed the Apple Car will be released between 2023 and 2025, including analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the report cites an unnamed director at a major Taiwanese manufacturer who said Apple is targeting a September 2021 launch.

2021-01-13 04:54:09,Stock Market News for Today | PLUG Power & GM | TSLA vs AAPL| AFRM & other Stock Market News [01-13],"**Big tech struggles as small-caps continue to overperform. Plug Power rises on Renault venture while GM reveals flying car. Is Tesla going to crush Apple? Let’s talk about this & other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market posting small gains, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/V2Yn5xJ) leading the way, up .28%, the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/hMpFmmF) gaining 60 points and the [SP500](https://ibb.co/YLYfs4V) finishing flat for the day, just about 3800, while the [VIX](https://ibb.co/sgR88nB) posted a 3% decline, though it seemed it was going to go back into higher volatility territory in the middle of the day

We also saw almost 70% of [companies](https://ibb.co/vHBQThL) advancing with 260 new highs on about average volume as 6 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/7pwD88M) finished in the green, with Energy leading the way yet again & continuing to outperform in 2021, while Health Care and Communications lost more than 1%, with Large-Cap Growth Companies being the biggest laggard, also continuing the huge underperformance compared to all other factors, as small & mid-caps have largely [outperformed](https://ibb.co/QH694Vc) since the start of the year.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/2Kt4ChR) from yesterday, with most big tech companies losing ground, though Tesla did recover after an 8% plunge on Monday and was also joined by the Banks, the Semiconductors and the Oil & Gas companies.

Yesterday we also got some economic data, with the Small Business Optimism [INDEX](https://ibb.co/12TgvbS) falling sharply to 95.9 in December, vs the 102 expected and 101.4 in the previous month, as the small business optimism has continued to drop after the highs it made in September, while job [OPENINGS](https://ibb.co/S0VG5PZ) came pretty much in line with the previous report at 6.52M, as the openings rate remained double the quits rate. And in some better news we saw the worldwide semiconductor [MARKET](https://ibb.co/8NZ79p7) gaining 7% year over year to reach $39.4B for November, as the world will keep on needing more & more semiconductors with improving technology, I really like this sector and I believe it’s one of the best for long-term investing.

[Today](https://ibb.co/s3c5sMQ) we start the day off with the MBA Mortgage Applications, Consumer Price Index and finish the day with the Treasury Budget and the FED’s Beige Book.

While in the IPO world, we will see [AFFIRM](https://ibb.co/6WqTmZX) start trading today, as the company set the final IPO price at $49 way above the first and second ranges between 33-44$. I really am interested in this company thought it’s unlikely we will see shares available to retail traders under 60-70$ in my opinion, while in the M&A department, we saw [VISA](https://ibb.co/CVkG87d) terminate the merger agreement with Plaid a year after the first announcement of the proposed transaction.

In some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/VBYhdY1), we saw Boeing land a $1.7B Air Force contract. This is good news for Boeing, as the commercial airlines business will be struggling at least for a couple of years until they ramp up the MAX production & airline traffic demand goes back close to the levels seen before 2020, which might happen with more easily scalable vaccines coming soon from the likes of [JNJ](https://ibb.co/VCpS3Kw), while they also did suffer another hit with a plane crash in Asia, though it’s not expected to be from a manufacturing defect, but [RATHER](https://ibb.co/Y2TZtNK) by the lax maintenance in the 9months the airplane was grounded last year.

We also saw Plug Power [skyrocket](https://ibb.co/3yChM7R) yet again, finishing the day up over 20% after the announcement of a hydrogen venture with Renault. This joint venture is [expected](https://ibb.co/LhFHnrX) to lead to further developments in fuel cell & hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, that will be based on Renaults platforms, as the companies will combine the manufacturing capabilities of the OEM with the fuel cell & hydrogen system knowledge from Plug Power. It’s expected they will also provide refueling stations to help the ecosystem, in an effort to offer vertical integration with vehicles, fueling stations, services & selling hydrogen fuel to customers. It’s seems a good & interesting development, but I would avoid buying it after such a huge [SPIKE](https://ibb.co/WkGwC79), it should have somewhat of a small pullback sometime soon.

In the Automobile world we also saw GM making a big splash at CES, with announcements of a big [PUSH](https://ibb.co/swv4wn3) into electric vans, a new Venture called BrightDrop that will develop even more electric-powered machinery and the surprise reveal of a [FLYING](https://ibb.co/G5bP3YX) Cadillac, while [TESLA](https://ibb.co/W2H1xrc) just registered its Indian entity just as ARK’s Invest CEO [NOTED](https://ibb.co/qWjZqmF) that Tesla is still way ahead of Apple by taking a page from their own playbook when developing their own chips for the autonomous vehicles. I personally believe that there is enough room for both companies to exist in this new EV path by mostly crushing other traditional OEMs which aren’t good enough at adopting this new trend like Nissan & others.

We also saw Walmart adding even more news on the back of the [FINTECH](https://ibb.co/DVKSgGb) startup, as they are also planning on experimenting with even [MORE](https://ibb.co/g7qgstZ) delivery options, as the company seems to be trying to innovate as much as possible to increase the efficiency, as they try to compete as much as possible with online-purpose [RETAILERS](https://ibb.co/YjMjDLw) that are high flying yet again.

And one last piece of [NEWS](https://ibb.co/zQBd1L5), is that we saw a report that suggests the iPhone 12 sold 18M units in China in the last quarter of 2020, exceeding all expectations and more than doubling their market share from 10% to over 20%, thus delivering a hit to Asian manufacturers of smartphones. This is exactly what I expected as the new iPhone 12 lineup should be a hit around the world, with many loyal Apple brand followers switching to the 5G technology and to the better camera capabilities. This will also help Apple increase the services business revenue streams, as an increased devices base will lead to increased services usage.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as both the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/HB5P34r) Markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/BgwpqT8) are mixed, with the Nasdaq posting to a small open gain.

2021-01-28 09:08:17,retard in training here. (AAPL),Can someone pleaser explain why tf AAPL is down after record breaking earnings? i know all eyes are on GME/fucking over hedge funds which i am down for 10000000% Citron fucked me over on $60k profit on $CVSI a couple years ago so fuck them but at the same time wtf is going on with AAPL here..,5,0.73

2020-12-22 21:21:24,"$MGA: AAPLs, EVs and low Implied Volatility","All I have heard about the last couple of days is AAPL getting into EVs, how it affects Tesla etc. I can’t believe no one has brought up Magna International ($MGA) yet. They are a legit Tier-1 EV supplier with $40B in revenue (yet only a $19.9b market cap) that is a top contender to partner with AAPL. News just broke tonight as I was typing this up of Magna creating a $1B joint venture with LG electronics to make EV gear ([https://www.reuters.com/article/lg-elec-magna-intl-jv-idUSKBN28X0BC](https://www.reuters.com/article/lg-elec-magna-intl-jv-idUSKBN28X0BC)). Oh and options are dirt cheap, with implied volatility currently around 35 and a low company valuation (only  \~1/2x revenue and under 10x forward P/E). This is still early innings for this play. Some key points about Magna:

•	Has already had prior discussions with AAPL regarding outsourcing their vehicles ([https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/us-business/magna-in-good-position-to-build-apple-google-cars-says-ceo/article24320885/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/us-business/magna-in-good-position-to-build-apple-google-cars-says-ceo/article24320885/))

•	Prototype that MGA supplied to AAPL in 2012 looks very similar to AAPLs current prototype ([https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/))

•	Boomers are catching wind of it, picture below is from today

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u2ynvybagv661.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=215b417ee3fc4d879f30a523bf7db0941b982e24

•	Fisker (FSR) recently announced they will use Magna’s EV platform for their upcoming Ocean SUV. Magna has warrants for 6% equity stake in FSR. Fisker’s market cap is currently \~$4.4b, implying Magna’s stake is worth north of $250m.

•	Invested in Waymo (Google’s self-driving car program) alongside other top-tier investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Silver Lake and partnered with Waymo on their first factory

•	Very active in core autonomous technologies and is first to market with solid-state LiDAR ([https://www.magna.com/blog/post/on-the-road-to-a-complete-adas-systems-provider](https://www.magna.com/blog/post/on-the-road-to-a-complete-adas-systems-provider))

•	Makes the Jaguar i-Pace since 2018 (Waymo placed order for 20,000 vehicles plus 20,000 other vehicles sold)

**Financials/Stock:**

•	Currently at 52-week high

•	Market cap just under $20B with $38B revenue

•	Operating cash flow more than doubled in last quarter to $1.6B

•	Trades for under 10x forward P/E

**How this trade goes right:**

•	Perception of potential AAPL partnership drives share price up, already has good momentum

•	Actual AAPL partnership sends this to the moon

•	Fisker goes on a run and MGA benefits from equity stake

•	Low implied volatility gives this trade very good risk:reward

•	Valuation multiple “catches up” to comparable EV suppliers

**Risks and mitigants:**

•	Current market conditions erode, causing a broad market selloff. This risk is low over the next year given the Fed is committed to keeping interest rates low at least until 2023-2024 and pumping billions of dollars’ worth of liquidity into the market each day (incl. purchases of corporate bonds and junk debt).

•	AAPL partnership doesn’t materialize. Apple’s exclusive leak to Reuters highlights the tech giant’s intent to produce cars. While I think Magna is in the pole position to win business from AAPL, Magna already has a robust business that will grow well next year without any AAPL revenue. Magna’s relatively cheap valuation vs. peers gives the stock plenty of runway without AAPL hype.

2020-10-15 11:17:55,I Jelq AAPL for a living,"My intuition told me about this subreddit the other day and I couldn't believe it. I took a look last night, you guys are fucking crazy but I love it. It's easy for any professional jelqer to say that you guys are idiots but I respect what you do, so no hate on my end (see how I called myself a professional and you guys idiots while pretending to compliment you? I’m a master at the backhanded jelq). Jelqing is calculated gambling at the end of the day anyway. Compared to you guys, I'm basically a stock trader but damn good at it (I like to compliment myself because no one else does, they tell me my penis is average). AAPL is my jelq king.

I'm a swinger on the 15min chart and 5min, just depends on the action. I obviously don't extend every trade but I shoot large profits squeezed over 1-3 inches so losses don't matter. Willing to help any newbs sometimes and show you what my targets are on certain days when I see good stretches.

Current:

Last 2 stretches got taken out at breakeven (told you I’m damn good). Waiting for trades to setup. So far I don't see anything that I like (I’m the best, always find good trades and when I don’t, losses don’t matter. I’ve lost so much money at this point, but when you don’t care, they don’t matter). With what happened today, I'm looking to see if the length dips below 119.02 or 118.14 millimeters sometime in the next couple of days and looking to elongate if the right setup happens. Looking for a bounce off the 200 millimeter.",902,0.94
2020-08-30 17:23:47,This is what will ACTUALLY happen to TSLA and AAPL on Monday open,"**Bull reasons:**

* They just got a whole lot cheaper and the average pleb will be all over that shit.
* People FOMO hard from the fuss.
* People have bugs in their algos and they haven't adjusted them for split. When the algos see a super low price they insta buy the fuck out of it.
* Big dogs double down because they have priced in stuff you can't begin to imagine. Oh, and everything is priced in.
* No one dares to short Musk and Cook, because they will get cucked. Again.
* FDs just got cheaper and every retard can afford them. Time to gamble with lunch money.
* Battery day and S&P inclusion for TSLA and ARM based computers from AAPL coming soon.
* If people wanted to lock in gains, they would have done so on Friday.
* StOnKs OnLy gO uP.

&#x200B;

**Bear reasons:**

* The average pleb thinks they've gotten enough tendies from Papa Musk and Tim Apple. They sell it all to lock in gains. Also, that's the 3rd eviction notice and they finally have to pay rent. They cash out.
* Fractional shares already exist for those who wanted cheap AAPL and TSLA. There is no need for the college kids to buy due to lower price.
* Broke af people with just 1 share see an opportunity for liquidity. Before the split, on the one hand, they wanted to lock in gains and on the other hand they didn't want to sell their only share of their biggest winner. Now they can sell part of their position.
* People are expecting them to drop, because they are overextended and we are in a dot com bubble. They sell in order to ""buy the dip"".
* Retard algos auto trigger from unusual activity and sell hard.
* Big dogs are expecting the dip and sell at open driving everything down even further.
* Stocks that split historically underperform initially.
* All the paper hands see a small initial dip for any of the above reasons and they sell off.

2020-12-22 12:36:53,AAPL EV is good for Tesla,"**Unless any of you guys think that another electric vehicle company is going to be able to produce higher quality cars at a lower cost than Tesla which I think is exceedingly unlikely, then all news of competitor electric vehicles should be treated as a positive. Here’s why: **

For Tesla, **Dominating the electric vehicle market right now is far less important than hastening the transition to an electric automotive market.** Every electric vehicle that comes out , Especially if an Apple vehicle comes out, normalizes the concept and reality of electric vehicles for the American consumer. It makes them more comfortable with it. Big brand names with consumer trust like the legacy auto manufacturers and Apple instill confidence in electric vehicle purchases for the average American.  

**Therefore, if tesla can retain the edge and remain the best electric vehicle manufactured at the lowest price, they stand up from facilitated American adoption of electrical transport.**

Currently, tesla enjoys that very same status. Tesla reigns supreme within the electric vehicle sector right now. I think that is likely to stay… 

- The manufacturing advances they are making with the model Y (casting machine) and the cybertruck, (folding chassis) and The new battery design, which is designed in order to enable very cheap, mass manufacturing, are unlikely to be challenged by any electric vehicle competitor from a cost basis. Tesla is going to source its own raw materials for batteries for the most part, whereas their competitors are going to have to buy from third-party. 

- unlike other car companies, Tesla doesn’t have entrenched unions, it doesn’t have colossal amounts of debt, it doesn’t have an entrenched dealership network opposed to electric vehicle adoption.

- unlike Apple and other electric vehicle start ups, tesla already has brand name recognition, a Pan-American repair and delivery network

- Tesla technology lead to pack right now. People have been saying for years that a Tesla killer was on the horizon. Currently not exists. Tesla had the first mover advantage of moving from a luxury, to semi luxury, to main stream car in order to facilitate their growth. Other companies don’t have this luxury, they have to produce a car competitive with the model Y and the model3 immediately, but without the strong internal engineering capacity while having to source parts including batteries and components from third parties. 

**I genuinely don’t see a path to success for competitors outside of smaller niche market like small transport, vans, traditional truck designs, that sort of thing. I think Tesla has such a lead at the moment, that they are in the process of juicing the most out of capital expenses, their technology is so far ahead in terms of efficiency and cost, that they absolutely stand to benefit from competitor vehicles.**

In fact, I think the worst case scenario is that the entire auto sector ignores Tesla and continues business as usual, not normalizing electric vehicle ownership and letting Tesla be lord of a little kingdom rather than a prominent player in the entire auto sector.

One thing you guys need to keep in mind is that the current share price is, obviously, directly tied to future sales estimates. I genuinely think these are conservative. If the transition to an electric car market is hastened for the majority of Americans, and test the remains number one, the current number projections are exceedingly low. Especially when you factor in the profit margin on Tesla insurance, full self driving subscription, among others.",19,0.75

[IOS 14 Features (Wired) (17.12)](https://www.wired.com/story/ios-14-privacy-security-features/)

It seems like Apple is building a solid foundation for privacy.  After all these features aren't anything mind blowing, but if Apple continues this path, they could set the new standard for phones and privacy. Apple is powerful as fuck, and as we have seen, they are not afraid of big corporations like Epic Games, Google, Facebook, Spotify, Microsoft (who all piled on Apple on the Epic Games vs Apple case).

2020-11-15 15:05:37,Long $AAPL - New Apple M1 chip benchmark leaked,"Apple last week released the following new Macs.

\- MacBook Air

\- MacBook Pro 13 inch

\- Mac mini

These 3 Macs all share same chip, [Apple M1](https://www.apple.com/mac/m1/). So Apple is no longer putting Intel CPU in their new Mac product lines.

&#x200B;

So you might wonder, how good is this chip?

&#x200B;

Based on the leak (and official ones will be released in 2 days when people start receiving their macs), it appears that the new MacBook **Air** destroys the last year's top of the line MacBook **Pro** 16 inch's performance in benchmark, according to what is listed on Geekbench. It also means that Mac mini, which costs ($699) stumps all previous MBP's performances.

&#x200B;

||[2020 MacBook Air ($999)](https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-air-late-2020) , 2020 Mac mini ($699), 2020 MacBook Pro 13inch ($1299)|[2019 Macbook Pro 16inch & CPU upgraded ($2999)](https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-pro-16-inch-late-2019)|[2019 MacBook Air ($999)](https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-air-early-2020-intel-core-i7-1060ng7-1-2-ghz-4-cores)|[i7-9700k](https://browser.geekbench.com/processors/intel-core-i7-9700k)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Single-core Score (Geekbench5)|**1717**|1095|1138|1289|
|Multi-core Score (Geekbench5)|**7380**|6869|3072|7267|

&#x200B;

I see that this leap in performance is far greater than what AMD did when they first announced their Ryzen1,2,3 product lines in past few years, and I dare to say that we might be observing start of new era where Apple silicon for laptop computer will be dominating over Intel/AMD going forward for next few years, similar to how their *A* series silicon in iPhone started dominating over all other mobile chips in smartphones, and the gap has not been closing.

The new M1 chip's single core score of 1717 [outshines](https://browser.geekbench.com/processor-benchmarks) all of consumer level CPUs, and its multicore performance is similar to that of i7-9700k. You need to understand that TDP difference between these M1 and i7-9700k chips are huge. M1 runs with 10watt\~20watt TDP while i7-9700k has 95watt TDP .

In short, laptop processor M1 is doing much work with much less energy (less heat) than i7-9700k, which is a desktop processor, and that is how Apple was able to release new MacBook Air this year without any cooling fans. You can't imagine running Intel i7 cpu without cooling fan. This just shows tech level differences and how much Apple was able to achieve by spending on research with billions in their cash reserve.

The M1 chip, without need of any separate graphic card offers GPU performance similar to RX 570 or GTX 1060. The intel's counterpart onboard graphic chip, Intel UHD630, has much worse GPU performance than M1, and they are incomparable.

Apple will be working on improved version of M1 chip, (possibly known as M1X), so that they can put them into MacBook Pro 16inch product lines, and higher end version of Mac mini, and I foresee that to be much faster than any other laptop CPUs out in the wild today, and on par with high end desktop processors.

Of course, the shift in momentum in userbase or AAPL's stock price won't happen in a single day or in single month, just like how release of the first iPhone or Apple's first SoC A4 (which were great innovations at the time but were incomprehensible for many fund managers, as well as to Warren Buffet) at that time of release didn't pop AAPL's stock price 10x times in one day or one month.

However, I think AAPL will be gradually increase market share in laptop computer markets over time, and also be able to make more profits due to simpler logistic (They now only need to produce/maintain one M1 line compared to having to embed 11 different intel chips, and having to work with Intel), and possibly expand their influence over to the desktop computer as well in the future.

TL DR:

\- Apple M1 chip dominates.

\- Buy $AAPL LEAP call options 2022-09-16 at $120 strike price, and don't look back.",29,0.79
2020-09-28 20:13:37,Doubling up - AAPL,"upvote if you are gay. downvote if you are gay.

It's a simple play that might be a bit boomerish or it might just be something solid to put in your portfolio for a few weeks to help pay for your new dads new wife's new boyfriends's dick reduction surgery.

AAPL earnings 10/29. Expectations are high so this just bets on AAPL staying essentially where it is now and the return is 100%. Seems very reasonable.

Buy the AAPL 11/6 $105 call for $13

Sell the AAPL 11/6 $115 call for $7

so that's $5 for a spread that'll be worth $10 if the stock maintains $115. If it loses money in the next week or two and you wanna exit for a loss, you can. If the stock rockets and you make 50% profit in the next week, you can take the money and run. If earning disappoint, you've at least got a week to exit somewhat gracefully. A moderate loss instead of a total loss.

I have 10, so that's $5k which with some luck will become $10k. I know that's not 'how would i turn $8 into $40million?' but trussssss me daddy, doubling up will make you rich. Just think:

2020-08-29 02:25:43,Why Apple has much more room to grow within the next year. $AAPL,"I’ve been making YouTube tech reviews and videos on Apple products for the past 4 years. Currently making videos for the Max Tech YouTube channel. 

This is going to be the most important positive change for Apple ever since I started. You literally have no idea. 

— The iPhone 12 is getting released with the A14 chip that will be so much more powerful than the Qualcomm chip in android phones that they won’t be able to catch up for years. (The new 865 plus is hardly faster than last year’s overpriced 865) 

— this will be achieved by using TSMC’s brand new 5nm technology which is gonna be more powerful and more power efficient than people are expecting. 

— TSMC is already working on their 3nm tech that will be going into 2022 iPhones, iPads and Macs. 

— they are gonna implement 5G across their iPhone lineup without raising the prices crazy high like other brands like Samsung are forced to do right now. 

— leaks have shown that the iPhone 12 pro will come with the widely requested 120Hz display and insane camera recording features (4K at 240fps) 

— their Apple silicon chip Macs are gonna be so good and so powerful using TSMC’s 5nm tech that people’s minds will be blown. The new features and battery life are gonna be game changers. 

— the transition period to ARM-based chips will be much smoother than people are expecting. 

— these Macs will likely also have models with support for 5G cellular. 

— their new iPads are gonna start getting redesigned with a modern design for the first time in years. While the android tablets aren’t getting much better. Huge demand upswing. 

— the Apple Watch is gonna support more sensors and features than ever before, and they’re gonna release a brand new budget model for the first time. 

— Apple is gonna release their brand new services bundles which are gonna be very popular, and we all know that services are where the money is at. 

— Apple is gonna release a new Apple TV which will begin to get marketed as a gaming console. They’ll release a new gaming controller at the same time that will work across all of their Apple devices including the iPhone. 

— Apple will release a HomePod mini to better compete with the Amazon echo and push their Apple Music sales. 

— Apple is gonna begin to switch most of their devices to Mini-LED displays on their devices which will be almost as good as OLED without all of the drawbacks. 

— The stock split is gonna allow a bunch of new investors to get in after they realize all of this is happening. 

Those are just a few of the reasons why Apple has even more room to grow within the next year. -Vadim from the Max Tech channel on YouTube.

## How AAPL's 4-for-1 stock split can affect your account

Apple Inc. (AAPL) recently announced a 4-for-1 stock split. The split takes effect on August 31 for shareholders of record on Aug. 24. The stock split happens automatically in your account and you are not required to do anything. TD Ameritrade does not charge a fee for this type of a stock split.

If you own shares of AAPL before market open on Aug. 31 you will own four shares for every one you hold, and the stock price will be reduced to one-fourth of its value at the start of trading on Aug. 31. For example, if you hold 100 shares of AAPL trading at $400 per share, after the split you will own 400 shares valued at $100 per share. Likewise, if you own one options call with a strike price of $400, after the split you would own four contracts controlling 100 shares each, at a $100 strike price.

If you sell AAPL shares after Aug. 24 but before Aug. 31, you will sell them at the pre-split price. You will not be entitled to the split shares. For example: If on the last business day of trading AAPL, Aug. 28, you sell 300 shares for a pre-split market price of $400 per share, you will receive $120,000. You will not receive any split shares.

If you buy shares after Aug. 24 but before Aug. 31, you will purchase shares at the pre-split price. Following the split, you will receive the additional shares resulting from the stock split. For example: If on Aug. 26 you buy 100 shares (and hold them through the open on Aug. 31) at $400 per share, you will pay $40,000. You will receive 300 additional shares after the stock split, and the price will be reduced to the post-split price.

## How TSLA’s 5-for-1 stock split can affect your account

Tesla Inc. (TSLA) recently announced a 5-for-1 stock split. The split takes effect on August 31 for each shareholder of record on Aug. 21. The stock split happens automatically in your account and you are not required to do anything. TD Ameritrade does not charge a fee for this type of a stock split.

If you own shares of TSLA before the market open on Aug. 31 you will own five shares for every one you hold, and the stock price will be reduced to one-fifth of its value at the start of trading on Aug. 31. For example, if you hold 100 shares of TSLA trading at $1,500 per share, after the split you will own 500 shares valued at $300 per share. Likewise, if you own 1 options call controlling 100 shares with a strike price of $1,500, after the split you would own 5 contracts and control 500 shares at a $300 strike price.

If you sell TSLA shares after the record date of Aug. 21 for TSLA but before Aug. 31, you will sell them at the pre-split price. You will not be entitled to the split shares. For example: If on the last business day of trading TSLA, Aug. 28 you sell 100 TSLA shares for a pre-split market price of $1,500 per share you will receive $150,000. You will not receive any split shares.

If you buy TSLA shares after the record dates but before Aug. 31, you will purchase shares at the pre-split price. Following the split, you will receive the additional shares resulting from the stock split. For example: If on Aug. 26 you buy 100 shares (and hold them through the open on Aug. 31) at $1,500 per share, you will pay $150,000. You will receive 400 additional shares after the stock split, and the price will be reduced to the post-split price.",191,0.94

2020-10-29 15:19:36,How $AAPL can get to $117 by 11/13,"Were you raped by $AAPL despite them having their best September ever? You may be entitled to compensation.

Real men and 1%ers carry their options through earnings and if you're like me, you're probably pulling out the old boy scout handbook on how to tie certain knots. Here's how we can save ourselves.

At precisely 4AM ET, we need about 1% of this sub, or 16,000 users to max out their margin (see *free money*) to go all in on $AAPL shares. Yes, shares. 

16,000 users maxing out $10,000 gives us $160,000,000 of **free** capital.

At 109.59 a share, we can scoop up 1,500,000 shares right at pre-market open.

This unprecedented volume will make other investors think that Grand Daddy Carl Icahn was very impressed with earnings and is going all in on a lame share YOLO effectively increasing the stock price to $150 and making all of us with OTM options rich enough to get access to the 2020 November Bull Massacre.

Now when thinking about how to play it, I decided to brainstorm a list of really good ideas and strategies to make the most of this royal blue chip stock. I decided the best strategy was to tear the list up, roast it over some charcoal, and eat it. Now here’s where it gets good: Apple is a fruit. Fruit attracts fruit flies. Planes also fly. 9/11 is an important and solemn day in NYC. NYC is also known as the Big Apple. Big starts with “B”. Buy also starts with “B”. Therefore: Buy Apple. Now as for the strike price, that was a little trickier. I decided to hold my breath for as long as I could, and got to 54 seconds. Multiply 54 by 10 and you get 540.

There is a lot of people spreading misinformation by saying that it’s a “deadline” and that you won’t be eligible for the stock split after the record date. THAT IS COMPLETELY FALSE! 

You can still buy the stock next week and still be eligible for the 5:1 stock split. The record date just records who is eligible for the stock as of August 21st. However, When you buy the stock next week you buy the stock and the right to the 5:1 stock split from the person who was recorded on August 21st. That’s it, you still get your 5 shares after the split. The only date that really matters is August 31st, which is the split date.

Feel free to copy and paste my post if you come across anyone wondering about the record date!

The event held every fall, almost always results in the addition of a new iPhone series and/or Apple product. This year’s event should be no different as analysts and tech journalists offer their speculation on what we should expect from the tech giant. Most expect to see the reveal of the new iPhone 12, which many believe will be Apple’s first 5G product. Others are hoping for Apple to reveal a new generation of AirPods, under the name AirPod studio offering studio quality sound. Fortunately for us the guessing game has come to an end. Tim Apple himself, Apple’s big boss man and playboy has come forward with some exciting news about tomorrow’s event. Tomorrow on 9/15/20 Apple will release its newest phone, the iPhone 12, but perhaps even more exciting, they will be releasing their newest accessory  “Apple Scuba”. Apple Scuba is a new function on the next generation iPhone series that allows users to breathe underwater via a breathing apparatus that can be plugged into the phone’s charging port. Users simply plug in the new accessory, open the Apple Scuba app, put their mouth on the mouth piece and click the lock button for fresh Apple oxygen. Tim Apple believes this will allow users to seamless travel underwater like never before possible and states “I wanted users to experience underwater travel like never before possible”. This is definitely going to set Apple apart from its competitors and help people that want to breathe underwater breathe underwater.",72,0.78

2020-08-24 03:45:39,AAPL long term,"Gooooood morning crayon-munching community.        
With the AAPL run up last week, the meme power, the white bitches breaking and buying more iPhones power, I had an interesting thought.
        
So Timmy and the boys at A.P.P.L.E. (All People Purchase Largeamountsofour Electronics) continue to surge past rough meetings (the tech CEO hearing) and lawsuits (Epic Games, although I guess that’s not over yet so who knows what’s coming this week).  
       
My point is: Apple isn’t dying anytime soon.  There are many things I hate about apple products and their business model; but guess what I’m typing this post on.  An __iphone 7.__  It’s the simple fact that Apple had the first intriguing and attractive display on a functioning smart phone, and I guarantee you 90% of people with iPhones would switch to a non-Apple phone if the account switching and device learning weren’t such a hassle.  On top of that, iOS is generally more attractive to the eye.   And on top of *that,* all the braindeads with Apple devices wouldn’t switch to such a shit on community of devices.  How many times have you seen that dumbass tweet “if the text don’t come in blue, I ain’t wanna talk to you🤧” or something along the lines of shaming androids and calling them broke boys?  
It’s just a fact that Apple will not die, and they will continue to grow long term with the assortment of powers Apple has.
        
So here was my thought;
Apple is guaranteed to continue growing in the next couple years; aside from apple making a disgustingly bad move and ruining the Apple Inc. name, the risk in writing off puts between $400-$500 and opening spreads a bit higher is almost zero.  
       
Open a 540/580 credit put spread for 9/16/2022, receive $2710 in premium INSTANTLY, and watch as both contracts get passed up by apples sprinting share price in Naruto-like fashion, and become crumbled remains within the next year (when apple shoots up to 600+ in 12 months time).
      
Giving Apple a 20% growth from now could be too generous, it could be lowballing the fuck out of it.  
Regardless, Apple won’t be trading below 550 next year.
       
I’m not saying go all in and go full stupid mode (this is WSB I know where I am and what I’m doing i ***SWEAR***) but I can’t see how writing a couple 400 puts, a 450 or two, and maybe a 500 and then opening some CPspreads could fuck me.  If Tim loses his touch and Apple crashes into the mud, then obviously I’d be in for quite a mess...
But set instant alerts for apples stock price and news and watch out for nukes to the stock price 
     
I’d **love** to hear what you lot have to say.

These are just few examples of the comments made during the APPL presentation. Well there's one thing I'd like to share with you guys. Believe it or not you can get some really really good info here. It's called.....  [https://Google.com](https://Google.com)  Yes. Shocking! A source where literally anything you want to know can be found. Believe it or not, it has been known for over a week that APPL would not be unveiling the new Iphone today. It took me 15 seconds to discover this highly classified info. 

AAPL sold off during most of the presentation and took a dump at the very end. But guess what. The dip was bought and it's still green on the day. Do people think APPL will just skip the Iphone this year? Obviously they're saving the best for last. The Iphone reveal should be in mid October. You know what that means? Another month of speculation and buy the rumor. The fact AAPL is still up on the day (at the time of writing this) is bullish. BTFD! 

If you panic sold your calls you made a mistake. AAPL is still trading at 16% below its ATH and will only go up from here. If you bought weeklies and are disappointed after today's event, Idk what to tell you, except do a 15 second DD next time and buy some NOV-JAN calls. Overall the presentation was not bad. People were just disappointed that there was no Iphone and possibly IGlasses. 

TLDR: Stonks only go up (especially AAPL). Buy some AAPL calls not too far OTM exp in Novemver-January. Want to play it very safe? Look at the prices on 2021 leaps. Look at the 09/17/2021 $150C. Low premium, good greeks, and nice volume.

**tl;dr AAPL 11/20 120c. Share your positions!**

I'm a noob when it comes to trading and options. Discovered this a few months ago, and have enjoyed plenty of gains because of all you retards. 

I wanted to talk about AAPL and see what the group feels about it. Since AAPL's been having these red days, I got in on the 120c's for November.  I know we have a few upcoming catalysts - 

1. iPad and Apple Watch event, which is coming soon apparently.
2. iPhone 12 launch event, which is apparently its first 5g phone, so that should be exciting.

TSLA was another stock that underwent the split, but I think AAPL has better fundamentals, and looking at their business model, I think they should still go up in the near future.

Sorry I don't have any DD or anything, but I wanted to check on how others are planning on playing AAPL in the next months. I couldn't find a post where people were just talking about AAPL, so I thought I'd just make one.

What do you people think ? What are your AAPL positions ? What would you recommend ?

2020-08-04 01:27:00,AAPL will become the first $5 trillion company,"Reasons:

1. Apple Silicon and its semiconductor ventures
2. Apple Glass
3. Apple's investments in autonomous vehicle technology and its other operations in the autos sector
4. Insane buybacks and its commitments for being cash neutral within a few years(For reference, AAPL spends almost as much money on buybacks as the Government of Bangladesh spends on its budget to manage a country with a population of 165 million people)
5. Apple Pay and other transaction facilitation platforms
6. Their growing device portfolios
7. Their growing services portfolios
8. Anti-trust wins
9. Others. :)
10. But probably the biggest of all, the case for Apple bulls has been growing stronger and stronger as it reaches higher valuations, which is not quite applicable for AMZN or MSFT. Sure, market sentiment is fickle, but AAPL seems to have remained consistently out of bearish sentiment for quite a while, whereas AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, FB all faced it. Though it may be partly explained by its buyback program and Berkshire's involvement.
11. Fed (it applies to all others too).
12. Inclusion in almost every type of portfolio and indexes. Dividend investors, growth investors, day traders(obviously), speculators etc.

2020-10-13 22:46:54,Why should I buy Tim's AAPL dip and how should I play it?,"I'll try to keep this short and to the point. I'll save the time and complaints for some of you but the end result is leaps. If this is to gay for you then you're more than welcome to skip this post.

A lot of you are disappointed in this new iPhone  presentation. As history shows AAPL's stock price usually drops the day of their new iPhone reveal. I really don't know what people were expecting but this iPhone launch is very bullish. It's the best one made in a while. The prices are great and the new subscription packages will help revenue. Everyone expected 5G and the leaks took away from any real surprises

**So why should I buy the dip?**

Let's take a quick look at the price action for the last 11 AAPL events 60 days after the iPhone reveal. In only 2 of those years AAPL's stock price saw a decline in those 60 days. The first instance was in 2012. The iPhone 5 did not meet investors expectations and this is seen to many as the worst iPhone release. The second instance was in 2016 for the iPhone SE release. So this iPhone was the first of two phones released during the year. This was seen as the most affordable version released before the iPhone 7 six months later. Many investors were waiting on the newer and better model. On top of this AAPL also underwent an inventory correction related to the mismatch of the iPhone 6s and SE.

Besides those 2 events, AAPL's stock has mooned the 9 other times. For those 9 events AAPL sees an average of a 9% increase in stock price 60 days after the event. The two best years being in 2009 with a 16% increase and last year with a 17% increase. Now for those who are getting ready to comment ""bUt wAs a PaNdEmIc aNd EleCtIoNs PrIceD In"" please stfu. We know the pandemic won't affect it's stock price and the elections can swing in either direction. 11 AAPL events is a substantial sample size and with AAPL's new releases it is hard to see how it's price won't go up much higher.

**Other reasons to be bullish:**

Potential stimulus, New AAPL subscriptions, Wider range of iPhone models, Christmas around the corner, Tech is king, Becky, for you TA nerds current cup and handle, and of course Stonks only go up.

**How Should I play this?**

Don't buy anything shorter than 60 days exp. Jan calls are best to avoid theta burn and to let Christmas FOMO drive the price up. Jan calls with a strike of $125 or $130 look pretty good. High volume and very affordable premium. If you're feeling bullish and poor go for the $140C.

TL:DR: Buy AAPL calls at least 60 days out. 01/15 $130C",22,0.85

2020-09-09 21:10:23,PTON & AAPL Tendies,"TLDR: PTON will likely moon taking center stage at AAPL Watch event with integration made possible via GymKit.. Investor presentation at same time as AAPL event. Positions below. 

Anyone see PTON is having a virtual analyst and investor [presentation](https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-interactive-inc-host-virtual-investor-and-analyst) beginning at the exact same time on Tuesday that AAPL is starting their Watch event... purely a coincidence??? I think not..

According to 9to5Mac, the new PTON bike will additionally feature Apple’s [Gym Kit](https://www.google.com/amp/s/9to5mac.com/2020/09/08/peloton-launches-new-bike-gymkit-apple-watch/amp/).. allowing for “deeper integration with the Apple Watch, allowing for one-tap Apple Watch connectivity and heart rate tracking...” 

That said I think we see a PTON mention during the AAPL event, especially given the current global situation. 

I bet you AAPL will additionally make a TV spot featuring at least one new PTON product and it’s integration with the new watch. 

Remember the AAPL Watch has always been branded as a watch that has health/fitness capabilities. PTON has been and is the center of fitness at home equipment and even now fitness classes during this pandemic. If there’s ever been an opportunity for them to work together, it’s now. 

My positions are posted below, and keep in mind PTON ER is tomorrow AH.. all I know so far is upgrades up the wazoo the past few days, production is now to run 24hrs a day now to meet demand for bikes, and we have new/cheaper products...

- ORCL: “Oracle shares rose as much as 6% in extended trading on Thursday after the software maker reported fiscal first-quarter earnings and quarterly guidance that were better than analysts had expected” [CNBC]. I’m looking at short-term weekly or potentially even daily calls that could be entered at market open as an earnings continuation play if the overall market is trending upwards.

- PTON: “Peloton crushes estimates as sales surge 172%, expects strong demand to continue into 2021. With such strong demand for its bike and treadmill, it said it doesn’t expect to return to “normalized order-to-delivery windows” in the U.S. before the end of the fiscal second quarter” [CNBC]. I suggested this as an earnings run-up play and we could now potentially play this similar to ORCL as mentioned above. Slightly OTM weekly calls at market open if the overall market sentiment is positive might be a viable option. These could be sold as early as end of day tomorrow.

- AAPL: Apple continued to sell-off today after yesterday bounce-back and has established itself as the QQQ momentum leader over the last days. Short-term calls or puts depending on market sentiment at open might be a viable trade.

- NKLA: Nikola might be the most overvalued company with a market cap > $10B in the US market. I am expecting yesterday’s sell-off to continue and I am looking at short-term OTM puts >$30 that could be flipped before market close.

Straight profit.

#TLDR for u/rowdygentleman1 and his Eskimo Bros:
#AAPL is splitting 4:1 to let the gig economy workers get in on the ownership.  Why would very wealthy investors want very poor investors to come in and take a very valuable bag off their hands? The game is called when to exit.  AAPL climbs before or after split (maybe both), and drops as the rich get up from the table.  Time it right to get out before they do.  Or run with the bull pen to $150 EOY.

** *Post Continues* **

Google says a stock split is a neutral event.  Bullshit.  No one rich does anything except for them and they boys goin' get richer.  Tim not-Cook-the-books says a 4:1 split will allow more people to participate in owning Apple stock.  This implies that he sees an advantage to an over-valued Titan class tech stock being easier to own by retail investors (compared to Google, Tesla, Amazon,... Berkshire Hathaway).  Let's get real.  Retail invest investors can already buy fractional shares on the easiest app to download onto an apple iphone.  Does he think that more people would choose to buy AAPL over GOOGL or AMZN or MSFT or even NFLX?  Or that dumbass retail investors will think going from $100 --> $120 is the same as running from $380 --> $400?

In these instances, the post-split stock would quickly run up faster than pre-split, allowing Industry and Oligarchs to slip out the back door without crashing the retail party.  Then us bagholders wonder why AAPL can't climb above $125 for the next decade.

Speaking of Berkshire.  How much AAPL is coursing through Omaha's ground water?  Google says 245M shares (5.6%). Interesting. Vanguard Group owns 7.3% [and Vanguard owns 9.5% of itself, that means that Vanguard investors that own AAPL are double positioned on to AAPL].  No Ducking way these guys are pushing Tim Cook to help the small guys make money.

Assuming that AVD and BRK know the music is slowing down and they need someone to dance while they slip out the back, and assuming that a lower bar to entry means dumber, eager buyers, I present three scenarios:

1.  Stock runs up in anticipation of the split.  A future cheaper price means more investors will buy in after the split, effectively allowing current white collars to buy in bulk at a discount now over competing with the filthy wage earners later.  AVD and BRK start paring down their piggy bank.  Ease it out a few million shares a week.  Once we realize they are gone we just sit in a sideways party together.

2.  Stock is sideways to split.  Google says a stock split is neutral so nobody panics.  Inside their corner offices, V and BRK are shitting their pants.  What if retail doesn't show.  Trump might try to push off the elections and deploy BORTAC to quell transgender bathroom users in Arizona.  Retail is too busy with other shit to get a rise out of AAPL.  Once the split happens, AVD and BRK GTFO as the newest WSB boys show up to YOLO 5DTE $150 Calls.  Stock drops.  Theta gang has to payout $90 to own $80 stock.  Then they start selling $91 Calls, but WSB already YOLO'd.

#3.  AAPL runs up like #1, but then falls like #2.  Probably something to do with AVD and BRK earning statements coming out or they need to buy a shit ton of farmland from retirees right now and don't have time to tiptoe out the back.

To me, it seems impossible that AAPL drops back sub $400.  4:1, August (4x2 month) 24 (twentieth plus fourth day).  The numerology is there.  Not going below $400.  It also seems impossible to me that we will continue to see 83% annual gains for AAPL after the retail fuck-bois drive up the post split price.  I won't get a bear tatoo, but I think this split is a sign of the smart money trying to sneak out. (I've said that like five times now.)

What do you think?  I'm cashing out my $380/$400 spread ASAP and then going to stare deeply into a JPOW deepfake to internalize whether I'm more afraid of bagholding or gaining massive tendies ala TSLA.

I/pootytang13- asks a great question:

>You realize Apple continues to increase their stock buybacks? They already bought back 480 billion dollars worth. Why would they stop after the split? Why would institutions get out ??

*I typed out a response, and then realized my answers were much longer than the questions. So I place them below.*

All good questions. Why does a company buy back stock? As a way to deliver rewards to investors via capital gains. Obviously they could instead pay a larger dividend, but the decision to purchase stock means the most influential investors (the ones with the real say in the company) have a preference for higher share prices over straight receipt of cash.

I never implied that Apple would discontinue their buyback program. Indeed the safest place for a mountain of dollars in a inflationary environment is in a capital asset. Apple is keenly at risk as their hoard is legendary.

Finally, why would the largest institutions want to pare down their AAPL holdings? We already discussed the dividend being low priority in a inflationary environment. So we can assume they aren't cashing out to swim in a pool of golden dollars. The two alternatives I posit are 1) stay vested or even double down, 2) find larger earnings elsewhere. 

Did you know the real growth is not in the stock market? In fact, one could say the stock market is smaller than it's ever been in terms of businesses present. The real money is in private equity. You have to know someone to get in. You have to bring real money to get in. Not our dumbass $400/share. Think BRK/A scale.

Perhaps the largest institutional investigators want to draw even more retail investment into AAPL just to see big gains. Or perhaps as the real economy crashes, capital intensive shit like farms and railroad are beginning to sell for discounts. Shit we will need when people can get back to work. Maybe now is the time to slide out of the hyper-valued tech sector and pick up the actual levers of industry.

Or maybe they (the influential investors) simply see the opportunity to personally gain from high share holdings.  A la Pump no dump.  Their separate business models may indirectly benefit from a high AAPL valuation. However a straight Pump implies that the valuation will pause or slowly settle to pre-pump excitement, meaning their indirect benefit must have short term goals.  Think CEO/CFO bonus benchmarks like Musk just scored.",24,0.78
2020-08-19 18:06:23,PSA: AAPL 8/24 & TSLA 8/21 are the Split Shareholder of Record Dates,"Apple Inc. (AAPL) recently announced a 4-for-1 stock split.

If you own 1 options call controlling 100 shares with a strike price of $1,500, after the split you would own 5 contracts and control 500 shares at a $300 strike price.
