2021-02-08 04:47:25,Weekly Stock Market News🚀 | GOOG / AMZN / PINS / SQ / PYPL / COST & other Stock Market News [02-08]🚀,"**The stock market finished a terrific week at record highs🚀🚀🚀 Companies like Google, Pinterest, Amazon & others smash earnings reports while Jeff Bezos bows out🚀🚀🚀 Let’s talk about this & other stock market news**

Hello everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of last week, as we saw all 3 major indexes finish the week with big gains with the SP500 & Nasdaq Composite finishing at new record highs while the Dow Jones did also rise for 5 straight sessions. For the week the [DOW](https://imgur.com/NQpg47q) gained 3.9%, the [SP500](https://imgur.com/cY3wx9N) rose by 4.65% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://imgur.com/T5qgyg5) outperformed gaining just over 6% in what was the best week since early November 🚀🚀🚀

The Volatility [Index](https://imgur.com/Ki1RNHZ) dropped every day last week as it now seats just above 20, with this being a huge level that hasn’t been broken in a long while.

We saw all 11 [SECTORS](https://imgur.com/pp8DYTh) finish the week in the green, with Energy leading the way followed by Consumer Discretionary, Communications & Financials also gaining more than 6% 🚀

[Here](https://imgur.com/tRRK4fZ) is the HEAT MAP from last week, as we saw a hole lot of green in pretty much every sector, with big tech names gaining huge while the biggest lagging sector was Health Care. The big tech names just continue to [increase](https://imgur.com/96Q4J9w) their % of the SP market cap as technology is likely to continue to be one of the best performers in the next decades.

We also saw some interest economic data last week, as manufacturing continue to recover in January as both the [ISM](https://imgur.com/Q9ZPnxF) index and the [PMI](https://imgur.com/nVz0oDe) Index came in pretty solid and continued to stand in expansion territory.

Also, the [ISM](https://imgur.com/jgJ2IbI) Services Index came in better-than-expected rising above expectations due to an increase in employment & new orders.

In terms of Job numbers, we saw [ADP](https://imgur.com/a39dqcB) coming in way better than expected as over 170K jobs were added after a big drop in December. We also saw initial jobless [claims](https://imgur.com/ftMXubP) dropping even more than expected while the continuing jobless claims fell to under 4.6M last week.

This [WEEK](https://imgur.com/vLr3QHG) is pretty quiet in term of economic data, with core CPI, Consumer indexes and jobless numbers being the biggest ones while the [EARNINGS](https://imgur.com/PMP5olx) season continues with some of the most interesting earnings coming from Twitter, Coca-Cola, GM, Uber & PepsiCo while we also have to see how Disney subscriber numbers are continuing to evolve after hugely upgrading their expectations. One other thing that I am also interested to watch is the PayPal investors day on Thursday in which they are expected to provide a 3-to-5-year financial outlook.

In some other stock market [news](https://imgur.com/EcqHtMU), it seems that most of the RBNHD retail investors that have jumped ship are going to Square’s Cash APP with almost 40% of investors choosing the app. We have to see if this trend continues now, after [RBNHD](https://imgur.com/joQIln0) removed limits on all stocks, but regardless, I think Square is a nice FinTech play despite their huge valuation right now, as they will also benefit from the jump in digital currencies and more companies planning to increase investments in integrated POS providers just like Square 🚀

We also had a lot of interesting earnings last week with Amazon [crushing](https://imgur.com/GILwN3r) expectations, beating by almost $7 and almost $6B on revenues as this was the first time Amazon passed the $100B mark in a quarter as the holiday & e-commerce demand combined to give Amazon a 44% increase y/y in sales. The other big [thing](https://imgur.com/WMmAddL) we got from Amazon was that Bezos will step down as CEO as Andy Jassy the current AWS leader will become the next CEO. This news caused some uncertainty for the company, but I believe this is still a long-term buying opportunity as Amazon will remain one of the best companies to own in the world 🚀

Also, one of the biggest fintech companies out there, [PayPal](https://imgur.com/Klv5tD6) showed great strength in their numbers, beating both the top & bottom line as their total payment volume and new active accounts showed continued strength in the move to more & more online payments solutions 🚀

The other big earnings report we saw last week was from [Alphabet](https://imgur.com/5BOUPT0), which also beat by more than $6 and $4B in revenues as they surprised most of the analysts with great beats in most of the segments as their operating margin came in 5% better than expected. The biggest income generator remained the Search & YouTube business as they are still investing huge in their Cloud platform that is still bleeding money, but is very likely to pay out in the long-run 🚀

Other companies also smashed earnings with [Pinterest](https://imgur.com/0zB9SPh) beating expectations after a 76% revenue growth and a 37% user growth while [Ford](https://imgur.com/zerclC2), which was expected to post a loss, turned out positive earnings of $0.43 despite a 9% decrease y/y in total revenues, as the last 2 quarters of the year provided strong evidence that Ford is progressing into turning around the company🚀🚀

Meanwhile, though they didn’t have an earnings report, [COSTCO](https://imgur.com/6UmGJ7x) reported a rise in sales of almost 18% in January as the total comparable same store sales which rose by 15.9% crushed the analyst expectations of just 11.7%. I believe Costco is one of the best retailers to own despite it trading always at a premium, as the company is also jumping on the e-commerce trend, with a 107% increase in e-commerce sales in January🚀

And finally, let’s hope for a good day as the [world](https://imgur.com/itl9KxB) stock markets and the US [Futures](https://imgur.com/mlrfLz5) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way after the Treasury Secretary [pushed](https://imgur.com/jfKvaev) for more fiscal aid to help the economy & the unemployment fully recover as fast as possible.

Lots of words below, so here’s the TL;DRs, Table of Contents, a self dox, and position disclosure before my DD.

**TL;DR #1**: After watching Demo Day twice, I am blown away at how much Palantir’s products have matured in the last 6 years since I left Palantir. I find the new UX far superior to offerings from GOOG, MSFT, and CRM. Apollo is absolutely incredible, and it’s going where no clouds have gone before… from Humvees to nuclear submarines. Lastly, it is clear to me that PLTR has invested heavily in best-of-class administrative tools to improve the speed to deploy Palantir. Bottom line: I fully understand why IBM gave up fighting Palantir and is now selling Palantir Foundry to IBM clients.

PLTR when I left in 2015 versus the Palantir I saw on Demo Day:

[You've come a long way baby.](https://preview.redd.it/fuvi00aejph61.jpg?width=1182&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d993cff432e6b8f49b6728ac4d180cbbb2979080)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #2:** IBM just surrendered to PLTR. In the words of POTUS, this is a…

# Big.

# Fucking.

# Deal.

To put it politely, IBM and Palantir don’t have a very good past relationship. So the fact that IBM is now pushing Foundry means one thing: Foundry is so unfuckwithable that IBM was losing numerous contracts to Foundry-wielding competitors and IBM had no choice but to swallow their pride and cut a deal with Papa Karp.

* First they ignore you.
* Then they laugh at you.
* Then they fight you.
* Then they surrender to you and sign a deal to slang Foundry to thousands of clients in 180 countries.
* Then they send your shareholders tendies for decades.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #3:** Regardless of how ‘good’ or ‘bad’ the 2020 earnings are tomorrow, I find the news from early 2021 to be an incredibly strong signal pointing to an eventual $250B+ market cap for Palantir – BP renewing their enterprise deal, Rio Tinto and PG&E signing a new enterprise deals, AT&T aggressively hiring for Palantir skills, and 2,500 IBMers now pushing Foundry to clients all over the world, etc. IE the tea leaves I'm reading point to strong growth in 2021 and beyond.

It's also worth mentioning that many of the new commercial clients have some of the most difficult and complex supply chains in the world.

If they’re in, I’m in.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #4**: Eventually, institutional traders will comprehend the immense long-term value of ~~Planeteer~~ ~~Planter~~ Palantir and the stock will join the PFAANG club (though I vote that we rename it the FAAPNG club).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Because there are so many shills, pumpers, and bullshiters on WSB these days, I’ll self dox myself. I’m Jason Payne. I joined Palantir in early 2007, when it was a few dozen geeks with big dreams, and left in 2015 to become the CEO of [Ada Diamonds](https://www.adadiamonds.com/) (hence my username).

I joined Reddit to do an official [AMA on laboratory-grown diamonds](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8pb8d5/i_grow_diamonds_i_make_custom_jewelry_with_these/) a few years ago that hit the front page, stuck around, and have absolutely fallen in love with the Reddit community. Thus, I want to give back to my fellow Redditors with a bunch of words and a few pictures to explain Palantir from the perspective of a former employee.

You may think that I’m a Palantir sock puppet given how my bullish I am in this DD. I’m not. Turns out I have a DD-writing fetish. Don’t kink shame. [Here’s a couple of my prior DDs](https://medium.com/@Jason_Payne) on De Beers, Tiffany & Co., and the FTC.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Positions or ban:** At the current PLTR share price, I hold a Keyser Söze position - I could sell out this week and simply walk off into the sunset. But I’m not going to. I have yet to sell all of my unlocked 20%, and I plan to mostly diamond hands my soon-to-be-unlocked 80%, with a decade long diversification plan to exit my concentrated stock position, regardless of earnings tomorrow.

Why? I like the stock, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#1) Praise & Constructive Criticism for Demo Day**

Existentially, Demo Day was incredibly impressive. This thread with u/namingisreallyhard, u/DentalFox, and u/jamauer sums it up:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d0p7dwzijph61.jpg?width=526&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9caa7b51ca8f7c2315988eda62f4afa7f30f7b07

Four things stood out to me:

**Superior Design Language to CRM, MSFT, and GOOG:** Palantir has a completely different front-end user experience (UX) than my time at Palantir, that I saw for the first time on Demo Day. I find it practical, beautiful, and efficient.

The design language is called Blueprint Javascript, and it’s built on React, a modern web development platform that Facebook built. Big ups to Palantir for open sourcing BlueprintJS, meaning that anyone can use it: [https://blueprintjs.com/](https://blueprintjs.com/)

Blueprint is a UI toolkit for web development of complex data-dense interfaces for desktop applications. Compared to the cartoonish UX of Salesforce’s Lightning, the flat UX of Google, and the rigid UX of Microsoft Office, I would much prefer to work in Blueprint all day.

I struggle with how spread out Lightning is by default and really appreciated how dense the Blueprint inerfaces are without feeling crowded. Getting that balance right is really difficult.

**Deep Investment in Deployability**: Administrative tools are the unloved stepchild of enterprise software. No-one buys the backend system, so minimal investments are typically made to build the backend tools to run the software.

Salesforce still hasn’t ported their admin tools from their clunky Web 1.0 Salesforce Classic to their more modern Lightning design system. Google’s back end admin tools suck compared to their client facing tools - Gmail, Calendar, AdWords, etc.

The admin tools that Palantir demoed appeared far better than what I use every day to run my Salesforce instance. I bet I could do most tasks in Foundry 40-75% faster than Salesforce.

**Migration from ‘*****Find the Terrorist*****’ to '*****Cheat Code for War*****':** When I was at Palantir, the primary use case for Gotham was link analysis to find the bad guy. Gotham has clearly evolved from that mission to a far broader set of missions.

Another Redditor described Gotham as ‘cheat code for war,’ and I think that is spot on. That’s why Palantir has won so many different logistics, mission planning, command and control, etc. military contracts recently, including the Space Force

**DoD IL-6 SaaS Approval:** Palantir moving to IL-6 approval could be an entire massive DD on its own, but I’ll keep it short. It’s a big fucking deal to get Apollo running on classified networks, and Palantir is far ahead of the other big SaaS players in this approval:

https://preview.redd.it/hl1j7wwkjph61.jpg?width=1314&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4dc190a30dc75e8d66bcd6c8ab74cb42472137d

Now that I have fanboied on Demo Day I want to be critical of the presentation style of Demo Day. I’d give the presenters a C+ at best. I found it rushed, confusing, and difficult to follow. I had to watch it twice to fully absorb the content, and I’ve given 500+ Palantir demos in my lifetime! My constructive criticism:

* Slow down 15-20%
* Err on the side of a simpler, more approachable lexicon
* For the love of God, stop reading from scripts. Use bullet points
* Handoffs were way to abrupt. Take a deep breath between presenters for us to get prepared for a new topic
* Get better microphones and Snowsound panels for future presentations
* Get a professional public speaking coach involved in rehearsals

I’m not alone in my take on Demo Day. Here are a few unprompted DMs I got from random Redditors on the presentation:

>*· I don't know if it is just me, but I genuinely felt like I was watching a haphazard presentation that didn't really do justice nor capture attention in a lucrative way*  
>  
>*· It lacked charisma and charm, and it felt cobbled together like a group project by university students*  
>  
>*· I was watching the demo day presentation, and left feeling underwhelmed. It may have been impressive to someone who is in the industry, but from someone outside of it, it all sounded greek to me.*  
>  
>*· I felt like the Gotham team was clearly the A team and Foundry needs better presentation skills.*

I know my last PLTR DD made the rounds at Palantir, so here’s a direct message to those behind Demo Day - if everyone told you that you ‘*killed it*,’ you \*really\* need to find someone in the organization willing to speak truth to power.

\_\_\_\_\_

**#2) Why Palantir is a Diamond Fisted Iron Man Suit**

One of the Demo Day presenters made an interesting comment that stuck with me: At Palantir, we build Iron Man suits, not robots.

No, Palantir does not have a skunk works program building flying mech suits (AFAIK).

Palantir builds *cerebral* cyborgs, not *physical* cyborgs. Palantir’s products create a symbiotic relationship between human beings and computers to better solve *cerebral* tasks, not *physical* tasks.

&#x200B;

[Iron Man. Cerebral Edition.](https://preview.redd.it/77xps5ipjph61.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb3acbee813e27ca69f7b94c9158fba44c6e142a)

If you have not watched Demo Day yet (or you rewatch it), listen for how many times they say the words ‘decision’ and ‘decision makers.’

Why a **diamond fisted** Iron Man suit? Palantir just closed an enterprise deal with Rio Tinto, who is the 3rd largest diamond producer in the world. So Rio Tinto will be using their PLTR-powered Iron Man suits to dig for fistfuls of diamonds on multiple continents.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**#3) The True ROI of Palantir**

Palantir is really expensive. No question about it.

But you know what’s more expensive than Palantir? Bad Decisions. Being wrong is really, really expensive. See the Airbus 380, Microsoft’s market share of cell phones, the Golden State Warriors drafting Todd Fuller over Kobe Bryant, shorting GME in early January, and BMW/Mercedes/Lexus’s dismissal of TSLA.

The true ROI of Palantir is substantially better decision making across your organization. Even a moderate improvement in decision making creates deep fucking value for an organization.

For example, Airbus claims that Foundry helped them improved the speed of A350 production by 33%. There are 5 million discrete parts in an A350, and the Foundry-powered decisions led to a 33% improvement in production. Palantir doesn’t make that claim. Airbus makes that claim. That’s absolutely bonkers and that’s why this is no surprise:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ns8wcvvsjph61.jpg?width=675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fb13831b6f18b58f53fa5131f6543e950e8569f

The BP renewal and the new deals (PG&E, Rio Tinto, Fiat, etc) prove u/petroduct is right. If you have complex logistics, you should have Foundry.

Say that Palantir improves the quality of decisions made at United Airlines by 6.9%. How much will the UAL stock appreciate over the next decade? If Palantir helps Rio Tinto improve decision making by 4.20%, how much will their bottom line grow by 2025?

Below are a few excerpts from United's Director of Technical Operations on how they use Foundry. This is just scratching the surface of how an airline can use Palantir to improve operations; however, if each of these models/decisions are incrementally improved, even a little bit, the value to United is fucking deep.

The entire blog post is a great read if you want to go deeper on Foundry: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/)

>*\[minor edits for brevity\]*  
>  
>*The return-to-service model recommends which specific aircraft to return at which time in the future and how to utilize our available maintenance capacity (internal & external) to ensure they’re airworthy when we need them. Since we don’t know when air travel demand will recover, the models need to account for slow recoveries, fast recoveries, and everything in between.*  
>  
>*Our optimization models consider when “big events” (airframe checks, engine overhauls, and landing gear overhauls) will be due, along with the cost of those events and the available maintenance capacity to complete them. The models also incorporate other factors: parts availability and cost, available technician hours at each maintenance station, ability to secure supplemental maintenance lines at external MRO providers, aircraft-specific mechanical reliability and on-time performance, and even the quality of the in-flight products (seats, Wi-Fi, entertainment, power outlets).*  
>  
>*The team is also helping optimize the cycling of active and parked aircraft whenever we have surplus planes available to fly, which ensures regulatory compliance with the maintenance program, minimizes operating costs, and enables our Tech Ops team to be very intentional about balancing our operational objectives – do we want to fly the most reliable aircraft, the lowest cost aircraft, or the aircraft with the most time left until its next major maintenance event?*

&#x200B;

**#4) Muthafuckin’ Clouds in Nuclear Submarines**

Toward the end of the Apollo demo, one of the presenters offhandedly mentioned something that caused my jaw to hit the floor: Palantir will be deploying Apollo on US Navy submarines.

IL-6. Clouds. In. Nuclear. Submarines.

As someone who has installed and managed Palantir servers in server rooms all over the world, I can’t state how huge it is that the US Navy is approving the Apollo modular cloud architecture to be deployed on some of their most sensitive and expensive assets.

The fact that upgrades to the entire fleet can be managed like upgrading an AWS server?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mvmtqwdvjph61.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef22d9c598c63b3bd4e488b8439bc4082ff9f5ba

\_\_\_\_\_

**#5) Does it Matter that Palantir Needs FDEs at Deployments?**

One of the favorite arguments of the Palantir bears is that Palantir is an unscalable, overvalued services company that should have the same P/E as Accenture, Booz, BAE, etc. The bears say that Palantir only has a handful of clients and can’t scale. In my mind, the quality of the admin tools show on Demo Day and the IBM partnership announcement eviscerated that argument.

When I was at Palantir, it was a bitch to build and manage deployments. From what I saw on Demo Day, Palantir is now easier than Salesforce to deploy. I say that as someone who has written tens of thousands of lines of code for Salesforce (Lightning, Apex, SOQL and Visualforce).

Eventually, Palantir will have the same ecosphere of 3rd party developers that deploy and manage instances of SAP, Salesforce, Microsoft, etc. but that will take years to fully mature that ecosphere. Eventually, Palantir will have robust certifications for various skills and tasks to manage Palantir deployments.

But in the meantime, Palantir's Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) will continue to directly manage deployments. Given how much progress Palantir has made on the tools to improve the efficiency of the FDEs, I no longer worry about the scalability of that team.

Say that three utility companies all buy Palantir – PG&E, ConEd, and Entergy.  Palantir invests 4 years worth of FDE time in PG&E, 1 year in ConEd, and none in Entergy.

* PG&E improves decision making by 10% and does a massive enterprise deal with Palantir to deploy to every part of the organization.
* ConEd improves decision making by 2% and does a moderate renewal for a few specific teams.
* Entergy bungles their deployment and actually makes worse decision as a result. They do not renew.

Assuming \~$500k/year all in is the cost for a good FDE at Palantir, we're talking about small up front investments that return bigly for PLTR in the long run as those deployments are extended like the BP deal.

To put it another way, when you think about Palantir deployments in months or years, the FDE overhead is spooky. But when you think about those deployments converting into decade long *operating system for XXXXXX* deals, the FDE overhead is not significant.

Also, to be honest, there are very few people with TS/SCI security clearances that even know what React is, much less how to write code against it, so in some of the more sensitive use cases for Palantir, I think that FDEs will be the way for a long time.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#6) Should you YOLO on PLTR?**

I’m not going to give anyone financial advice, but I do want to point out a few things:

PLTR is not a meme stock. Palantir is not a small-cap that can move bigly because, a bunch of furry quadrupeds gathering on internet messaging boards collectively decide that we like the stock.

Palantir is a bunch of wickedly smart people building Iron Man suits for the largest, most important organizations in the world.

Many of the larger institutional investors still don’t truly comprehend Palantir and the medium term public valuation may not properly reflect the present and future value created by Palantir. I have no idea when the analysts will finally get the value of PLTR.

A lot of historically successful investors think PLTR is extremely overvalued. They may be right.

A lot of historically successful investors have massive positions long PLTR. CathThey may be right.

So my crystal ball says PLTR may go up, down, or sideways for longer than you can stay solvent or interested in Karp memes.

Regardless of the ticker, if you YOLO, please YOLO responsibly my friends, and for the love of god take some off the table if/when you’re fortunate enough to have green dildoes in your accounts– whether your gains are from PLTR or any other stock you happen to like, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#7) My Appreciation for the Palantir Team**

I do want to take a moment and say to anyone who has been a part of building Palantir over the last few decades: what you have built is incredible. Thank you. As an American, thank you. As a stockholder, thank you.

Enjoy your tendies, you’ve earned them my friends.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#8) How I Play My Lockup**

Regardless of how the markets view the earnings report tomorrow, I’m largely HODLing my remaining Palantir shares, as I think Palantir is in a class of it’s own, lapping the competition like SpaceX and Tesla.

I do have a professional advisor and we have prepared tax-optimized divestment strategies for a number of scenarios, but none of those scenarios involve paper handing out of my remaining position, regardless of a good, bad, or ugly response to the 2020 earnings report tomorrow.

Why would I sell now if I believe that FAANG-like is growth coming over the next 10 years? Why would I sell when I think Palantir in 2021 is like Mercedes F1 in 2014 about to go on a worldwide domination over the next few years? Also, with the shares finally unlocked, I can borrow against them for the first time.

I've already responsibly taken enough off the table pre-IPO, so I’m not in any rush to sell. My first substantial limit order will be at a market cap of \~$100B with a ladder up to \~$250B. So I’m skeptical that I’ll sell any more than 5% of my remaining shares this week.

That’s my $0.02 on Demo Day and some of the recent news.

So long, and thanks for all the tendies. See ya at the restaurant at the end of the universe PLTR gang!

2020-04-25 11:51:49,Anecdotal evidence of how $GOOG is doing going into earnings...,"Just had a friend tell me his Google AdSense account was recently un-banned after being banned for 6+ years. Anyone who knows AdSense knows they NEVER lift bans... EVER.... for pretty much ANY reason... much less 6+ years later for no reason.

They are BEYOND hurting for revenue if they're opening back up banned AdSense accounts. They were banned for a reason... mostly click fraud, but in general, these accounts were flagged as posing a danger to their advertisers (either malware, spyware, click fraud, lead fraud, impression fraud, suspect or lacking content, etc). This could be a short-term boon to their revenues, but *definitely* poses a long-term danger to the rates Google can charge. Mostly though, the fact they are even taking this course of actions means they are *needing* to scrape the bottom of the barrel for every bit of revenue they can find.... even if it's less than ""legitimate"" and not good long-term for them *or* their advertisers.

2021-02-14 06:19:23,Why I think AMD is going up a lot soon,"Corona\`s main economic impact is supply chain disruptions that are unprecedented. Before Covid supply chain was running smooth as a glove, think of it as a highway full of cars flowing at exact same speed and spaced equally. This supply chain was being perfected for over a decade. And then this shitstorm happened. The highway is clogged, ships are standing loaded with crap they cannot effectively unload quick enough, there aren\`t enough ships to move products that are needed. Including basic materials for industries and intermediate components to make a final product.

For those who don\`t know, there is an absolute chip shortage in the market right now. Spanning from AMD/NVDA CPUs and GPUs, to auto chips, to new consoles, and any kind of electronics. Even AAPL will have sales issues this quarter caused by the chip shortage.

The main chip producer TSMC is ramping up CAPEX to $28 billion, including $12 bn for their US plant.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/tsmc-profit-beats-expectations-as-chipmaker-widens-tech-lead](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/tsmc-profit-beats-expectations-as-chipmaker-widens-tech-lead) 

The perfect storm is brewing for NVDA and AMD to gain enormously from this market, but in my opinion AMD will end up with upper hand, let me explain.

&#x200B;

1. Back in 2017/2018 year old GPUs were selling over on Amazon and elsewhere for double their MSRP. These were old graphic cards! their price should have depreciated over time, but didn\`t. Why? Cause of B T C. Miners were buying that shit by bulks. Guess what? We\`re at the exact same situation right now, except that price of that thingy is now $50k! and with new cards being more cost effective you wouldn\`t be able to buy ANY right now even if you wanted it to simply upgrade your PC and play something. As a matter of fact try to buy GTX 10xx or RTX 20xx gen on Amazon, there are NONE! So its not only the latest gen that\`s unavailable, its ALL of them. And CPUs have the exact same problem, which wasn\`t so bad in 2018. And soon you might find it impossible to buy even any laptop having latest chip: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156)
2. Not long ago NVDA announced $40 bn acquisition of ARM which would ensure they have access to state of the art IP which would make them future chip behemoth, and not surprisingly the largest companies in the world are now lobbying against that [https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns) . With this in mind, its becoming increasingly likely the acquisition wont go through. On the other hand, AMD replied with the acquisition of XLNX which seems wouldn\`t be such an issue considering AMD is way smaller than NVDA or INTC.
3. AMD and QCOM are actively lobbying US gov to address the issue, which they will. What to expect? Quite likely to remove previous trade policies regarding chips - resulting in easier access and higher/cheaper volume of chips being produced overseas. Which would mean AMD can ramp up production and meet the huge current demand of data centers and whoever needs their GPU. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage) . 
4. Price action - stocks follow certain pattern. They kinda wobble within some range for long period of time, 6-18 months, this is where a lot of accumulation by big players happen, and fundamentals kind of crystalize. Once the conditions are right, the stock can shoot 50% in a span of a month and then hover on new level for considerable time. Look at the chart of TSLA 2015-2019, NVDA numerous times, AMZN, GOOG, etc. Right now, NVDA is up already 20% in the last month. I believe the market will look from NVDA to AMD very soon, given points 2-3 and major holders wont be willing to sell for current price.

To recap what is the perfect storm. In 2017/18 chip shortage was caused mainly by A. the thing we dont mention here, right now its also B. new consoles cant be produced fast enough, C. supply chain issues which might be resolved soon, C. simply way bigger improvement in new CPUs/GPUs hence new upgrade cycle coupled with corporate upgrade cycle due to COVID

2021-02-12 23:00:16,$TSLA is positioned for a massive reversal,"Tesla's current market cap is the result of multiple positive feedback loops which has pushed its price to a ludicrous level via Short + Gamma Squeezes (it is also important to note virtually all TSLA shorts are out^(1)). This campaign has been largely led by large hedge funds. Without S&P inclusion, the story might have ended there with hedge funds trying to escape with their profits and leaving retail the bag. However, S&P inclusion presented these hedge funds with a much better option to close out their positions while also riding the stock down. The shares that hedge funds no longer wanted began to be picked up by passive funds leading to selloffs by the active funds which pushed prices to this level.

&#x200B;

With passive funds holding the bag, the hedge funds which lead the rally seem to be attempting to push the price back down through a reverse gamma squeeze^(2).

No retail trader is buying 1m+ in deep OTM puts, this is an attempt by hedgies to push the price down.

We can also see this from the massive shift in options volume. $190B of calls open interest and over $250B of puts open interest, a massive put skew. This is especially significant because ""To put it in context it is equal to the combined $AAPL and $AMZN bullish skew or if you’d rather to the combined  $BABA, $FB, $MSFT, $GOOG and $WMT combined."" reflecting extremely bearish sentiment in an very very bullish market.

Once the reversal begins there will be nothing stopping it as OTM puts get less and less OTM. There are no shorts left to be squeezed and the bag holding passive funds which are largely barred from holding derivatives will have no way of rebalancing the options skew.

Understanding The Market Requires You To Understand Market Psychology

Check out my profile for stock Analysis by request.

Stock market intraday patterns – all times are in Eastern Standard Time!

When day trading the US stock market you may notice certain patterns, based on the time of day, that occur more often than not. These patterns, or tendencies, happen often enough for professional day traders to base their trading around them.

9:30am: The stock market opens, and there is an initial push in one direction. Highly volatile!

9:45am: The initial push often sees a significant reversal or pullback. This is often just a short-term shift, and then the original trending direction re-asserts itself.

10:00am: If the trend that began at 9:30am is still happening, it will often be challenged around this time. This tends to be another time where there is a significant reversal or pullback.

11:15am-11:30am: The market is heading into lunch hour, and London is getting ready to close. This is when volatility will typically die out for a few hours, but often the daily high or low will be tested around this time. European traders will usually close out positions or accumulate a position before they finish for the day. Whether the highs or lows are tested or not, the markets tend to ‘drift’ for the next hour or more.

11:45am-1:30pm: This is lunch time in New York, plus a bit of a time buffer. Usually, this is the quietest time of the day, and often, day traders like to avoid it.

1:30pm-2:00pm: If the lunch hour was calm, then expect a breakout of the range established during lunch hour. Often, the market will try to move in the direction it was trading in before the lunch hour doldrums set in.

2:00pm-2:45pm: The close is getting closer, and many traders are trading with the trend thinking it will continue into close. That may happen, but expect some sharp reversals around this time, because on the flip side, man traders are quicker to take profits or move their trailing stop losses closer to the current price.

\---

3:00pm-3:30pm: These are big “Shake-out” points, in that they will force many traders out of their positions. If a reversal of the prior trend occurs around this time, then the price is likely to move very strongly in the opposite direction. Even if the prior trend does sustain itself through these periods, expect some quick and sizable counter-trend moves.

As a day trader, its best to be nimble and not get tied into one position or direction. Many traders only trade the first hour and the last hour of every day, as these times are the most volatile.

3:30pm-4:00pm: The market closes at 4pm. After that, the liquidity dries up in nearly all stocks and ETFs, except for the very active ones. It’s common to close all positions a minute or more before the closing bell, unless you have orders placed to close your position on a closing auction or “cross”.

Trade Entry Checklist - Things to Consider before entering a trade

1. Portfolio fit – Make sure you diversify your portfolio. If you have 9 open bullish positions, consider a bearish stance elsewhere to balance your portfolio and reduce risk.
2. Liquidity Check – If the stock you are considering has enough stocks traded per day. This can easily be found on Yahoo! Finance – look for “Average Volume.” Look for contract strikes that have at least 1,000 contracts of open interest – this minimizes bid/ask spread and ensures market liquidity so that you can actually enter/exit trades easily.
3. IV Percentile – Example: AAPL has IV of 45%, but IV percentile of 85%. This means that 85% of the time over the last year, volatility will be lower than it is right now as it’s current actual IV (45%). Likewise, if GOOG has an IV of 45% but an IV rank of 25%, then only 25% of the time over the last year IV was lower than it’s current value (45%). This means we have a 75% chance that IV will increase on average, meaning it’s current volatility is low – and we want to buy into that. If IV is between 70%-100% you will need to actively monitor that trade, higher risk.
4. Options strategy - Pretty straight forward- If IV is high and the price of the underlying is also high, we can eliminate bullish strategies and focus on bearish, and vice versa.
5. Strike Price – First you need to determine if you want an in the money (ITM) or out of the money (OTM). An ITM option has a greater sensitivity – delta – to the price of the underlying stock. So if the stock price increases by a given amount, the ITM call would gain more than an ATM or OTM call. This also means it would decline more than others if the price falls. ITM calls are more expensive as well – higher intrinsic value.

Next consideration is risk/reward. An ITM option carrier less risk, but costs more. If you only want to stake a small amount of capital in a trade, an OTM position may be your best choice. OTM positions are riskier, cheaper, and potentially much more profitable if the stock surges past your strike price.

6. Expiration – Date similarly to strike price, the further out a contracts expiration is, the higher the premium because time is on your side. There is a higher chance of the stock meeting your OTM target price given a year to do so, compared to a week. This is called Theta – a quantification of how much value is lost due to the passing of time. Theta also grows exponentially as you near the expiration date – your $190 strike call will be worth very little if the call expires tomorrow and the stock is at $180 because the probability of the stock reaching $190 is low.

7. Position size – This is important – BIG TRADING POSITIONS WILL EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF BLOWING UP YOUR ACCOUNT. We suggest you place trades utilizing only 1-5% of your total account value, with an emphasis on the lower end. Play it safe, round down. It’s much easier to recover from a -5% loss than -80%.

8. Future moves – Think beyond what’s going on with a stock than just in the current day – unless youre scalping. Is there an earnings report coming up? Can I roll this into the next month if I need to? Is there an upcoming dividend payout? Take the time to plan your positions and don’t rush your entry – You want to ensure the best possibility of success. I’d take $500 profit with a 90% success rate over $750 profit with a 50% success rate any day. You want to build consistency, and plan your positions before you take them.",632,0.89

2021-03-12 12:50:14,$LUMN - Lumen Technologies (Formerly CenturyLink) by u/uknj,"**$LUMN - Lumen Technologies (Formerly CenturyLink) by** u/uknj

Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink) is a telecommunications company which provides products and services related Network, Cloud, Security, Voice, and Managed Services to enterprise, SME, and retail customers. Lumen is aiming to position itself as a key infrastructure partner underpinning public and private cloud, edge computing and fiber connectivity. LUMN is building its services with 4 key areas in mind:

1. Physical assets and infrastructure – These include fiber, hardware and facilities.
2. Software managed networking – This is a network-as-a-service (NaaS) offering that can be leveraged to connect organisations with
3. Hybrid Cloud – These include private cloud and datacentres, colocation services and connections with public cloud service provider partners.
4. Lumen Orchestrator – This is the orchestration solution that allows for the management and control of the various services that are offered.

I am currently bearish about LUMN with no immediate plans to invest (although in the event of the price dropping into the single digits, I would re-evaluate this position). There are a few key reasons for this, but I encourage you to read the full bullish, bearish, and neutral considerations in the rest of the post:

1. LUMN earns a significant portion of its revenues from legacy offerings e.g., traditional telephony. This revenue stream has been decreasing YoY for the last few years and this is likely to continue.
2. Despite the above, there are significant areas of potential for LUMN – specifically in their Edge Computing and software defined networking offerings (see Organisational Summary below). Edge Computing is only a small % of current revenues and while it is likely to grow, it will take time to significantly grow these streams. I view the Edge Computing growth as a slow burner and small market, but this will grow at a rapid rate in the future.
3. LUMN has a high level of debt, and while they have managed to de-lever and reduce interest rates, the amount of debt is still significant. When accounting for intangibles and goodwill, the level of liabilities is roughly 1.6x the value of assets (although specifically looking at long term debt this is a healthier picture at 70% of non-current assets).
4. Revenues have been consecutively down for the last few years and are unlikely to show a significant turnaround next year. This is somewhat mitigated by improvements in margin which are expected to continue and a healthy level of free cash flow at $2,770 although this has been declining YoY.

Please do have a read of the Bull, Bear and Neutral points in the detailed post below for a more balanced and in-depth view.

* EPS = -2.12 (dil)
* Forward P/E = 8.5x

# Detailed Analysis

**Bull Considerations**

* $LUMN are well positioned to become significant players in high potential markets – specifically fiber and underlying network infrastructure, NaaS and Edge computing.
* $LUMN has several verticals it can offer to customers including Hybrid Cloud, Connected Security and Collaboration. These can be leveraged to grow revenue streams in parallel (i.e., cross selling products and services to customers).
* Successfully managed to de-lever the company from previous debts. While this is a great deleveraging trend and a significant reduction in interest rates by redeeming outstanding 5.375% and 7.00% notes1 and replacing them with 4% bonds, the level of debt is still a concern (see bearish consideration item 1).
* The dividend from $LUMN has been consistent and relatively attractive (although on a yield basis this is less so if the price continues to rise). The board are committed to continuing the dividend payment and at the present time it can be safely assumed that $0.25 will be paid per share per quarter for the remainder of FY21. Dividend yield should not be the primary reason for going into $LUMN as yield is \~ 7% (at a stock price of $13.70). In the event of a dip to single digits, the dividend becomes extremely attractive and is worth considering (at a yield of > 9%).
* Despite the overall reduction in EBITDA (see bearish item 4), EBITDA margin has improved and is likely to continue improving into FY21 due to cost cutting measures being pushed by executive leadership.
* Significant number of insider purchases throughout 2020 with one sale.

**Bear Considerations**

* Overall, there are likely to be better candidates for returns on investments than LUMN, while LUMN is in a number of attractive areas, it is still growing revenues and these are unlikely to materialise in any significant manner over the next year or two. See competitive advantage section for additional details.
* $LUMN holds significant long-term debt of $31,837 (down from $34,694 in 2019). This debt is primarily due to $LUMN’s all in play to fiber (at the expense of 5g) when they purchased Level 3 Communications for $34,000. It is worth noting that $LUMN has not had an issue with either paying down debt and paying dividends with its current cash flow.
* $LUMN earns a substantial portion of revenues from legacy services. These include voice ($391 in 4Q20) which approximates to 29% of overall revenue. As can probably be guessed, this has regularly declined over the course of FY20. While not all the voice revenue is likely to be a “legacy” product, I am considering it as such as there are likely to be other legacy revenue streams. (N.B. According to $LUMN legacy revenues primarily include voice, private line (including special access), switched access and other ancillary services.)
* $LUMN is facing lengthening sales cycles for its products and services as their customers (and more likely organisations in general) continue to evaluate new infrastructure needs and delay purchasing unless necessary. This is likely to continue until at least 2022 as cost pressure at organisations globally push down purchases.
* Revenues are down both QoQ and YoY with EBITDA down YoY and there is no expectation that they will increase next year with best estimates at stable revenue / EBITDA and worst-case a reduction. YoY revenues have decreased for both FY20, FY19 and FY18, although the rate of decrease has reduced over time.
* Free cash flow while still high is reducing over time and will continue to do so as LUMN are likely to continue to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and paying off its long-term debt.
* Executive compensation (specifically focussing on CEO compensation) is above average for the industry at $17M (compared to an average of $10M for similar sizes). It is worth noting that when comparing against larger companies or those listed as competitors, this level of compensation was not unusual. Compensation did stabilise as performance dropped, however, no decrease in compensation occurred despite the decrease in earnings. While not initially a problem, if the results do not turn around, and there is no decrease in compensation, there is a concern that executive pay is no longer in line with the company’s results.

**Neutral Considerations**

* Long term credit rating (Moody’s) – Ba3: Speculative with substantial - high credit risk.
* Speculative Grade Liquidity Ratings – SGL-2: Good liquidity, will be able to meet their obligations over the next 12 months through mostly internal resources but may rely on external sources of committed financing.
* Southeastern Asset Management has increased its position in $LUMN as of Dec 2020. It is worth noting that they have lost (\~25%) on the investment to date2. Despite this, they remain bullish on the overall prospects as the CEO has tightened controls on costs and margin improves. Additionally, they believe $LUMN can monetise several segments they are in (specifically fiber), and that as a multiple of free cash flow (< 5 at the time of investing) is an attractive valuation. As a final point, they have signed an NDA with $LUMN, and this indicates a higher and more “activist” level of engagement3. I have listed this as neutral despite the bullish sentiment of SAM, as their track record for the last year has not been great compared to the overall market.
* $LUMN will be seeing reduced subsidy revenue (from CAF II – A US initiative to improve connectivity) with subsidies declining to $20 by 2022. However, $LUMN believes their investment into providing this connectivity is likely to add to revenue that will make up for the loss in subsidy.

# Organisation Summary

Essentially Lumen Combine underlying infrastructure with platforms (i.e., cloud PaaS) and Applications (SaaS):

1. **Adaptive Networking** – High performance network connectivity i.e., on premise private lines, Content Delivery Network, fiber internet connectivity, direct cloud connections (where they provide corporate WAN infrastructure a direct link to Cloud) and managed networking services / consulting.

* Content delivery network market growth is forecast to grow at 14% till 20254.
* Fiber Internet connectivity in the US grew at 12% from 2019-202022 and will likely continue to grow at a similar rate for the next few years. Across the EU growth rates are largely similar for both coverage growth and subscriber growth5.
* Software defined networking offerings (Networking as a service) is an expanding industry and likely to see significant growth of 34% annually till 20266.
* Growth rates and industry sizes for private lines and direct cloud connections are not easily available. I believe direct cloud connections are a growth area and likely to grow at a reasonable 10-15% annually for the next few years (based on over all cloud growth, increase in colocation and deployment of data centres – see Hybrid Cloud below).

1. **Collaboration** \- VOIP, teleconferencing, collaboration solutions (e.g., file sharing and virtual meeting rooms all hosted by Lumen, but the products can be from vendors like Zoom, Webex Skype etc.), contact centres and calling services (e.g., traditional phone style calling both locally and internationally as well as toll free / business numbers. Also advanced emergency services support).

* VOIP is relatively mature industry with a CAGR of 12% (at best) till 20257. Personally, I think we can discount any mobile VOIP growth as I do not believe LUMN has offerings in this space and in my view, this would lower the effective CAGR with 8-10% looking a more reasonable target.
* Call centre growth is forecast to grow at 6% till 20278. The US houses over 60% of call centres globally, and this number is only going to decrease as increased internet penetration and decreased telecom rates drive the outsourcing of call centres9.
* Numbers and growth rates to traditional telephony are limited but I imagine that growth is probably negative. For toll free, business numbers and emergency services support, growth is likely positive but limited.
* Collaboration solutions are growing at a reasonably high rate of 13% till 202710. However, LUMN is limited to managing, implementing, running, and hosting products from other vendors as they do not sell their own.

1. **Connected Security** – Threat management (managed threat intelligence), managed SOC services, WAF and DDoS mitigation, managed firewalls, and professional services.

* The WAF market is expected to grow at 18% annually till 202211.
* The DDoS mitigation market is set to grow at 15% annually till 202612.
* The managed security services are expected to grow at a CAGR of 8% till 202513. While I think managed firewall growth is likely to be less than other managed security services (e.g., IAM, SOC etc), a growth rate of 4-6% is probable.

1. Edge Computing – Managed services, connections to both public cloud and private data centres, networking, colocation, cloud. Essentially connecting edge locations / end user servers to backbone infrastructure.

* Edge computing as an industry is forecast to grow at \~25% annually till 202514. However, it is currently a small market valued at \~ $ 2,000 in 20201. Edge computing as a market can be further subdivided into hardware, platform, and services. Hardware is expected to grow at the fastest rate of the three potentially reaching 40%15.

1. **Hybrid Cloud** – Cloud storage, disaster recovery (data replication and business continuity), hosting services, data centres, private and public cloud alongside consulting for cloud.

* The private cloud market is expected to grow at 29% annually till 2025. Private cloud growth will primarily be driven by businesses who wish to take advantage of public cloud capability with the addition of potentially more secure and customisable hosting resources. On-premises cloud growth will be significantly lower than provider hosted options (PaaS / IaaS) which are likely to hit 50%16.
* Hosting services are likely to increase in market size by 15% annually17.
* Deployment of data centres are likely to increase slowly over the next few years with a growth rate not likely to exceed 10% (estimated at 6% for 202118). Similarly, colocation services are likely to see a modest 14% CAGR19.
* Global cloud storage is expected to increase at a rate of 20% till 202520.

# Competitive Advantage

1. **Adaptive Networking:**

* Summary: A large revenue earner with solid growth potential. $LUMN is a large player in the infrastructure space and should be able to leverage that to provide organisations with NaaS and global fiber connectivity.
* From a coverage perspective (compared to Verizon and AT&T as of 2019), $LUMN serves 16% of the population, with Verizon and AT&T serving 17% and 41% respectively. It is worth noting that $LUMN covers more states than either21, 22. N.B. this view is for consumers but presumably also can also be applied to corporate coverage.
* $LUMN is relatively well positioned from a fiber perspective as they have a lot of “unique coverage” (i.e., locations served without significant competition) in the US and have coverage in Europe and Asia. They carry a large portion of internet traffic on their network backbone and have 180,000 locations globally which provide their customers direct access to $LUMN infrastructure. Additionally, they have direct connectivity to several cloud service providers and data centres. Compared to competitors, they appear to have the largest total fiber route23.
* The software defined networking offerings are an exciting growth opportunity and combined with the strong infrastructure position of $LUMN will mean that customers (particularly those that are multinationals and large enterprises) can utilise the network as a service offering to connect their enterprise infrastructure efficiently and effectively across the globe including connections from on-premises to cloud service providers.
* While competitors do exist, from both a software defined networking perspective (e.g., Fortinet, Cato etc.) and an infrastructure perspective (e.g. Verizon, AT&T etc.) $LUMN has the advantage of being a strong player in both areas with good partnerships with Cisco and VMWare.

1. **Collaboration:**

* Summary: Largely a legacy business and revenue generator for $LUMN. This will be a shrinking revenue area for $LUMN as the decline in traditional legacy telephony services is unlikely to be made up for by any growth in VoIP or collaboration solutions. Additionally, this area is a large revenue earner for $LUMN, and significant declines here would result in material impact to value.
* While implementing and managing VoIP, teleconferencing and collaboration solutions with partnered vendors (e.g., Zoom) are likely to show some little to moderate growth over the coming years, they will likely provide consistent revenue due to the underlying network requirements needed to effectively utilise such solutions.
* Traditional telephony services including contact / service centres and business telephony service revenues are likely to shrink over the coming few years.

1. **Connected Security:**

* Summary: The cybersecurity market is an exciting growth area which holds significant potential for $LUMN. However, it remains a small % of overall revenues and so revenue growth in-line with industry expectation will not materially impact the overall value of $LUMN.
* If $LUMN can leverage their verticals in the datacentre / cloud space to cross sell their security services this could see some reasonably large growth, but overall due to the small footprint of $LUMN in the cloud space presently, material value growth due to this vertical is likely be several years out.
* Additionally, $LUMN is not a recognised global player in this industry unlike Akamai or NetScout, and so will be at a disadvantage compared to incumbents with higher profile portfolios.

1. **Edge Computing:**

* Summary: This could be a strong growth area for $LUMN. Could be a way to take advantage of the potentially significant growth area of Edge computing. However, it is likely to significantly materialise only 1-2 years out with little revenue growth in this area prior to then as organisations slowly accept this paradigm shift. Additionally, it will be a highly competitive area that will require significant investment to grow and maintain an advantage.
* As of 23 Feb 2021, $LUMN claims they provide 60% of enterprise locations with <5ms latency to edge nodes. Their goal is 90% by the end of the year and their large fiber network leaves them at an advantage compared to competitors. (See Adaptive Networking).
* An example from the 4Q20 earnings call was SAP using their Edge infrastructure to bring SaaS applications closer to customers and bypassing unnecessary internet traversal.
* While $LUMN can leverage its underlying infrastructure and assets to push a solid offering, this is likely to be a highly competitive space with players including typical cloud service providers e.g. Microsoft, Amazon, Google and HPE as well as specialised players e.g. Mutable. Large cloud players will have both the hardware and software required to compete effectively with $LUMN while also being able to leverage their substantial public cloud technologies to gain an advantage.

1. **Hybrid Cloud:**

* Summary: If you are interested in taking advantage of private or public cloud growth then Lumen probably is not the best value even at its current multiple. This is due to low revenues (as a % of total revenues) from Cloud related activities. Additionally, this space is highly competitive and $LUMN does not appear to have the background or experience (it is working on growing its employee expertise) although they can potentially take advantage of their underlying infrastructure from their fiber and physical assets.
* Personally, I believe Private Cloud is not a significantly growing area with potentially some shorter term increase due to pandemic pushing a more remote working / access focus. However, longer term 3-5 years out, I think hybrid cloud will be the dominant focus as organisations transition from private cloud to increased public cloud usage. Only 3% of enterprises use private cloud exclusively24.
* If you are going to opt for growth within public cloud, there are higher growth options with AMZN, GOOG and MSFT although these are substantially higher in price. Alternatively, Cisco, HPE, or other smaller providers may work. A dedicated cloud provider will likely provide better value than $LUMN due to the low revenue share (see above).

2021-03-10 14:41:48,"So my monkey brain tried some ""visual analysis"" (aka crayon art) in order to predict the future ... OTHER APES PLSS HELP!!"," 

After todays madness I really needed to figure out what could happen next. My small retard brain couldn't stand the looses while holding - I took major brain dmg while watching the stonk drop like a rock (totally legit) so please excuse my crayon drawings on that.

This is what I found:

This was January 28th when this rocket was about to lift off (not red crayon circles):

&#x200B;

[Picture from first \\""peak\\"" -\> drop on 01\/28 \(THE SQUEEZE WAS NOT SQUOZEN THEN\)](https://preview.redd.it/1uoq1jnm3am61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaef523351178aaf0910e327bab97db35b2a200b)

As you can see GME reached a price of around 419$ per share (\*rocket emoji\*)

This is a picture of todays lift off (once again - red crayon pls):

[Picture from second \\""peak\\"" -\> drop today \(STILL NOT SQUOZZON\)](https://preview.redd.it/95rc080p3am61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=67e5ac3b2210f1fa48e4a58a4297793ea0b435c6)

As you can see GME reached a price of around 340$ per share today and it was just starting the lift off.

The super smart monkeyfellas maybe already noticed (so probably nobody cause nobody is reading this anymore)

In January it took them about 80 minutes to dumb the price to 152$... (I am just rounding here cause you get the idea even without the exact numbers)

[Totally legit free market chart #1](https://preview.redd.it/r3aof66q3am61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=165aba2a4936c5cb95cbc581dcb86b0850bfacbc)

This is how it looked today... It took them only 30 minutes to dumb the price back to 219$ per share (I guess it even dipped to 170$ right?).

[Totally legit free market chart #2](https://preview.redd.it/5sqw42gr3am61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5778b689a9b70a610791d86580a3ae84f5ca2e3)

So that is already pretty sus ... but not yet finished - lemme get a new banana for the next part:

After this huge dip the price stabilized - on both scenarios:

On the first ""peak"" in January it looked like that:

[Moving back up - Ending at 224$ per share](https://preview.redd.it/irttpwhs3am61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=78dd15120bf0b502e2fd0e5ea7bdb3d4dd228615)

Today it looked like that:

[Moving back up - Ending at 265$ per share](https://preview.redd.it/23svayjt3am61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc24225fdc141f8bb0d4c8ac5715575d443fc451)

So it seems like this total madness already happened to us on January 28th. Somehow I totally deleted this painful experience from my brain - probably some retarded diamond hands copeing mechanism ... They did it once and we returned back!

Sadly this story doesn't end well as many of you apes might know - the stock kept diving into the ground. Probably there were other circumstances with Vlad scking the hedgies dcks and stuff .. but as a retarded ape who has 35 shares @ 118

[proof](https://preview.redd.it/w3wfs8ru3am61.png?width=1411&format=png&auto=webp&s=20462650a24dba6d6341676370729b645ad56f4b)

I am kinda pissed. I really hope that this time the whole thing will turn around and don't get dumbed like last time. Cause if this isn't market manipulation at its best then I dont know.

**TLDR: STAND TOGETHER AS APES!! DON'T READ WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BIAS!**

This is definitely no financial advice - I don't even listen to myself so I definetly wouldn't listen to me when I were you- Just some crayon DD on my beloved GME Stocks

2021-02-22 07:37:41,Today is the day to do your job with PLTR,"I’ve been on this thread nonstop lately, advocating (don’t sue me ;)) y’all to get into this bad boy. The fundamentals are all there: a cutting edge tech unicorn with robust sales, earnings on deck, and unparalleled potential.

The ownership from institutions is otw as well. We all know Cathie Wood has tripled down in the last week, and recently, big banks like JP Morgan are confirming previous stakes in PLTR.

This is FB/GOOG in the waiting, but I believe it will soar like Tesla. Indeed, the monetary policy conditions right now are extremely conducive to mega cap tech companies getting grounded EXTREMELY FAST, see this provoking WSJ graphic on the topic 

(https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-tesla-made-it-to-the-winners-circle-11613739634?st=pkrws73wwocvyo8&reflink=article_imessage_share)

I think PLTR’s days in the $20 range are numbered. One can hem about valuations all day, but tell me why obsolete Snowflake is trading at 80X sales, and we can have an intelligent discussion.

If we (the market not WSB) believe Tesla, Snowflake, and Shopify are not a joke, than PLTR is grossly UNDERVALUED. I have to imagine smart money isn’t too far behind my thinking.",246,0.84

Too many fucked up valuations...huge debt increases that will affect future free cash flow, shareholder equity down inflating price to book ratios ($DAL at 20 now), Shiller PE getting out of whack, Total Market Cap to GDP record level, revenues not recovering for some time, SPAC frenzy.

2021-02-02 00:59:55,DDDD - Is GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold?,"This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or ""counterfeit"" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.

Much of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.

One thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**Methodology**

I'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.
2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.
3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.

**The Code**

    from collections import defaultdict
    import time
    import requests
    POLYGON_API_KEY = '<ADD YOUR API KEY HERE>'
    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY
    
    data
    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))
    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm
    for line in f:
        parts = line.split('|');
        date = parts[0]
        ticker = parts[2]
        try:
            fails = int(parts[3])
            price = float(parts[5])
            value_of_fails = price * fails
            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)
        except ValueError:
            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')
            pass
    
    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():
        day = int(date[-2:])
        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))
        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])
        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] > 10000000, sorted_stocks)
        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:
            val_of_fails = data[0]
            num_fails = data[1]
            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))
            res = req.json()
            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':
                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))
                continue
            else:
                try:
                    volume = res['volume']
                except KeyError:
                    print(res)
            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)
            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100
            print('{: <6} ${: <5} {: <9} / {: < 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))

Here's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.

If everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value > 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.

I'll let y'all discuss what this means in the comments. Have Fun.

EDIT - Someone pointed out a mistake in my script. Fixed, and added a bit more data

EDIT 2 - For those without enough brain wrinkles / attention span to interpret this - There may have been shady shit in the first few days of Jan, but doesn't look like anything went on in the second week. Will need to wait till Feb 15 to see data in the last few weeks of Jan. I'll probably do some more analysis when that time comes",265,0.93
2021-01-31 11:46:00,GME: The wrong side of the equity,"Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
Obligatory: I'm long a single share of GME, am not very smart, and you shouldn't take financial advice from anyone in this sub.
This is opinion only in nature and i aim only to discuss possibilities and their outcomes.

Tldr at bottom:

Okay, WSB is simply a very large pool of investors who are concerned for the capital of short sellers investors. We all individually decided that these HF's took on infinite risk vs reward and that its problematic and scary.

We have encouraged each other to hold our positions so that HF's lose money and stop taking on trades that can cause serious economic turmoil.

So here's the skinny: No one is margin calling these guys, and they aren't dying from the interest yet. They are holding.

But what if their capital left?
The questions needed to be answered are

1.) ""what HF's are actively short GME, AMC, ETC. ""

2.) Who do they manage funds for ( is it 100% millionaire entrepreneurs or is it teachers pensions, police pension funds and the like).

3.) Do THEIR investors understand that these HF's risked taking their investments to zero and actually bringing the HF into the negative?

4.) Can retail {legally} , an independent collective concerned for above mentioned pensions have a (or many) reputable securities lawyer reach out to Hf's clients and be sure they are aware of the immenent risks?

I'm going to guess that most people aren't aware that their investment fund is risking 100% of their money going out the window. Probably think its all in goog, aapl, and fb. 

It's not retail investors fault that they took on infinite risk and things didn't go their way. But retail may be able to burn the shorts and not the pensions managed by them all at the same time.

Poke holes in my theory, brain is smooth like a bowling ball, small computations only.

Edit: to those calling me a bot, or saying im doing HF's bidding. This isn't a sob story narrative, no one should feel bad about pensions as collateral damage except the Hf's who took on infinite risk. The only interest in who's assets under management they have is to tell them their investment with HF might blow up and maybe they take their capital out, choking HF's solvency out. 

Tldr: could wsb retain a securities lawyer (s) to help HF investors / e.g. pension managers understand the true risks of their GME, AMC etc short positions. Possibly rug pulling short sellers capital for a checkmate. Excluding any lock up periods",63,0.66

Hello again, GME Gang. What a fun day we had yesterday! Could it continue today? Only Melvin Capital (and maybe Ryan Cohen) knows!

And an extra special hello today to our newest WSB lookie-loo, Mr. Cramer (Can I call you Jim? I’m gonna call you Jim).  

Now Jim, from what I’ve been able to gather, you and your Boomer stocks and your Hot Manic Takes don’t always get a lot of love around here. But that’s not *all* your fault, Jim. The Paste-Eating Rocket Kids are often good for a solid meme (FYI: it’s pronounced “Mee-Mee.” Feel free to use that on air without verifying). But the Rocket Kids can be a dense bunch and they’re also often one click away from Total Financial Ruin (Quick shout out to SPCE: Pleas fly again). So you have to dig a bit in here to separate the wheat from the chaff, as someone like you actually says in real life. What the fuck even is chaff, Jim? And why do all Boomers seem to think that folksy farm-based idioms are the perfect way to conclude a thought?

Anyway. Those of us who watched your teevee clips last week where you reference your interest in WSB know that you, Jim Cramer, might be one of the Olds, but that you also Think Young(TM). [https://www.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/stock-market-advice-moderna-boeing-fed-ftc-dec-15](https://www.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/stock-market-advice-moderna-boeing-fed-ftc-dec-15). So we’re going to do our best to help your young-thinkin’ brain find the Needle In the Haystack here so you can get All Your Ducks In a Row on GME.  Because we know that you’re a long way from being Put Out to Pasture, and though you may be an out-of-touch millionaire prone to facile yammering, we now ***like*** you here, Jim—simply because you mentioned us and that made us blush a bit since we’re needy Millennials who just want our Boomer mommies and daddies to Tell Us They’re Proud of Us. So even though the Paste-Eating Rocket Kids here are often Buying A Pig in a Poke (Christ, please do not *ever* say that or the kids’ Mee-Mees are gonna fuck you up), we appreciate you recognizing that, every now and then, there’s something worth paying attention to over in this weird little pocket of the Interwebs.  And since you’re actually telling your loyal single-finger-typin’ viewers to check out this WSB shitshow, and “*if they’re running GME, then do some work on GME*,” we assume you might actually be checking this shit out too, since all true Young Thinkers know that What’s Good for the Goose is Good for the Gander. 

Now, is the GME play as solid as your recent recommendation to buy Bed Bath and Beyond? Who knows? That seems pretty stupid, and I would look it up myself this weekend but my nice little Saturday is already pretty full so I don’t know—I don’t know if I’ll have enough time. But I’ll tell you one thing: the GME play is **a lot more fucking fun**.  Life in a pandemic is boring, but here in this weird WSB place, these kids like fun.  And for all your Boomer weirdness, you seem like you still like to have a little fun in this Mad, Mad world of ours. So consider joining us here more often.  A word of warning, though: if you don’t like all the dern cuss words we use around here, Jim, well that’s just, like, your opinion man, and we’ll have you know that the Supreme Court has roundly rejected Prior Restraint. 

First thing’s first: we have a bit of a bone to pick with you (now there *I* go). The stuff you said last week about GME as the next Blockbuster was D-U-M dumb, Jim. You were a bit out of your fucking element with that.  You even made our largest shareholder and conqueror-in-waiting, Mr. Ryan Cohen, send an emoji-only tweet in response, which if you know the super nice-guy Ryan Cohen like all of us do (we actually know nothing), that is pretty much the equivalent of him bringing his dog over to micturate on your and George Sherman’s rug.

Now, I myself have never been into the whole brevity thing, but I wanted to take this opportunity to get you up to speed on the GME movie you’ve wandered into. And I know you’re down with this because you told all your viewers that if WSB is talking about GME, then “make sure you know GME.” So before you say something Absolutely Mad again and Cohen sends a tweet with an even less ambiguous emoji, it’s high time that you start Making the Sure here, Jim. Just consider this to be CPT Hubbard delivering you some Orange Sunshine and turning you on to some of that Sweet, Delicious Non-Chaff Wheat you love so goddamn much. 

**Part 1: GME’s Bonkers-Ass Short Interest**

Now, I’m going to lead with the most crowd-pleasing part of the story here (Get ready, Rocket Kids!), and it’s the one that you did not even seem remotely familiar with in your “Stay out of GameStop, Deadbeat!” rant last week. Maybe that was by design or maybe not. We’ll return to that, Jim. But the point here is: the **short interest here is batshit insane**. And not just your garden variety Boomer in Rolled Up Sleeves Ranting About Buying Estee Lauder While Hitting Buttons On The Beep-Bop-Boop Machine kind of insanity. Really and truly fucking nuts.

So to TL/DR this shit for you, Jim (to use the parlance of our times): GME is **the** **most shorted stock** **trading today—by far**.   [https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today) How shorted? Well, the value of shares short exceeds the market cap of the company; there are currently ***more shares short than the total number of shares outstanding***. And when factoring in the institutional and insider ownership, the total short percentage of float is **nearly 300%**. [https://www.gurufocus.com/term/FloatPercentageOfTSO/GME/Float-Percentage-Of-Total-Shares-Outstanding/GameStop-Corp](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/FloatPercentageOfTSO/GME/Float-Percentage-Of-Total-Shares-Outstanding/GameStop-Corp) Even higher, actually, now that Cohen’s interest is over 10%.  Now, I’m not a numbers whiz like you, but that level of short interest and the small available float seems pretty fucked up to me. Like: “how is that even legal?” fucked up. And just for a frame of reference, the **third most shorted** security right now is your beloved Bed Bath and Beyond, with a short percentage of float at a nice and tidy 69%. 

Are you starting to gather why some of us in this weird little pocket of the Interwebs are a little excited about GME? You see, as u/Jeffamazon and RodAlzmann u/Uberkikz11 and others have explained in these here corners and on the twitter machine with their top-notch DD, and as I will translate to you in lingo you can dig, the short sellers got way over their skiis on this one expecting a bankruptcy in Spring of 2020 that never came. And yet, amazingly, the short interest has only **increased** since then—there has effectively been no covering in the aggregate and, in fact, the short percentage has only **gone up**. And now, on the threshold of 2021, we all sit atop a massive powder keg wondering what is going to be the thing that finally lights this shit up. And at the end of this little missive, I’m going to tell you what I think that thing might be (Spoiler: It’s Ryan Cohen! Better start getting used to seeing his name, Jim, because this dude does not fuck around and he’s not going anywhere).

**Part 2****: GameStop Isn’t Going Bankrupt and People Actually Want to Buy Shit There**

So, you foul mouthed little prick, a bonkers-ass short interest is neat and all, but why is Jim Cramer wrong when Jim Cramer compares GME to Blockbuster you might be asking yourself in the third person. First, the most obvious answer, Jim, which you should fucking know already: Blockbuster was **nearly $1 Billion in debt** and missing debt payments left and right when it was delisted way back in 2010. That was also when there was a bit of a credit crunch, if you recall, right after that whole Housing Crash Unpleasantness that you saw coming from a mile away and from which you made hundreds of millions of dollars due to your contrarian foresight—I’m sorry, I’m clearly confusing you with Christian Bale starring as Dr. Michael Burry, weirdo head of Scion Asset Management, which also holds about 1.4M shares of GME (You really gotta start looking into this stuff, Jim. This story is made for TV, man—and you Boomers were raised by TV and you turned out TV!). Also, in 2010 when Netflix is ripping and when Blockbuster was about to be delisted and bankrupt, an analyst noted the obvious fact that Blockbuster  had “nothing on the horizon that makes it look like Blockbuster is going to be more profitable.” 

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blockbuster/blockbuster-wins-debt-reprieve-forced-to-delist-idUSTRE66052720100702](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blockbuster/blockbuster-wins-debt-reprieve-forced-to-delist-idUSTRE66052720100702) 

But Jim, if your Blockbuster comparison has any plausibility, GameStop must have a major debt problem then, right? And yet just last month GameStop **repaid $125M in debt** several months ahead of time. It’s also really weird that over the past year management bought back a ton of shares, taking the OS from 102M **down to just under 70M** (making a short squeeze even more likely, my Rocket Children). The weirdness continues with a soon-to-be-bankrupt company holding almost $500M in cash on hand. And according to George Sherman’s “Thine Omnichannel Shalt Be The Omni-est Channel of Them All” Conference Call following Q3, by March 2021 GME will have retired a total of $500M in debt and returned $200M to shareholders through stock buy backs. I’m no expert here, and I do not presently own a Beep-Bop-Boop Machine, but that’s all pretty weird shit to be doing if you’re about to go bankrupt.

No, no – I get it: who the fuck actually looks at balance sheets anyway before spouting off about what a stock is going to do? I sure as hell don’t. That’s why I follow my man u/Uberkikz11, since that dude is a GME DD Encyclopedia and was born to crunch numbers. No, when Really Smart People make the Blockbuster comparison, it’s usually just Mouth Sounds for: A B&M Store That Used to Be Popular But Now Is Not Because Technology, QED. But here even the Really Smart People might be missing something as well. They’re right in the sense that GME must use this new console cycle window and cash influx to quickly pivot to a tech-first gaming company (more on that and our boy RC shortly!), but they’re wrong on the timing and relevance of this Super Smart Insight.

So fine, they’re doing ok on debt and cash. But who even goes to that 90s-Ass-Looking Cluttered Mall Geekery anymore anyways? I confess: in my darkest moments, as the short sellers manipulate the fuck out of this stock and I curse the names Bell and Sherman, I too have wondered this. But it turns out that, just like I have no idea why anyone listens to Maroon 5 or eats at Applebee’s, apparently a lot of people in America do shit that I do not. Crazy huh? So here is some pretty neat data showing us how out of touch we might be here, Jim: 

First, when a pretty large sample size of people were recently asked the question: *which of the following stores or websites do you plan to buy holiday gifts from*? The **#5 response** from United States Americans was none other than **GameStop** (Ticker, Jim: GME). Only Walmart, Amazon, Target, and Dollar Store (poor people buy gifts too, Jim) were ahead of little old GameStop. That’s higher than Nike, Macy’s, the Apple Store—and **double** the response of Bed Bath and Fucking Beyond in every category they surveyed. Check it: (h/t to my man u/snowk88) 

[https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/260983915](https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/260983915)

That’s kinda crazy huh? See Jim, when you Think Young(TM), you really can learn something new every day. And by following our man u/snowk88 (@snowk88 over at stocktwits), I learn lots of cool shit. But guess who already knew that? The guy that wrote this bad-ass letter that identifies GME’s brand and customer data as being one of the most valuable things GME has going for it. [https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC\_Ventures\_Letter\_to\_GameStop.pdf](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf) 

So now we know that Real Life People actually buy shit at GameStop here in the year of our lord 2020. But like that analyst from 2010 said about Blockbuster, there must not be anything on the horizon for GameStop to be more profitable in 2021, right?

Now, I will admit that being a bit bearish on GME in December of 2020 would make more sense if, say, GameStop were the nation’s largest purveyor of limp and half-lit pumpkin spice-scented candles and we were exiting the apogee of Shitty Candle Season. But as it turns out, GameStop is currently selling basically the most sought-after items that exist in the marketplace right now—where demand for the Xbox and Ps5 is far outpacing supply and is projected to continue well into 2021.  [https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-11-17-microsoft-expects-xbox-series-x-s-shortages-until-q2-2021](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-11-17-microsoft-expects-xbox-series-x-s-shortages-until-q2-2021) I don’t really need to get into the details on that here, because it’s pretty goddamn obvious, but I think 2020 GameStop at the precipice of a new console cycle might be in a bit of a better position than, say, 2010 Blockbuster relying on the latest Adam Sandler release to lift its sagging rental numbers. But I don’t know. Millions of people don’t watch *my* show looking for Candid Analysis from me and *my* folksy man-of-the-people-lookin’ rolled-up sleeves.

**Part 3:** **Ryan Cohen is the Sword of Damocles Hanging Over the Short Sellers’ Dumbass Heads** 

And now we’ve gotten to the best part. It’s my favorite part of all of this, Jim, and if you give this a little time, I think it will be yours too. You see, all that corporate bla bla bla about balance sheets and console cycles and early debt repayment and overleveraged short sellers and brand recognition is neat and all—and definitely worth a second look by itself. Maybe even a little Beep-Bop-Boop on the ol’ sound machine—I don’t know your methods. But the real thing that’s about to rip all our faces off here is the business and investment decisions of a mild-mannered wunderkind named Ryan Cohen.

Now you can revisit my prior epistle if you want to know a bit more about the involvement of Mr. Ryan Cohen in *Le Affair* *GameStop*. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kakxrm/gme\_tribe\_a\_story\_about\_how\_ryan\_cohen\_is\_about/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kakxrm/gme_tribe_a_story_about_how_ryan_cohen_is_about/).  My fly-by-night theory of his lawyer’s possible use of the consent solicitation could have probably marinated for another day, but the thrust of my argument there was that Cohen and his attorney have been laying the groundwork to come after GameStop for a while now. And that Cohen was likely emboldened by the humiliating, lame-ass CC performance by some dude with a mid-century comic-strip sounding name that we’ll all soon know only as: The Guy With the Punchable Face Who Used to Be CEO of GameStop.

But here is where things get really interesting. This is a story in the making, Jim, for fucks sake - take notes! This Monday, on December 21, Mr. Ryan Cohen filed a revised 13D showing that last week he started buying a shit-ton of shares—starting on Tuesday December 15th—which is ***the day after*** the stock price inexplicably plunged on Monday the 14th and the very same day you were yammering on the teevee about GME being Blockbuster! Instead of listening to you, however, Cohen started buying more GME shares (super-sleuth dark pool watchers u/rgrAi and u/snowk88 noticed in real-time that there was some very large accumulation taking place), which culminated in the big reveal that Cohen purchased a total of 2,501,000 additional shares last week—500,000 of which were purchased on Friday December 18, 2020 **at the price of $16.02 a share**. Ryan Cohen is still the single largest shareholder of GME with 9,001,000 shares in total, taking his ownership of GME above the 10% threshold from 9.98% to 12.9%. And so he apparently thinks that the floor for his investment is $16.02 per share. Is he still buying? We’ll know soon. But yesterday seemed like a little taste of what it might look like if a large buyer steps in to prevent short sellers from manipulating all of my nervous little Rocket Children here and their delicate little paper hands.

There was another thing we learned from this 13D filing: Ryan Cohen has apparently hired a new attorney and law firm. Instead of the great Christopher Davis of Kline Kaplan, now Ryan Cohen is represented by Ryan P. Nebel, a partner with Olshan Frome Wolosky, LLP.  Now, if you’re familiar with my prior ramblings, you might wonder if I was a bit confused, and maybe even a little sad, at this sudden change from my man C. Davis. And you might be a little right. But then the wonder of the internet allowed me to learn a bit about these new lawyers. And holy shit, things are about to get fun.

Now, I liked what I knew about Chris Davis and he seems like a genuine bad ass activist attorney. But the folks at Olshan Frome and Wolosky, LLP are Next Level Players and really seem tailor-made for this exact situation. First off, Olshan is ranked as **the top global lawfirm** for Activist Attorneys. [https://www.olshanlaw.com/assets/htmldocuments/Bloomberg%20Activism%20League%20Tables%20H12020.pdf](https://www.olshanlaw.com/assets/htmldocuments/Bloomberg%20Activism%20League%20Tables%20H12020.pdf) (H/t @flummoxed at stocktwits). They seem to be the go-to law firm for major proxy battles initiated by activist investors. But possibly even more important is that Olshan is the ***same firm that represented Hestia and Permit*** in their successful proxy battle earlier this year to appoint two new directors to the GME Board.  I’m not going into the fine details of that, because this is already a bit of a long-form Idiot’s New Yorker article, but GameStop just went through a proxy fight last year with Activist Investors Hestia Capital and Permit Capital, which resulted in two Board seats for our shareholder buds from Hestia and Permit. So, it’s reasonable to assume that the attorneys at Olshan might know their way around GameStop at this point and where the pressure points are here. 

[http://www.globallegalchronicle.com/hestia-capital-and-permit-capitals-two-new-directors-to-the-gamestop-board/](http://www.globallegalchronicle.com/hestia-capital-and-permit-capitals-two-new-directors-to-the-gamestop-board/)

And if you follow u/snowk88 over at stocktwits (@snowk88)— you’d also find a wealth of DD on how Olshan rolls when entering these activist-investor-replaces-dumbass-boards-and-CEOs type disputes. To bottom line it: **they get it fucking done**. 

[https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/266158534](https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/266158534)

But what else did we learn from the 13D? We learned that Ryan Cohen is definitely not going anywhere any time soon. Specifically, the filing notes that RC Ventures intends to continue to engage in discussions with GameStop’s board *“regarding means to drive stockholder value, including through changes to the composition of the board and other corporate governance enhancements.""* And while RC Ventures *“desires to come to an amicable resolution with \[GameStop, it\] will not hesitate to take any actions that it believes are necessary to protect the best interests of all stockholders.”*

I really like that last part, don’t you? And although I thought his November 16th letter was pretty goddamn clear, this 13D just ratcheted up the transparency level here. In sum, Ryan Cohen has all of our backs and he’s going to replace this Board and Sherman with people that are on the level and that will help implement his vision.

And now seems like a good time to return to those “Ryan Cohen: Boy Genius” articles that were definitely NOT part of a well-coordinated pre-hostile takeover media campaign initiated earlier this year. I think there might be a few things in those articles that Mr. Cohen wanted all of us shareholders (as well as the short sellers and the Board he’s about to replace) to really and truly understand.  Recall also that Cohen is not one for diversification or for playing it safe. So here’s a few choice nuggets for you to ponder:

\*\*\*

Bloomberg, June 2020: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/chewy-founder-cashes-out-bets-on-apple-wells-fargo](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/chewy-founder-cashes-out-bets-on-apple-wells-fargo)

· ""It's too hard to find, at least for me, what I consider great ideas,"" he says. ""When I find things I have a lot of conviction in, I go all-in."" 

· Cohen uses the word “conviction” a lot. He says it’s something he learned from his father, who ran a glassware importing business in Montreal where Cohen grew up. “He taught me how to block the noise from the masses,” says Cohen. “To have a point of view and have conviction and not waver.”

· He wouldn’t, however, recommend his \[non-diversified\] investment approach to everyone. “You need to have the temperament to block the noise,” he says. “Sometimes it feels like a roller coaster.”

· He likens his obsessive focus on building Chewy to his approach to stock picking. ""I don't want to swing for a single,"" he says.

\*\*\*

You hear that, Jim? Our man Cohen likes idioms too! But fuck those farm idioms, Jim – we’re upgrading to the Sportsball kind now.  So what’s the takeaway here? I’d say that Cohen has his Eye On The Ball and that it’s time for all short sellers and the Board to Throw in The Towel because Ryan Goddamn Cohen likes to Take the Bull By The Horns and will ensure that he Hits a Homerun for shareholders that believe in his vision.

Here’s a few more things Mr. Cohen wants all of us to know:

\*\*\*

Forbes, August 2020: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=41e1370e5840](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=41e1370e5840)

· “For me, each no sounded like they just didn’t understand my vision. It was frustrating at times, but never discouraging. Those ‘no’s never made me doubt my strategy – it was the opposite. I was motivated by all the rejections and they just got me fired up.”

· “I understood that thinking big was likely going to be misunderstood along the way. I’m contrarian by nature, so being misunderstood often validates what I’m doing. It wasn’t until Chewy boxes were on doorsteps across the country that the bulk of investors started to recognize our formula.”

· “\[M\]y biggest risk would have been not taking risk. The risk of going head-to-head against Amazon. The risk of insourcing fulfillment. The risk of building a company in Florida rather than a popular tech hub. The risk of spending $3 million a month on TV ads, more than Home Depot HD -0.1%'s budget. The risk of hiring expensive executives even though we weren’t profitable. These decisions were some of the most controversial and required me being comfortable betting against conventional wisdom, and were often contrary to the advice of my board. Suffice it to say, I was not the most popular board member.”

· “Dad never swayed when he believed in something. I never compromised my vision, regardless how many investors turned me down I was not going to give up on building Chewy into the world’s biggest online pet retailer. I love to be challenged, and I’m flexible on details, but I’m never willing to give up.”

\*\*\*

Goddamn it, Ryan. I was done having children but now you’ve forced me into getting back on that train just so I can name this future child Ryan Fucking Cohen. Thanks a lot, asshole.

But to return to my point: are those the statements of a man that seems likely to walk away at this point? Or is Cohen trying to tell us all to get ready because he is going **All In** on this shit?

So where does this leave us? After a huge week where Cohen buys 2.5M more shares and then the SP skyrockets to $20 yesterday on that news? Well, this is where I want to tip my cap to my man Justin Dopierala over at Seeking Alpha and allow him to conclude this section. He, along with his pal Dmitriy Kozin have been pretty clear-eyed on all this shit for a while now and they both deserve some credit. And I know I gave my main man Justin a bit of a hard time in my last novella, but the dude is sharp as hell and helped a lot of us see the forest through the trees here.  And you should also definitely invite him to join your poker nights (seriously: check out the dude’s tweet in response to our own Rod Alzmann’s introduction of the #WeWantCohen hashtag right after the Q3 call debacle). [https://twitter.com/DOMOCAPITAL/status/1336446055685230592](https://twitter.com/DOMOCAPITAL/status/1336446055685230592).  You have no comment on a potential takeover involving Ryan Cohen, Justin after your hour-long googly-eyed call together? Can’t believe you’re just preemptively leaving the WSJ and Bloomberg hanging like that. Justin, I love you dude, but if I’m holding pocket Kings I’m folding after that tweet because that twinkle in your eye lets me know you’re about to drop two Aces on my ass.

Anyway. Here is what our man Dopierala thinks might happen here soon (and he called this way back on November 17th- and sorry - no links here, per the mods, as apparently no Alpha must ever be Sought from these parts):

*I think a very likely outcome at this point is a majority slate next shareholder meeting where Cohen takes over BOD and then makes himself CEO. A majority slate proxy battle would require all institutions to call in shares and would force a squeeze.*

We’re intrigued, Justin. Please continue:

*If Ryan Cohen successfully negotiates a purchase price with the Board then the shareholders will have to vote on it. Unlike the proxy battle where Hestia and Permit were running a minority slate of directors, an offer to purchase GameStop would force institutions like Vanguard and Blackrock to call in their shares. By doing so, the shorts would be forced to close out their positions and GameStop would finally have the greatest short squeeze of all-time. Ironically, Cohen could use this opportunity to sell all of his shares and use the proceeds to entirely fund the acquisition of GameStop going down as the first person in history to acquire a billion dollar company... for absolutely nothing. In fact, his acquisition price would be less than zero.*

And now is when I get to speculate on what I think is going to happen here. But I do not necessarily think Cohen is going to put an offer to buy GME to take private. That would definitely trigger a MOASS, but I’m not sure I see it given the attorneys he’s hired and his recent buys up to $16 and the amount of cash that would take. Like Dopierala’s *first* comment, though, I think Cohen is going to nominate directors to replace nearly the entire Board of Directors with a vote happening at the annual meeting and once that Board is in place, they’ll appoint Cohen as CEO. And as Justin notes, if he nominates a majority slate of directors, shares will have to be called in to vote. And this vote and proxy battle will make the prior minority slate Hesita/Permit battle, and the tiny short squeeze that took place when that happened, look tame by comparison.

Now everyone: get your calendars out. Because the date to nominate directors here is in **Mid-March**, and my super-smart corporate lawyer buds inform me that it’s standard practice to file about 7-10 days prior. So, if this actually happening, we should be seeing something on this by **early March**.

But even though early March is now the mark on the wall, today’s insane price action caused me to think about all of this a bit harder and speculate a bit more. And a major h/t to my buds on the stocktwits board, especially u/rgrAi (@amarbar) for all the sharp analysis on this. But if you were Ryan Cohen and you knew this company was hugely undervalued and you had a high level of **CONVICTION** here and also knew you needed shareholder votes to sweep out these dumbasses and implement your vision—then how would you play this with the short interest here as crazy as it is? I’d keep buying. Why? Well, lots of reasons, you smart alecks. 

First, so I have more guaranteed votes (duh?). Second, so that when the building starts burning and short hedge funds run for the exits they find that a mild-mannered Millennial with super-good ideas has sealed off all the doors and windows. That’s gruesomely delicious, isn’t it? Why else, CPT? Well, finally, and maybe most importantly, because I would want to excite and delight all my fellow shareholders by triggering a slow-burn short squeeze, raising the SP significantly, so that I can once again make the point (as he did in the Nov 16 letter) that the incompetent management that caused a **HUGE drop in SP** following that utterly incompetent Q3 call and the shelf registration, had **nothing to do with the SP increase** that again happened once Cohen announced his intent and started buying. Not the console cycle, not the cost containment measures, not the buybacks and not the early debt reduction. Nope: rightly or wrongly, shareholders will see Ryan Cohen buying shares and the corresponding SP increase and everyone—especially all new buyers who are delighted at their good fortune and swept up by Ryan Cohen Fever 2021—will start getting #WeWantCohen tattoos on their ass they’ll be so happy. And all of us, newly enriched by Ryan Cohen’s Big Canadian Balls and tactical brilliance, will crawl over glass to vote for him over The Boomer Artist Formally Known As GameStop’s CEO. I could be very wrong on this last point in particular, but if we start seeing 13Ds drop here shortly, things should get very fun very quickly. 

**Part 4: A Return to Our Short-Squeeze-to-Da-Moon Discussion: Who’s Side Are You Fucking On, Jim?**

Now, Jim, given the fast friendship we’re creating here, and all we’ve been through over the past 5000 words, I hesitate in bringing this up. But we’ve all seen the video, Jim. You know the one I’m talking about. Yes, the one where you actually tell the truth about how short selling hedge funds manipulate the market to knock down the price of perfectly good securities that many hard-working people *invest in*—many normal-ass people all assuming they wont ever have to Point Where On The Dolly The Invisible Hand of the Economy Touched Them. But that’s not life now is it Jim? And fuck those poor-ass rubes for not knowing how to play the game with you sophisticated Masters of the Universe, *amirite*?

[https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/93evx4/jim\_cramer\_reveals\_dirty\_tricks\_short\_sellers\_use/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/93evx4/jim_cramer_reveals_dirty_tricks_short_sellers_use/)

[https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/cramer-market-manipulator/](https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/cramer-market-manipulator/)

So where are **you** in this whole GME/Cohen story, Jim? You candidly (gleefully?) acknowledge that a prime strategy that shorts deploy is to spread negative rumors that are then amplified by Big Smart Trustworthy Financial Media Titans like yourself to shake out unsophisticated retail players like my Rocket Kids here—who because of their tiny paper hands and you mean short selling brutes often subsist on paste and paste alone. 

So for this particular security, are you the one helping with the manipulation and actively creating the “new truth” or are you just one of the Useful Idiots that these short sellers use to manipulate with an anodyne, TV media-ready comparison like: *GameStop Is The Next Blockbuster*? And how in the fuck does this fit into your Think Young(TM) project, Jim? Because if there is one thing that we over at WSB fucking hate, it’s a bunch of Manipulative Short Selling Boomer Fuckwads. Why on earth would a hip Young Thinker like you want to be included in that crew, Jim?

And I know we’re all friends here now, Jim, but I need to push back a bit on some of what you said in that video in such a cavalier whatareyagonnado manner. So if I understand you, short and distort and fomenting negative reactions from retail players based on deliberately false narratives is ***illegal***, but still easy as fuck to do ""because the SEC doesn't understand it."" But you fucking do understand it, Jim! So why are you helping those short and distorters break the law here? Why are you being such an obtuse dumbshit? Just check out what happens to the borrow rate and short selling every time there is any good news for GME: 

[https://stocktwits.com/Slantedangles/message/264519950](https://stocktwits.com/Slantedangles/message/264519950) (h/t @slantedangles). This manipulation isn't just happening with GME; it is happening *everywhere*. It’s baked into the cake. And that is pretty fucked up that we all just accept it because *whatareyagonnado*.

I think that one thing that those of us who truly do Think Young(TM) have a hard time understanding is at what point in your lives do you Boomers all finally come to realize that it’s maybe time to stop playing the game like you have been? What point do you finally have enough where doing the right thing matters more than getting paid? Maybe start by telling the truth more often—and maybe don’t go out of your way to help those corrupt-ass hedge fund managers who continually fuck over average people *merely because they were stupid enough to believe you all*. What contempt you Masters of the Universe have for all of them—for all of *us*. There is a bigger story here on GME and this out-of-control short interest (naked shorting, counterfeit shares)   [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) than even Ryan Cohen and the inevitable short squeeze we’re about to witness here. And it begins and ends with people like you and Melvin Capital and Bank of America not giving a fuck about the rules while thinking you’re smarter than the rest of us who do—but who lack power to do anything about it. And you know what? Maybe you *are* smarter than us. You certainly know how to play this game pretty well, as that video shows. But if I know my old school 1980s movies like I think I do, this is usually the part of the story where the rag-tag kids from across the tracks come over to show you hubristic rich fuckheads what happens when you fuck a stranger in the ass. 

Now I myself have never dabbled in pacifism, Jim, so this isn’t too much of a stretch for me, but seeing that video of yours and seeing the insane short interest and all the manipulation here makes me want to burn the whole corrupt system to the ground—while barricading the doors to trap in those arrogant-ass short sellers who lie and cheat and distort to profit off average people. And though I’m certain that this larger battle is not driving him, maybe that result is one that Ryan Cohen wouldn’t mind too. Though he’s a polite Canadian and would probably just let everyone know that he’s not really mad, just disappointed. But me?  I’m an Angry American and I say: Block the fucking doors and windows and light that shit up. 

So maybe this epistle will be useful for your Think Young(TM) project and cause you to reflect a bit more on what’s really going on out there with this whole GME thing and the likely illegal shorting that has driven the short percentage of float to these insane levels, drawing in new retail shorts too stupid to know what’s even happening.  Or maybe it wont cause you to reflect in the slightest (count me as one of those cynical types that see your overtures to WSB as a transparent play for greater market share from the Young Crowd since your old-ass audience is dying and/or switching to bonds).  But in a few months when all the Billy Ray Valentines and Louis Winthorpes assembled here are toasting each other in stupid shirts on a white-sand beach somewhere, we do not want you to look back on your knee-jerk boomer-ass dismissal of GME and your Useful Idiot blathering with that same tinge of regret and longing you feel when you look at a pre-Client 9 picture of you and your old roomie: warm-toes-and-hosiery-enthusiast E. Spitzer, Esq.

In conclusion: GME = Blockbuster comparisons are for Simps and Corrupt Short-and-Distorters. Don’t be like them, Jim.  And to my Rocket Children: the only weapon we wield in this stupid game is Diamond Hands with a float like this. Toughen the fuck up.

And Happy Holidays everyone.

\--CPT Hubbard

**TL/DR**: Jim Cramer likes farm-based idioms and apparently being a useful idiot to scummy short selling hedge funds. DD on the GME turnaround is solid and overleveraged short sellers should be shitting themselves. Ryan Cohen, our polite, hard-working Canadian benefactor is about to rip all our fucking faces off and trigger a MOASS. Probably even by early March, if that time is good for you (he’ll text before he comes).  And fuck infinite regress: It’s rockets all the way down here.  **🚀🚀🚀** Now: diamond hands, motherfuckers.

If that’s not your jam, please enjoy this cartoon of Alex Karp crushing the competition, then scroll down to the bottom of the DD where you’ll find my plan for the end of my lockup plus a few diamond emojiis, a couple of hand emojiis and a bunch of vacuum optimized transportation device emojiis.

[\(photo credit for the Karptoon goes to ex-Palantir designer u\/gottacroe and my wife u\/LindsayatAdaDiamonds photoshopping in the Salesforce Einstein\)](https://preview.redd.it/qo98za7m4ph61.jpg?width=2550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=795b2bc3b634a695bf173008625a2ab6a4eeccf6)

Lots of words below, so here’s the TL;DRs, Table of Contents, a self dox, and position disclosure before my DD.

**TL;DR #1**: After watching Demo Day twice, I am blown away at how much Palantir’s products have matured in the last 6 years since I left Palantir. I find the new UX far superior to offerings from GOOG, MSFT, and CRM. Apollo is absolutely incredible, and it’s going where no clouds have gone before… from Humvees to nuclear submarines. Lastly, it is clear to me that PLTR has invested heavily in best-of-class administrative tools to improve the speed to deploy Palantir. Bottom line: I fully understand why IBM gave up fighting Palantir and is now selling Palantir Foundry to IBM clients.

PLTR when I left in 2015 versus the Palantir I saw on Demo Day:

[You've come a long way baby.](https://preview.redd.it/opd8qiutdph61.jpg?width=1182&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b4bf46f2978e194792814abf31e84c3e19fa6632)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #2:** IBM just surrendered to PLTR. In the words of POTUS, this is a… 

# Big. 

# Fucking. 

# Deal. 

To put it politely, IBM and Palantir don’t have a very good past relationship. So the fact that IBM is now pushing Foundry means one thing: Foundry is so unfuckwithable that IBM was losing numerous contracts to Foundry-wielding competitors and IBM had no choice but to swallow their pride and cut a deal with Papa Karp.

* First they ignore you.
* Then they laugh at you.
* Then they fight you.
* Then they surrender to you and sign a deal to slang Foundry to thousands of clients in 180 countries.
* Then they send your shareholders tendies for decades.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #3:** Regardless of how ‘good’ or ‘bad’ the 2020 earnings are tomorrow, I find the news from early 2021 to be an incredibly strong signal pointing to an eventual $250B+ market cap for Palantir – BP renewing their enterprise deal, Rio Tinto and PG&E signing a new enterprise deals, AT&T aggressively hiring for Palantir skills, and 2,500 IBMers now pushing Foundry to clients all over the world, etc. IE the tea leaves I'm reading point to strong growth in 2021 and beyond.

It's also worth mentioning that many of the new commercial clients have some of the most difficult and complex supply chains in the world.

If they’re in, I’m in.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #4**: Eventually, institutional traders will comprehend the immense long-term value of ~~Planeteer~~ ~~Planter~~ Palantir and the stock will join the PFAANG club (though I vote that we rename it the FAAPNG club).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Because there are so many shills, pumpers, and bullshiters on WSB these days, I’ll self dox myself. I’m Jason Payne. I joined Palantir in early 2007, when it was a few dozen geeks with big dreams, and left in 2015 to become the CEO of [Ada Diamonds](https://www.adadiamonds.com/) (hence my username). 

I joined Reddit to do an official [AMA on laboratory-grown diamonds](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8pb8d5/i_grow_diamonds_i_make_custom_jewelry_with_these/) a few years ago that hit the front page, stuck around, and have absolutely fallen in love with the Reddit community. Thus, I want to give back to my fellow Redditors with a bunch of words and a few pictures to explain Palantir from the perspective of a former employee.

You may think that I’m a Palantir sock puppet given how my bullish I am in this DD. I’m not. Turns out I have a DD-writing fetish. Don’t kink shame. [Here’s a couple of my prior DDs](https://medium.com/@Jason_Payne) on De Beers, Tiffany & Co., and the FTC.  

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Positions or ban:** At the current PLTR share price, I hold a [Keyser Söze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5k73jx2mIc) position - I could sell out this week and simply walk off into the sunset. But I’m not going to. I have yet to sell all of my unlocked 20%, and I plan to mostly diamond hands my soon-to-be-unlocked 80%, with a decade long diversification plan to exit my concentrated stock position, regardless of earnings tomorrow. 

Why? I like the stock, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#1) Praise & Constructive Criticism for Demo Day**

Existentially, Demo Day was incredibly impressive. This thread with u/namingisreallyhard, u/DentalFox, and u/jamauer sums it up:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lpzxhuse5ph61.jpg?width=526&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e677cb560749bb8cbeeee1a64d4ac2a731ced48

Four things stood out to me:

**Superior Design Language to CRM, MSFT, and GOOG:** Palantir has a completely different front-end user experience (UX) than my time at Palantir, that I saw for the first time on Demo Day. I find it practical, beautiful, and efficient.

The design language is called Blueprint Javascript, and it’s built on React, a modern web development platform that Facebook built. Big ups to Palantir for open sourcing BlueprintJS, meaning that anyone can use it: [https://blueprintjs.com/](https://blueprintjs.com/)

Blueprint is a UI toolkit for web development of complex data-dense interfaces for desktop applications. Compared to the cartoonish UX of Salesforce’s Lightning, the flat UX of Google, and the rigid UX of Microsoft Office, I would much prefer to work in Blueprint all day.

I struggle with how spread out Lightning is by default and really appreciated how dense the Blueprint inerfaces are without feeling crowded. Getting that balance right is really difficult.

**Deep Investment in Deployability**: Administrative tools are the unloved stepchild of enterprise software. No-one buys the backend system, so minimal investments are typically made to build the backend tools to run the software. 

Salesforce still hasn’t ported their admin tools from their clunky Web 1.0 Salesforce Classic to their more modern Lightning design system. Google’s back end admin tools suck compared to their client facing tools - Gmail, Calendar, AdWords, etc.

The admin tools that Palantir demoed appeared far better than what I use every day to run my Salesforce instance. I bet I could do most tasks in Foundry 40-75% faster than Salesforce. 

**Migration from ‘*****Find the Terrorist*****’ to '*****Cheat Code for War*****':** When I was at Palantir, the primary use case for Gotham was link analysis to find the bad guy. Gotham has clearly evolved from that mission to a far broader set of missions. 

Another Redditor described Gotham as ‘cheat code for war,’ and I think that is spot on. That’s why Palantir has won so many different logistics, mission planning, command and control, etc. military contracts recently, including the Space Force 

**DoD IL-6 SaaS Approval:** Palantir moving to IL-6 approval could be an entire massive DD on its own, but I’ll keep it short. It’s a big fucking deal to get Apollo running on classified networks, and Palantir is far ahead of the other big SaaS players in this approval:

[Palantir is the IL-ist SaaS on the market](https://preview.redd.it/eo8dcuir5ph61.jpg?width=1314&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b2c02e0131256508c34eeb0c2cdaeb26bc2a2eb)

Now that I have fanboied on Demo Day I want to be critical of the presentation style of Demo Day. I’d give the presenters a C+ at best. I found it rushed, confusing, and difficult to follow. I had to watch it twice to fully absorb the content, and I’ve given 500+ Palantir demos in my lifetime! My constructive criticism:

* Slow down 15-20%
* Err on the side of a simpler, more approachable lexicon 
* For the love of God, stop reading from scripts. Use bullet points
* Handoffs were way to abrupt. Take a deep breath between presenters for us to get prepared for a new topic
* Get better microphones and Snowsound panels for future presentations
* Get a professional public speaking coach involved in rehearsals 

I’m not alone in my take on Demo Day. Here are a few unprompted DMs I got from random Redditors on the presentation:

>*· I don't know if it is just me, but I genuinely felt like I was watching a haphazard presentation that didn't really do justice nor capture attention in a lucrative way*  
>  
>*· It lacked charisma and charm, and it felt cobbled together like a group project by university students*  
>  
>*· I was watching the demo day presentation, and left feeling underwhelmed. It may have been impressive to someone who is in the industry, but from someone outside of it, it all sounded greek to me.*  
>  
>*· I felt like the Gotham team was clearly the A team and Foundry needs better presentation skills.*

I know my last PLTR DD made the rounds at Palantir, so here’s a direct message to those behind Demo Day - if everyone told you that you ‘*killed it*,’ you \*really\* need to find someone in the organization willing to speak truth to power.

\_\_\_\_\_

**#2) Why Palantir is a Diamond Fisted Iron Man Suit**

One of the Demo Day presenters made an interesting comment that stuck with me: At Palantir, we build Iron Man suits, not robots.

No, Palantir does not have a skunk works program building flying mech suits (AFAIK).

Palantir builds *cerebral* cyborgs, not *physical* cyborgs. Palantir’s products create a symbiotic relationship between human beings and computers to better solve *cerebral* tasks, not *physical* tasks.

&#x200B;

[Iron Man. Cerebral Edition.](https://preview.redd.it/krrhl2b18ph61.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9cd28bdbdab1e372fddb9a91002774fe44c0f900)

If you have not watched Demo Day yet (or you rewatch it), listen for how many times they say the words ‘decision’ and ‘decision makers.’

Why a **diamond fisted** Iron Man suit? Palantir just closed an enterprise deal with Rio Tinto, who is the 3rd largest diamond producer in the world. So Rio Tinto will be using their PLTR-powered Iron Man suits to dig for fistfuls of diamonds on multiple continents.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**#3) The True ROI of Palantir**

Palantir is really expensive. No question about it. 

But you know what’s more expensive than Palantir? Bad Decisions. Being wrong is really, really expensive. See the Airbus 380, Microsoft’s market share of cell phones, the Golden State Warriors drafting Todd Fuller over Kobe Bryant, shorting GME in early January, and BMW/Mercedes/Lexus’s dismissal of TSLA.

The true ROI of Palantir is substantially better decision making across your organization. Even a moderate improvement in decision making creates deep fucking value for an organization.

For example, Airbus claims that Foundry helped them improved the speed of A350 production by 33%. There are 5 million discrete parts in an A350, and the Foundry-powered decisions led to a 33% improvement in production. Palantir doesn’t make that claim. Airbus makes that claim. That’s absolutely bonkers and that’s why this is no surprise:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u5tuxd3v7ph61.jpg?width=675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a7e0dc34fc3b59e2e308b1e2440c7b6d28a02bc3

The BP renewal and the new deals (PG&E, Rio Tinto, Fiat, etc) prove u/petroduct is right. If you have complex logistics, you should have Foundry.

Say that Palantir improves the quality of decisions made at United Airlines by 6.9%. How much will the UAL stock appreciate over the next decade? If Palantir helps Rio Tinto improve decision making by 4.20%, how much will their bottom line grow by 2025?

Below are a few excerpts from United's Director of Technical Operations on how they use Foundry. This is just scratching the surface of how an airline can use Palantir to improve operations; however, if each of these models/decisions are incrementally improved, even a little bit, the value to United is fucking deep.

The entire blog post is a great read if you want to go deeper on Foundry: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/)

>*\[minor edits for brevity\]*  
>  
>*The return-to-service model recommends which specific aircraft to return at which time in the future and how to utilize our available maintenance capacity (internal & external) to ensure they’re airworthy when we need them. Since we don’t know when air travel demand will recover, the models need to account for slow recoveries, fast recoveries, and everything in between.*  
>  
>*Our optimization models consider when “big events” (airframe checks, engine overhauls, and landing gear overhauls) will be due, along with the cost of those events and the available maintenance capacity to complete them. The models also incorporate other factors: parts availability and cost, available technician hours at each maintenance station, ability to secure supplemental maintenance lines at external MRO providers, aircraft-specific mechanical reliability and on-time performance, and even the quality of the in-flight products (seats, Wi-Fi, entertainment, power outlets).*   
>  
>*The team is also helping optimize the cycling of active and parked aircraft whenever we have surplus planes available to fly, which ensures regulatory compliance with the maintenance program, minimizes operating costs, and enables our Tech Ops team to be very intentional about balancing our operational objectives – do we want to fly the most reliable aircraft, the lowest cost aircraft, or the aircraft with the most time left until its next major maintenance event?*

**#4) Muthafuckin’ Clouds in Nuclear Submarines**

Toward the end of the Apollo demo, one of the presenters offhandedly mentioned something that caused my jaw to hit the floor: Palantir will be deploying Apollo on US Navy submarines.

IL-6. Clouds. In. Nuclear. Submarines. 

As someone who has installed and managed Palantir servers in server rooms all over the world, I can’t state how huge it is that the US Navy is approving the Apollo modular cloud architecture to be deployed on some of their most sensitive and expensive assets. 

The fact that upgrades to the entire fleet can be managed like upgrading an AWS server? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nyytsh2t7ph61.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3add6e4cce72860f13b66048defdc0ba715c77ae

\_\_\_\_\_

**#5) Does it Matter that Palantir Needs FDEs at Deployments?**

One of the favorite arguments of the Palantir bears is that Palantir is an unscalable, overvalued services company that should have the same P/E as Accenture, Booz, BAE, etc. The bears say that Palantir only has a handful of clients and can’t scale. In my mind, the quality of the admin tools show on Demo Day and the IBM partnership announcement eviscerated that argument.

When I was at Palantir, it was a bitch to build and manage deployments. From what I saw on Demo Day, Palantir is now easier than Salesforce to deploy. I say that as someone who has written tens of thousands of lines of code for Salesforce (Lightning, Apex, SOQL and Visualforce). 

Eventually, Palantir will have the same ecosphere of 3rd party developers that deploy and manage instances of SAP, Salesforce, Microsoft, etc. but that will take years to fully mature that ecosphere. Eventually, Palantir will have robust certifications for various skills and tasks to manage Palantir deployments.

But in the meantime, Palantir's Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) will continue to directly manage deployments. Given how much progress Palantir has made on the tools to improve the efficiency of the FDEs, I no longer worry about the scalability of that team.

Say that three utility companies all buy Palantir – PG&E, ConEd, and Entergy.  Palantir invests 4 years worth of FDE time in PG&E, 1 year in ConEd, and none in Entergy.

* PG&E improves decision making by 10% and does a massive enterprise deal with Palantir to deploy to every part of the organization. 
* ConEd improves decision making by 2% and does a moderate renewal for a few specific teams.
* Entergy bungles their deployment and actually makes worse decision as a result. They do not renew.

Assuming \~$500k/year all in is the cost for a good FDE at Palantir, we're talking about small up front investments that return bigly for PLTR in the long run as those deployments are extended like the BP deal.

To put it another way, when you think about Palantir deployments in months or years, the FDE overhead is spooky. But when you think about those deployments converting into decade long *operating system for XXXXXX* deals, the FDE overhead is not significant.

Also, to be honest, there are very few people with TS/SCI security clearances that even know what React is, much less how to write code against it, so in some of the more sensitive use cases for Palantir, I think that FDEs will be the way for a long time.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#6) Should you YOLO on PLTR?**

I’m not going to give anyone financial advice, but I do want to point out a few things:

PLTR is not a meme stock. Palantir is not a small-cap that can move bigly because, a bunch of furry quadrupeds gathering on internet messaging boards collectively decide that we like the stock. 

Palantir is a bunch of wickedly smart people building Iron Man suits for the largest, most important organizations in the world.

Many of the larger institutional investors still don’t truly comprehend Palantir and the medium term public valuation may not properly reflect the present and future value created by Palantir. I have no idea when the analysts will finally get the value of PLTR.

A lot of historically successful investors think PLTR is extremely overvalued. They may be right. 

A lot of historically successful investors have massive positions long PLTR. CathThey may be right. 

So my crystal ball says PLTR may go up, down, or sideways for longer than you can stay solvent or interested in Karp memes. 

Regardless of the ticker, if you YOLO, please YOLO responsibly my friends, and for the love of god take some off the table if/when you’re fortunate enough to have green dildoes in your accounts– whether your gains are from PLTR or any other stock you happen to like, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#7) My Appreciation for the Palantir Team**

I do want to take a moment and say to anyone who has been a part of building Palantir over the last few decades: what you have built is incredible. Thank you. As an American, thank you. As a stockholder, thank you. 

Enjoy your tendies, you’ve earned them my friends.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#8) How I Play My Lockup**

Regardless of how the markets view the earnings report tomorrow, I’m largely HODLing my remaining Palantir shares, as I think Palantir is in a class of it’s own, lapping the competition like SpaceX and Tesla. 

I do have a professional advisor and we have prepared tax-optimized divestment strategies for a number of scenarios, but none of those scenarios involve paper handing out of my remaining position, regardless of a good, bad, or ugly response to the 2020 earnings report tomorrow.

Why would I sell now if I believe that FAANG-like is growth coming over the next 10 years? Why would I sell when I think Palantir in 2021 is like Mercedes F1 in 2014 about to go on a worldwide domination over the next few years? Also, with the shares finally unlocked, I can borrow against them for the first time.

I've already responsibly taken enough off the table pre-IPO, so I’m not in any rush to sell. My first substantial limit order will be at a market cap of \~$100B with a ladder up to \~$250B. So I’m skeptical that I’ll sell very many shares this more than 5% of my remaining shares this week.

That’s my $0.02 on Demo Day and some of the recent news. 

So long, and thanks for all the tendies. See ya at [the restaurant at the end of the universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34Ig3X59_qA) PLTR gang!

2021-03-04 15:23:22,Where is SNOW heading?,"What do you think will be SNOW's growth and trajectory in the next months, and next year?  
I saw a few posting buying puts pre-earnings, some positive talk but overall little hype except about the lockup end happening on 3/6. So far SNOW is victim of its success with cautious bullishness from analysts, preventing  the market from pushing the stock up like ZM... maybe its growth is a bit more predictable.  


* Quarter results are in, good as expected:  
Q4'20:  
revenue $190M (+117% YoY, beats $178.5M consensus)  
losses -70c/share (vs $-1.67 a year ago, but consensus was an optimistic -17c/share)  
net loss $199M (vs $83M a year ago)  
Q1'21 guidance:  
revenue of $195\~$200M (+92% YoY)  
2021 guidance:  
revenue of $1B\~1.02B (+82% YoY) - is that really too bearish?

Analysts are cautiously optimistic, because the valuation is high but the prospects also very high so it's hard to put a price tag, just like buying a house when the market's hot:  
[https://www.thestreet.com/investing/snowflake-gets-cautious-support-from-analysts](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/snowflake-gets-cautious-support-from-analysts)  
At $71B market cap/$250 share, and a nearly 2X growth prospect, that's 70X 2021 earnings 35X 2022, 20X 2023... Maybe we can assume growth slows around 5B to 10B aka 10% of TAM.

&#x200B;

* Does the employee lock up really matter ?

Lockup ends this week. The vast majority of the shares are held by VCs, the CEO & founders, etc. the hands of a very few. Those shares will likely never see the market, as they're controlling shares. Original B shares had also 10 voting rights, and needed to be converted to single voting right A shares to trade, but it looks like they're disolving this structure. Will these billionaires sell lots of shares? no. And if they do they'll have to disclose. Snowflake has few employees and they don't hold that many shares so would they really influence the market selling? Also would they sell at $250 lows? Is this deadline just FUD fuel?  


* I like the stock.

I'm personally very bullish on the company's future. I like its culture  and the product, I  trust the founders who've worked hand in hand with the angel investor VCs along the way, and I believe they're passionate about the company and product. IDK about the CEO who was brought in later - because of his track record. There's tons of ex Oracle employees working there who understand the business and the customers (it's a customer centric company).  
For me their product is this : it's a classic SQL OLAP database in the cloud that's elastic, with easy management, which has many plugins to do data mining and AI, and fine controls for sharing securely parts of tables (that's big for security inside a company AND for selling data). It is secure enough to be certified to hold medical (HIPAA) and banking data (CapitalOne!). It's also an ""ACID"" transactional database, and its SQL language superset is rich enough to facilitate migration from other vendors like Terradata, Redshift, Oracle, etc. That'll be key to migrate customers from legacy on-prem solutions to cloud.  
Unfortunately it is not an OLTP database so it can't tap customers sensitive to query latency. It's also likely not the fastest to store and manipulate text like logs, though it can handle large JSON and XML data fine, it shines in columnar data.  
Why it's hot I think is it bring old school SQL to the next century as a compatibility story, where other map-reduce cloud solutions failed to become ubiquitous because it was too hard to migrate.  
The big 3 (AMZ, GOOG, MSFT) provide similar offerings BUT AFAIK, they do so packaging old school on-prem databases into cloud servers, so it's a kludge to make it work and the customer ends up dealing with it when they try to use the scalable ""elastic"" part, aka hiring very skilled DBA engineers. There's a reason SNOW customers like the product, stick there and buy more. It's not just because it's cheaper, it's also easier.  
Databases are the foundations to build on top of, and all businesses need to buy strong foundations, SNOW is such an offering with a few years of lead time vs competition in terms of tech. I believe the addressable market (TAM) is like many 10's or 100's of billions estimated with a handful of big players. ""Big data"" and ""cloud"" have been buzz words since Y2K, but that revolution happening now.  
I have a feeling Snow was at the sweet spot: not too early that it needs to justify why you want to buy the product, and not too late to justify why to use them vs other established vendors. I feel it will be one of the mammoths. :)  


* Why I care?

I am overweight on those shares and I need to decide when to sell & diversify my savings. I still feel Snow might be the next CRM or ORCL growth story, but did it just start too hot? Will it go back to $420 within a few month? How good do the news have to be? I certainly don't feel I want to sell at $250, it feels I could be on a rocket's passenger seat waiting for liftoff and I don't want to miss that... At $350? Hmmm... maybe I'm willing to miss some of the liftoff, and diversify to protect myself if SNOW actually trips :P At $420? I definitely would diversify.  


* Palantir

IDK why there's way more hype on Palantir than snowflake on reddit, and why they're compared so much. Maybe it's PLTR's valuation? What's Palantir's addressable market and its competition? Palantir I feel is more of an end user product to do analytics with custom plumbing behind, but I don't really understand their business  value add and how it's different from say Looker or Tableau, and if Palantir's value add is relevant if the data is in a database format compatible with standard tools, which should be the case for most non-gov customers.",3,0.56

Google hitting breakthroughs in quantum computing, this technology will revolutionize the server/datacenter market.

IBM is also a leader in the race to develop a working quantum computer, so they might be a good long term investment if they continue to make sizable improvements on this technology

Update: Just took a look at the pdf published to NASA - here's an important takeaway:

""On Google Cloud servers, we estimate that performing the same task for m = 20 with 0.1% fidelity using the SFA algorithm would cost 50 trillion core-hours and consume 1 petawatt hour of energy. To put this in perspective, it took 600 seconds to sample the circuit on the quantum processor 3 million times, where sampling time is limited by control hardware communications; in fact, the net quantum processor time is only about 30 seconds.""",10,0.78

Is it just me or does this seem totally out of whack to you? Retail is dying, yet $BURL is up 463% in last 5 years and has a P/E higher than Facebook and Alphabet. Clearly $BURL isn't dying - yet. It's actually doing great - for now. I think its sales are just benefitting from more low-income people having jobs and blindly expanding and moving their stores, both of which will be unsustainable during the next crash.

Yet investors are pricing this company like a high growth tech stock. Burlington Coat Factory has minimal digital presence and no plans to expand its digital presence. Executives are old guys from other department stores that have gone down the drain. No influencer marketing or coolness among young people. Surely it can't sustain its current growth and will get pummeled in the next crash right?

Completely new to this subreddit and new to trading, thought you guys could roast me on this because it's clearly contrary to what the pros think and I'm probably missing something.

MVIS has been confirmed as the key creator of the chip that powers the Microsoft Hololense 2. Look it up it’s dope. The US military’s IVAS program is gonna be buying up a shit ton of these.

I know that PLTR is going to the moon, and these past couple weeks have been super frustrating as it seems to currently be refueling for a run up. But while you wait for your pockets to return to tendie town, might be worth checking out a company that does basically **\*the exact same thing\*** that is currently valued at 10x less than PLTR.

Full disclosure - I used to work at Cloudera and was there when they IPO’d in 2017 - the same day as CVNA. At the time, Cloudera was one of the biggest unicorns in Silicon Valley as they had billions in funding from some pretty notable VCs and a hefty amount from Intel.  After a super disappointing IPO, I sold off every share I owned over the next year as companies like Carvana soared. At the time I was convinced that nobody would ever understand the complicated software that Cloudera built and sold, and despite solid growth, lots of enterprise customers, and a road to profitability, it just kind of… fell flat.

That is, until WSB took over the world. Fast forward to 2020 and a PLTR IPO that grew massively over the next several months - I was completely shocked. Yes, I know you’re all retarded but I didn’t know you were \*that\* retarded that you would give PLTR, a company founded 5 years before CLDR with only 20% higher revenue and lower margins, a 10x higher valuation (\~$50 billion market cap for PLTR vs \~$4 billion for CLDR). I have former colleagues that worked with me at CLDR and who now work at PLTR and they think it’s complete insanity that PLTR has a valuation that much higher than CLDR. If you all fundamentally believe that PLTR is worth more than $40 billion, then you are missing a huge opportunity with CLDR.

Cloudera and Palantir use basically the same exact underlying software components to build fundamentally the same exact solutions for their customers. Don't believe me? Go look at the [CLDR](https://github.com/cloudera) and [PLTR](https://github.com/palantir?page=1) Github repos and look for terms like ""hadoop"", ""spark"", ""parquet"", etc. Yes, there are some differences in their product but they are more the same than they are different - at the end of the day the biggest thing each of these companies do is data integration and analytics. However, their approaches, technology influence, and sales methodology should yield a similar or better valuation for CLDR than PLTR for a number of reasons:

* Though PLTR has higher quarterly revenues, CLDR has much better [gross profit margins](https://ycharts.com/companies/CLDR/gross_profit_margin) (81% most recently and increasing vs 63% for PLTR), likely due to their revenue mix being more heavily weighted in software subscriptions vs services. For the latest quarter, [CLDR had 91% of revenue from subscription software sales](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001535379/ec48b119-7c21-4fa4-a3fa-2e3bf020c6fb.pdf) and 8% from services, while PLTR doesn’t seem to break this out in their 10-Q. CLDR subscription software margins are 87% as of last quarter. [PLTR has a 3.5x higher cost of revenue](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001321655/8a404f13-53a8-4610-9f9a-34add0ec1742.pdf) which all but confirms that their mix is much more heavily weighted towards services with 10-20% margin vs subscription software that has 80%+ margin.
* CLDR reported an EPS of  .15 for the [most recent quarter](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CLDR/analysis?p=CLDR), which was a beat of almost 67%. While PLTR reported an EPS of .09 for the most recent quarter, GAAP net loss is much worse (PLTR earnings were -$853M for last quarter and -$110M for the prior quarter, vs CLDR at -$14M and -$36M, respectively). Accounting for the effect on earnings of their recent IPO, PLTR is probably at least 3x less profitable than CLDR despite having been around for 5 years longer.
* As another reference point, FSLY is currently trading at a 3x higher market cap than CLDR on negative earnings with a 3x higher net loss and 3x lower revenue.
* Cloudera has surprised on earnings by at least 50% for each of the last 4 quarters, and should within the next 1 or 2 quarters no longer have a GAAP net loss, and their profitability should continue improving as they continue their pivot to [cloud-based SaaS solutions](https://www.cloudera.com/products/cloudera-data-platform.html). PLTR seems to be years away from achieving the same thing.
* CLDR has broader sales reach and a larger sales force - they have some government customers (e.g. [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.cloudera.com/about/customers/us-census-bureau.html))  but they [target traditional and high tech enterprises](https://www.cloudera.com/about/customers.html). I never competed even one time against PLTR when I sold CLDR software, which shows that they are much too focused on a particular vertical/industry and/or do not have traction in the broader market.
* CLDR has greater influence on the underlying technology stack that both PLTR and CLDR use (and AMZN/MSFT/GOOG clouds) because they contribute more code than any other company to the open source community that they all use. They also partner more heavily with big cloud service providers and technology providers (have [Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/en/bigdata/big-data-appliance/5.1/bigli/cdh5.html#GUID-5B5969CD-FE64-46A2-A7BE-53AF6D11AE77)/[IBM](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/partners/cloudera) co-sell solutions, CLDR software works in all 3 major cloud providers and they have a SaaS solution that runs in all 3 cloud providers)
* CLDR has a [more broadly applicable suite of products](https://www.cloudera.com/products.html), as it can fit in the data warehouse/analytics space, the machine learning space, and the data processing space. It competes with other well-known software like traditional data warehouses (Oracle, IBM, Teradata), cloud native warehouses (Snowflake software, Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift), and data science and machine learning unicorns like Databricks. Because of this, it has broad applicability vs PLTR who seems to target very specific use cases.
* Given its cross-cloud compatibility and influence on the open source technology ecosystem, they would be ripe for an acquisition by a traditional enterprise software company who is trying to gain more cloud traction - for example an IBM or an Oracle. I would not be surprised to see them gobbled up in the next year or two. CLDR has a large growth SaaS solution that [grew 40% in the last quarter](https://investors.cloudera.com/news-and-events/news/press-release-details/2020/Cloudera-Reports-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-2021-Financial-Results/default.aspx) that would be a good buy for any of these old guard companies.
* Both PLTR and CLDR have an 'L' as the second character in the ticker and an 'R' as the fourth character in the ticker which makes them easily interchangeable in any already existing shitposts or memes you've worked on
* CLDR offers a lot of opportunity for cloud and weather-related puns and usage of cloud emojis, which WSB desperately needs more of.

For these reasons and more, I fundamentally believe that CLDR is massively under valued at a $4 billion market cap/$12.68/share and represents a great buying opportunity, especially if you are in the camp that thinks that PLTR should shoot through $30/share, to a $50 billion valuation and to the moon. I mean, SNOW has an absolutely retarded $200 billion market cap. There is no way that CLDR should be valued 10x less than PLTR and 50x less than SNOW.

Positions: GOOG (100 shares, long), SNOW 320c 12/24, CLDR 05/21/21, 20c

**TL;DR** **- If you believe in PLTR,  CLDR makes basically the same products, has a 10x lower market cap, is more profitable, and is worth a serious look as both a solid investment and as a potential acquisition target. Even if you believe it to be half as valuable as PLTR, that's 40$ upside on shares currently standing at 12$ a share.**

2021-01-13 08:33:03,Fitbit: Phoenix Rising from the Ashes,"https://investor.fitbit.com/press/press-releases/press-release-details/2019/Fitbit-to-Be-Acquired-by-Google/default.aspx

The above is over a year old. So what is Fitbit, and why am I posting this now, then?


Fitbit is an American electronics and fitness company which focuses on health-related metrics, tracking, and data analysis. For you, what you need to know is that it sells smartwatches. 

Anyone who cares about watches or fashion at all, you might have heard of Fitbit. As someone who used to be big on high fashion about 2-3 years ago, Moncler was a suave yet not over-the-top brand that a lot of rich Asians and Khabib Nurmagomedov wore. https://i.imgur.com/tiONi3I.jpg. Personally for me, Fitbit has a lot of resemblance - popular enough for the cool kids wear and know, and still good for the boomers due to the functionality. 


Fitbit is ranked 5th worldwide in shipments for watches, behind notably Apple, Samsung, and Xiaomi. https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS46122120


Back in 2019, some of you boomers here might recall an announcement by Google, with plans to acquire Fitbit at a 2.1 Billion dollar USD transaction, which was halted by various legislative and activist communities due to the ongoing battle vs. FAANG+M (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, GOOG(Alphabet) + Microsoft). See: Facebook vs. US of A currently. Let me give you the spoilers on this stuff for the upcoming Biden Administration and the near future: it doesn't matter. 

https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22158271/googles-fitbit-deal-eu-regulator-approval


Big techs rule the world, that's why they are boomer stocks at this point, that's why they are blue chips. Stonks only go up? None of this exists to today without the big tech companies starting the trend and movement into this digital era, into this technological boom. Your teachers use Google to find their sources despite telling to you keep your nose in the books. Your very own senators representatives and law-makers, voting about the 25th Amendment, revisit the constitution thru Google, while actively voting against big-techs taking over the world, using... Google. 


The very same Google is bent on acquiring Fitbit, and has received a conditional-yet-final approval from the EU commission, and will be soon to follow in the USA, I presume not long after the transition of power on the 20th. Google will acquire Fitbit due to their previous failure to breach into the smartwatches market, which exploded some ~4-5 years ago. Apple currently dominates the market, and Google wants a piece. Do you think Google will sit by idly and watch one of their prime competitors claim the throne without contest?


Google recently filed a patent for a smartwatch-design which includes a heartrate tracker. It's very unlikely that after their past attempts at breaking into the watches market, that they will go ahead and just, ""TrY aGaIn"" without the proper measures taken. Fitbit is that proper measure, it's the acquisition which will get them the entry footing they need, to grow. https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-fitness-band-design-revealed-uspto/


But the biggest reason why I'm in Fitbit right now, is because it's a tech-involved product maker coming out of the COVID pandemic, consistently beating earnings expectations for the last 2 quarters of the pandemic, about to report yet another earnings in... ~3 weeks, speculated 1st/2nd week of February. Premiums are beyond dirt cheap also, the stock's been sideways for a year since Google's acquisition announcement over a year ago. Get in before the holiday earnings in early February.


**TL;DR**
- $FIT is a watch company being acquired by Google, after long halts from various legislators and committees.

- Earnings are coming up, have consistently been beat during the pandemic, smart watch market grew ~80% YOY in 2019 and Fitbit's revenues grew during pandemic.

- Premiums are dirt cheap, stock has long to run. If $PTON can grow into 2021, $FIT will certainly rise from the ashes.

**\~Very Long Post\~ \[Don't Read Unless You Like DD\]**

Hello everyone! Let’s start by talking a little about [Alphabet](https://imgur.com/TCH8JFz) , they are one of the biggest companies in the world that generates most of their revenues and income from online advertising services provided through their platforms like Google Search & YouTube while also expanding into multiple other businesses like cloud services and autonomous driving technology through their venture Waymo.

The company was founded in 1998 and has more than 130K employees, with the company performing quite well in the past year gaining more than 30%.

I believe Google will continue to [grow](https://imgur.com/WPLBZGp) as their cloud platform will remain one of the biggest in the world, while also continuing to innovate and develop other emerging businesses that might turn out successful in the long-term, while their main competition is Baidu & Bing for the search engine, but their market share is still completely dominant, as they also compete with social networks & online retailers for advertising placements.

So, guys, let’s go a little through the 4th quarter & yearly results for Google.

Google smashed [earnings](https://imgur.com/AgJQqMp) expectations for the 4th quarter with a beat of more than $6 on EPS and $4B in total revenues.🚀

The company [reported](https://imgur.com/blojVXA) a revenue of almost $57B in the 4th quarter while generating revenues of over $182B in 2020, representing a 12% increase over 2019 as they operating income also grew to over $40B for the first time despite a very slow start to the year through the first 2 quarters as their ad revenues were crushed due to the lack of travel & other leisure industries as those are some of the biggest advertiser income streams for them.

The company sustained a significant growth rate in the past year in their 2 major income segments, with their services business which grew by 11%, and the cloud services which also more than doubled their revenues, but the cloud services is still losing money as they keep investing into expanding their services to compete with the other major cloud players like Amazon, Microsoft & Alibaba.

The [company](https://imgur.com/yhnZZSo) has also started this quarter to report their google cloud results separately to give a more detailed view on how the company is performing, as we can now see how the company has managed to increase their revenues streams and how big the YouTube Ads revenues have become for them as those increased by 30% in the last year. Meanwhile the revenues from Google Search also rose by 6% and the Cloud Segment spiked by 46%, as they also have a big backlog in this segment.

So [overall](https://imgur.com/ZRQtD3X), the company has managed to increase their revenues in constant currency by 14% in the past year while also improving their operating margin by 2%.

Google has managed to keep growing and improving their business operation through major capital expenditures that have accounted for over $22B in 2020. I believe the big spending on capex is really needed, as the competition in the cloud segment in really heating up, so I like companies that keep reinvesting into themselves, as they have also spent over $27B on [R&D](https://imgur.com/5DK8IPa) in 2020, as they keep investing into most of their products and adding new ones in the pipeline.

Also, for the projections of the discounted free cash flow it’s important to [NOTE](https://imgur.com/m5R4niH) that they had over $13B in Depreciation & Amortization in 2020, with this number growing between 15-30% in the past 2 years so I while use a 15% increase for the projections to be safe. The other big number that is important is their overall capex spending, which has gone down in the past 3 years, but as things might ramp up again as they mentioned in their earnings call, I will continue to grow this spending by 2.5%/year expecting things to normalize after the company went for a safer approach in 2020.

[Alphabet](https://imgur.com/jy9opVV) also managed to increase their earnings before interest & tax or EBIT which stood at over $41B while also buying back 1.6% of their total shares in the past year, as they continued buyback [programs](https://imgur.com/wJ8x2BD) in the 4th quarter of 2020, buying back over 4.7M shares in just the last 3 months, thus continuing to reward their shareholders even more

There are a couple of negative outlooks for the company though, as their [effective](https://imgur.com/z2YDQhh) tax rate has increased in the past years, and this might continue to go higher depending on future tax reforms so I will take into account some small raises in the tax rate.

The next problem is the regulatory pressure which can be another bump in the road for Google, but I mostly expect things to drag along and may eventually end with something similar to what happened to Microsoft. Even If they somehow end up breaking their businesses, I think we can see the Cloud business trading at insane P/Es which would increase the actual value of the resulting stocks, while the search engine and YouTube will remain very powerful even without the contracts with OEMs, which would result in better margins and less operating expenses, as most people would still turn to Google for their searches and videos.

The final problem for Google is the privacy issues, but it seems they have found a way to substitute the traditional cookie technology with a new software interface called Federated Learning of [cohorts](https://imgur.com/SumQGc9).

This technology seems to have at least 95% of the same power of conversion per dollar compared to cookies which would be a huge boost to their privacy issues concerns and will help them maintain their dominance in the online ad’s world

But this isn’t the only technology Alphabet is trying to develop, they still have other proposals in works as well, which might come in even better, so we will have to wait and see what they go with.

Meanwhile, Google also offered some [guidance](https://imgur.com/OcOg89t) for 2021 as they expect easy comps in the first half of 2021, while they are planning to ramp up the pace of investments this year.

They also expect to keep investing in cloud segment as their [backlog](https://imgur.com/ypuUDWt) which stands at $30B is mostly attributable to the cloud segment, as Alphabet will continue to focus on long-term growth that will benefit them in the long run as operating results & margins go.

For the price targets, I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on…

So, let’s start with the discounted free cash flow [PROJECTIONS](https://imgur.com/0JTwpv2) to see what the current valuation of the company is.

I used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later in the long-term projection, and the net income for 2020, to which I added back the Depreciation & Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to an EBITDA of almost $55B

For the next years I used a small increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and also applied a 10% decrease in their net working capital.

I increased the capex spending and their D&A as I previously mentioned, so, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the average SP500 return in the past decades and is what I like to use as a discount rate, given the current low interest rates, we get almost $190B Discounted Free Cash Flows by 2025.

Now there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt of the company, which in this case stand at a net $200B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though most of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach.

If we do use the growth approach, we can see that GOOG is slightly overvalued right now, as this implies a loss of about 5%.

On the other hand, a good EBITDA multiple for the company I think is about 20, as the stock currently trades over this multiple, but for safety reasons, I think 20 is pretty reasonable.

And given this multiple & approach we get a valuation of over $2700, or a 32% undervaluation of the company.

But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for Alphabet in 2021 is $2326, implying a 13.3% return from the last price 🚀

Guys, next let’s move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for Google.

For my [PROJECTIONS](https://imgur.com/ZcwoWyP) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream.

I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the Cloud segment for 2021 as businesses keep needing cloud services more & more, and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth rate

For the Google Services (which include Search, YouTube & other revenue streams) I implied a 12% growth, just above last years, as YouTube keeps booming and the leisure industry advertising will slowly come back. But, for reasonable purposes I also implied a gradual slowdown of this trend by 1% each year

I believe these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high market share in the search segment and the demand for cloud services platforms.

The 2 other revenues streams which are Other Bets & Hedging I pretty much left unchanged as they don’t really have that big implications on the final number, but I did add a small amount of growth in both of them.

For their cost of sales, I started from the current ones and maintained them for 3 of their segments, while for the Google Cloud cost of sales I implied a gradual improvement of about 14%/year. So, I am implying they reach profitability by 2024 and reach somewhat of an AWS type of profitability by 2025.

Guys, if we add all of these up, it means for 2025 we would get over $334B in revenues and $237B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $97B.

I also [maintained](https://imgur.com/2MTh00j) the same capex as in the cash flow projections while for the interest income & other incomes which stood at [almost](https://imgur.com/ru1SwIX) $7B this year I implied small annual growths, thus leading us to a $75.4B in earnings before tax.

I also slightly [increased](https://imgur.com/78E0QSN) their 16.3% effective tax rate to about 17.5% by 2025 in order to somewhat account for possible tax changes in the future and also accounted for some share buyback programs of about 1% each year.

So, for the $62B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 653M shares, that would mean a $95.25 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://imgur.com/eSnDXEP) is trading at almost 22 times forward price to earnings for 2025.

Guys, for my personal projections I like to use Forward/PE valuations & multiples, so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $2381 and $3810

After all these estimates what are my price targets?

[HERE](https://imgur.com/Bz3AiJx) are my actual price targets… I think the 2025 bear case price we can see Google trade at is $2619 which would imply a return of 27.5%, while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that Google will trade at 3095$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 50% return on the current price.

My most bullish case though, would see the company trading at $3572, which would imply a return of almost 74%. 🚀

So yeah guys, these are my Overall price [TARGETS](https://imgur.com/ZZ9i4sP) for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 & 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE’s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40.

I think these are pretty reasonable targets, as the cloud services will continue to boom in the next decades, while they will also benefit from an increased reach for their search engine and booming YouTube platform as more people are getting internet access each day, and we shouldn’t forget that they might have even more great products in the pipeline with interesting names like Waymo.

Alphabet also has very good [financials](https://imgur.com/l6B9Qi0), with almost $320B in assets vs just $97B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by the current $137B in cash, cash equivalents & marketable securities

I also like to take a look at what the estimates are from the other analysts, and in this case, we can see an average EPS [estimate](https://imgur.com/Yjf1Cnh) by 2025 of $117, which is way higher than my $95 EPS estimates.

The analysts also expect over $370B in total [revenues](https://imgur.com/JKn4LIJ) on average, which is also more than $35B ahead of where my targets are pointing, so, I think it’s safe to say I have been pretty conservative & reasonable with the growth expectations for the company.

You are probably wondering, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for GOOGLE?

Let’s start by taking a look at this [CHART](https://imgur.com/1qXT9uv), we can see that Google was trading in an increasingly tighter wedge formation since the September lows. Right now, after smashing the earnings report the company has re-entered overbought territory with an RSI of over 70, which we haven’t seen since the big September sell-off. This breakout from this wedge formation came on the back of massive volumes for the stock, so I believe we can see the overbought conditions push the stock lower in the near-term before eventually going back even higher as I expect with my $2326 prediction for the end of the year.

I also think the $1920 to $1935 range can act as future support after it was a good resistance point for the stock

But, let’s also take a quick look at what 44 analysts on Wall Street are [saying](https://imgur.com/AVfkNAo). They are mostly very bullish on the stock with an average price target of $2171 and a high price target of $2610. So, guys, I think the analyst still have some catching up to do with upgrades to the stock after the recent earnings report.

Are you asking yourself, what would I do?

I believe it still has plenty of room to [grow](https://imgur.com/T6YxgoP), so I would start building a position if the stock drops under $2000 and especially buy more if it goes to the previous resistance levels between $1920 and $1935

I also believe that the big % of their shares held by [institutions](https://imgur.com/CaBNOHd), with over 72% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard & Blackrock does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities and increase the support levels power.

So, these are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think Google has a terrific future ahead, with their market [share](https://imgur.com/aCYlMkK) of engine search worldwide crushing the competition and the hole digital ad spending worldwide [forecasted](https://imgur.com/Pc53mtL) to continue to grow and take share of the total ad spending worldwide.

I believe Google will remain one of the best companies in the world while also being a good catch-up play to the other big tech names, as Google has underperformed [compared](https://imgur.com/lcKbD0T) to most of the other big names with the exception of Facebook.

I have looked into investing in SpaceX myself. For small-timers like me (less than $20M investment), the only avenue is a so called special purpose vehicle (SPV), an LLC that in total attracts $20M+ of investment, and is then able to purchase part of SpaceX. Usually, investment minimums are $200-250k, since the max number of investors in an LLC is apparently 100. Unfortunately, the SpaceX SPV's I've found charge outrageous fees. 5% up front, then 2% annually and finally 20% of any profit. That could work for a couple of years, but I think SpaceX is at least a 20 year investment horizon. It may be be the most valuable company in the solar system by then, by some margin, but still.

Other ways to get some SpaceX exposure, which others have mentioned, includes buying GOOG (perhaps 0.5%), and mutual funds BPTIX (3%), or BFGIX (2.6%), which all pretty much sucks.",22,0.74

**What is Magnite and how does it make money?**

Magnite is a sell-side advertising platform (SSP) that aggregates advertising units (aside from GOOG, AMZN, and FB). This is an automated platform that takes these units from publishers across different media channels (e.g., mobile, tablets, Connected TVs, etc.) and then sells them to the buy-side (DSPs like TTD). Magnite makes money through a ""take-rate"" - essentially taking a cut from the publishers sales. That cut is somewhere in the realm of 8-14%

**Why Magnite over company xyz in this space?**

Magnite has big goals. The companies Telaria (leader in CTV) and Rubicon (leader elsewhere) merged in April to be the #1 player in this space. Think back to that management class you took sophomore year of college where they talked about the BCG growth-share matrix. Magnite is a star (or 🚀🚀🚀), meaning it has a **high growth rate** (we'll get to that below) and **high share**

**Why will they keep going up?**

* The space Magnite plays in is HOT (30%+ CAGR). Linear TV (that $200/mo bill your grandma pays DirecTV) is dying, and streaming is taking over 
* Taking this further - Magnite stands to make money off of streaming content that has advertising (AVODs/FAST). The SVOD market (Netflix and co.) has matured, but ad-based content is just now taking off. Think players like PlutoTV, Xumo, Tubi (all acquired by huge players like CBS, Comcast, and Fox this year).

If you want a virgin ripe-for-taking play this week for earnings, i suggest you take a look into Rackspace. Here's my depiction:

&#x200B;

***What the fuck is Rackspace?***

* Rackspace is a cloud services provider that helps companies port data to Amazon Web Services, and also provides infrastructure management and managed application services.
* Rackspace helps Amazon  and Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, VMWare, among others to move data around.[1](https://www.thestreet.com/video/rackspace-amazon-what-company-does)
* Rackspace was once a public company in 2008, but went private in 2016. They IPO'd again in 2020.[2](https://www.bing.com/search?q=rackspace+ipo&qs=n&sp=-1&pq=rackspace+ipo&sc=8-13&sk=&cvid=9E4E05EBDEE34DB096AEA4447519BDBA&first=7&FORM=PORE)
   * Changed their business model from competing with AWS, GOOG, and MSFT to working with and enabling them [3](https://www.thestreet.com/video/rackspace-amazon-what-company-does)

&#x200B;

***Why The Fuck Should I Buy Shares or Calls?***

* Rackspace is one of the few companies in the cloud space that haven't mooned since covid began
   * Compare charts to SNOW, DDOG, NET, etc.
* Currently trades less than 70% it's actual value when compared to stocks in the same sector (see Seeking Alpha: Rackspace Technologies: 70% Upside Is Just The Start)
* AWS, GOOG, MSFT have performed remarkedly since the pandemic has began - a direct beneficiary - you guessed it, RXT.
   * Bookings take 2-3 quarters to have profit realized (now and beyond)   (see Seeking Alpha: Rackspace Technologies: 70% Upside Is Just The Start)
* Insititutions have been quitely purchased millions in stock[5](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/RXT/institutional-ownership/)

&#x200B;

***Why shouldn't I buy rackspace?***

This is a rocket ship folks.

Wal-Mart is $245b
JD is $62b
Flipkart about $20b
Amazon is $836b

Does Google (Alphabet) go in and aquire Wal-Mart? They would control the two biggest foreign markets and allow Wal-Mart to compete with Amazon. The marketing and advertisements and potential is huge. There are a ton of synergies already but it would make perfect sense if Google bought Wal-Mart and cheap for valuation. 

Walmart’s total revenue for the last fiscal was over $500 billion, while Amazon’s net sales were $177.9 billion. Walmart showed net income of over $20 billion, while Amazon’s net income was $3 billion. Yet, Amazon today is among the top five companies in the world in terms of market capitalisation at over $680 billion market cap. 

Why outright aquire them? Access to all markers with a stronghold. And data. Lots of data. 

Amazon has a decent shot at this, given how deeply it understands your purchase history. Google? Not so much, at least not before the Walmart deal. Google Express already partners with some big names—including Costco and Walgreens—but has such a negligible market share that it can’t reliably know what you want, when you want it.

Walmart’s acquisition plan for Flipkart will likely involve Google’s parent Alphabet taking a minority stake in India’s largest ecommerce company, said people with knowledge of the matter. Alphabet will probably invest $1-2 billion after the Walmart acquisition, expected to be announced shortly, they added. Walmart said earlier this month it will pay $16 billion for a roughly 77 percent stake in Flipkart, the U.S. retailer's largest-ever deal.

2020-12-10 07:58:48,The Next PLTR - C3.ai (AI),"I'll make this short and sweet. 

AI is used for making more accurate predictions. If you can make more accurate predictions, you can fucking mint money. What if you could automatically know how much to price a airline ticket to sell out every single time, down to a penny. How about know exactly how many pairs of size 6 leggings you need to make this quarter down to within 0.25%. How about exactly what ads to show someone to maximize dollars spent on Instagram every year. This is what is happening billions times a day behind the scenes.

When you are looking for good software you want to find something that is defensible / complex, yet easy to implement, and obviously valuable to the end user. The reason ServiceNow can charge JP Morgan 60 million dollars a year is because it saves them 500. For C3, deploying these models is easy because they have pre-builts that they can adapt to any business, a platform to run them on, is cloud agnostic, and the internal talent that even medium organizations wouldn't be able to find / use effectively. A single AI implementation can be worth 10s, 100s of millions of dollars to an organization, and you don't think they will be happy to pay [C3.ai](https://C3.ai) through the nose to maintain it? AI capability will be table stakes in 2 years, if it isn't already. This is a pure-play on that. Look at the post IPO pop. Its time to go moon hunting boys.",6,0.53
2020-07-14 10:30:51,DDDD - Will We See A Second Great Lockdown?,"In today's DDDD (data-driven DD), after a long hiatus due to less free time, we'll take another broad view of the current state of the United States economy and public health. We’ll be looking at some data to answer a few questions. Namely, what the state of the pandemic is globally and in the United States, whether or not we will have a second Great Lockdown (yes, historians are now calling this [the Great Lockdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_recession)), statistics on the resumption of economic activity, and the looming unemployment and eviction crisis, and how this all might affect the stock market.

**COVID-19 Data**

On face value, we can see the number of confirmed cases rising exponentially again in the United States, after a flattening of new cases during the lockdown.

[New cases by country](https://preview.redd.it/0ppbgmjkuua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8364b49db7f55f39ec285f7aec731eda1b83f1d4)

This is in contrast to countries like New Zealand, which has been declared COVID-19 free for several weeks, and much of Europe which has significantly reduced new cases and has even reopened for tourism. Within the US, the previous epicenter, New York, has seen a drastic reduction in new cases and is moving towards re-opening.

[NY New Cases](https://preview.redd.it/uww1vjlwuua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0df5aff508e31aa0450e33459a2a2790e5eb505b)

On the other hand, another exponential rise in confirmed cases have been seen in several other states that have fully reopened, including California, Texas, and Florida, the three largest states in the union.

[California New Cases](https://preview.redd.it/969nv8hzuua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=e227e2a481190f3e4d3a28e777a217b19e8ea256)

[Texas New Cases](https://preview.redd.it/7kiy7rv0vua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bcdcc26e402e1456088cb1792a0b4d434522691)

[Florida New Cases](https://preview.redd.it/khrmq322vua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a3f4efe562bcf5d5995747a8042e248d153e3dd)

Part of the increase in new confirmed cases can be attributed to more widespread testing within these states, so we’ll have to look at confirmed deaths to really see if things are getting much worse. If deaths weren’t rising, then the increase in cases could even be considered good news because this implies excessive testing and a much lower case fatality rate than expected.

[California New Deaths](https://preview.redd.it/t6970z73vua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=afc9073e0e402a6c1f6537478e09536c1bbba3df)

[Texas New Deaths](https://preview.redd.it/b7l6gke4vua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=74f3dacdfd5f0e73967cb4e97bce3c80846b323d)

[Florida New Deaths](https://preview.redd.it/ticc80p5vua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1b829f5bf0ae83bde766042de8cc7fba5a615fb)

It looks like there is a true increase in cases within these states. Keep in mind that the new deaths statistics will lag behind the new infections rate by several weeks. The new deaths rate has just started increasing exponentially again at the beginning of July, and this will become even worse, even if governors impose new lockdowns and restrictions because of the delay.

**Will a Second Lockdown Happen?**

The second question to ask is if there will be a second wave of lockdowns. California recently just announced a [rollback in the lifting of restrictions](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/13/california-to-close-indoor-restaurants-movie-theaters-and-bars-statewide-as-coronavirus-cases-rise.html&sa=D&ust=1594749851411000&usg=AOvVaw2qxWTtCYwlbOxvW8cvVKT6) in response to the new increase in cases, setting a precedent for other states to follow suit. However, whether or not there will be a second wave of lockdowns in states is unclear, and depends on several key factors.

*Mask Usage*

Despite initial opposition from health officials telling the public masks do not work, there has been a reversal in messaging, and the government is now encouraging people to wear masks in public. [Even Trump is wearing one in public now](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/opinion/letters/coronavirus-trump-mask.html&sa=D&ust=1594749851412000&usg=AOvVaw0Yj5a4KXhVBc67mi8IEf5m), especially since there is no longer a shortage. The scientific consensus seems to be that surgical masks are effective in preventing the wearer from transmitting COVID-19 to others if they are sick, but not so effective from having the wearer catch it. This has worked in many other countries, especially in Asia, where people might be publicly shamed or shunned for not wearing a mask and potentially exposing others to COVID-19, which explains why places such as Japan and Taiwan have never seen real widespread transmission. However, in the US there is [significant opposition towards mask wearing](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/12/health/california-lifts-mask-requirement-trnd/index.html&sa=D&ust=1594749851412000&usg=AOvVaw38DVurc7sTHBNetNmD_FO2), and wearing mandates may not be widely followed in some states. According to [one study](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.09.20096644v2&sa=D&ust=1594749851413000&usg=AOvVaw3k20celrv3_h--S1KA8gCR), the critical mask adoption rate is calculated to be approximately 73% for the epidemic to be contained. If states are able to successfully convince their population to start wearing masks in public, above that rate, then a second lockdown will not be needed. However, even with a [mask mandate](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/19/us/california-coronavirus-face-covering-order/index.html&sa=D&ust=1594749851413000&usg=AOvVaw3JdCcj0ul9-vtCuYeAPnS3) in California in all places where social distancing is not possible being enacted a month ago, it does not seem to have been widely followed enough to prevent a rise in new cases and deaths. My personal opinion is that most people are now desensitized to COVID-19 news, and no longer care enough to wear masks in public, and hence the 73% critical adoption rate will not be met in most states, even if there is a mandate implemented.

*Political Opinion*

Especially important as it’s an election year, a new wave of lockdowns will likely be dependent on the political popularity of it. I wasn’t able to find any reliable recent polls about it, but based on media and political discourse, it looks like the concern right now is more with saving the economy, with the population desensitized towards COVID-19 deaths. A Single Death is a Tragedy; a Million Deaths is a Statistic. This famous quote can be applied to virtually every natural disaster and massacre. Nobody cared about COVID-19 until March when suddenly Tom Hanks and NBA players were diagnosed with it. Everyone then started panicking and raided their local grocery store to buy up all the toilet paper (for some reason). So what will make people care about the pandemic again?

*ICU Beds*

This is probably the best indicator for when things will go crazy. Once enough hospitals run out of ICU beds to treat COVID-19 patients, they will start having to turn away patients and the case fatality rate will skyrocket. This will likely cause a media frenzy and re-instill widespread panic, shifting political opinion towards more lockdowns. How close are we to this? This statistic is much harder to collect data on and interpret because available ICU beds tend to be fragmented. Since it’ll be logistically difficult to relocate patients to the other side of a state if all the ICU beds in one county fills up, what matters isn’t necessarily how many beds are available in the state, but how many hospitals in each county have reached capacity. Since that’s much harder to interpret and find data on, we'll just look at the available ICU headroom, which does not include potential extra beds that may be created in response to COVID-19.

[California ICU Headroom](https://preview.redd.it/3sdx8la7vua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa5ec78a13e1f26ecf308fad9544bcec1bad0e32)

[Texas ICU Headroom](https://preview.redd.it/5l8h71vbvua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=796ed67e262d180aae0270e4db3bb64da28237a4)

[Florida ICU Headroom](https://preview.redd.it/klgx21bevua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0c21f85eb21bcbb8b0e11394fde26a2c191851a)

From this data, California’s pretty much safe, while Texas’ is close to running out of beds and Florida has pretty much reached capacity.

Another thing to keep in mind is that it will be much more difficult to solve the lack of ICU beds in these states compared to New York. The vast majority of the state’s population live at or near New York City, which is densely populated (in case you’re geographically deficient). This means the problem can easily be solved by simply adding a bunch of beds in one central location, and sending a hospital ship to one place. This can’t really be done in more sparsely populated states like Texas and Florida. Based on this data, we’ll likely see some panic about COVID-19 again in the coming weeks with ICU beds running out in multiple states.

**The Reopening, Oil, and Economic Activity**

[The state of reopening](https://preview.redd.it/zdz0zq3hvua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a47986120b693fc8dcd6b61cc30aac48cec595f)

In general, the north east, which was the hardest hit in March, is still in the process of rolling back restrictions, with most other states having already fully reopened. However, many of the new hot spots, like California, Florida, and Texas, are starting to impose new restrictions. The stock market is starting to realize this, with a selloff happening once California announced a complete rollback of re-opening, closing all indoor dining in the state, and there’s fears that the other hotspot states might follow suit.

[New Jobless Claims](https://preview.redd.it/xlnulkljvua51.png?width=1596&format=png&auto=webp&s=82f15416b73529866b809f98a43e10fb8295e88a)

With a few weeks of many states completely reopening we’re now able to see what the best case scenario for the economy would be. Although dramatically reduced from April highs, there’s still over 1 million new joblessness claims per week, way above pre-pandemic figures. Furthermore, these new joblessness claims have stopped decreasing and are starting to slowly rise back up again, and this is with most of the economy re-opened. Since full reopening in many states are still recent, we don’t have other economic indicators, such as personal savings rate and consumer confidence to see if people are actually re-engaged in the economy or people are still avoiding economic activity out of fear of COVID-19.

Another thing I’ve been keeping an eye on for a while is crude oil stocks. Despite a rally back up from the (negative) lows on the May contract, WTI has been struggling to break $40 and recover to pre-COVID levels, although being near it. While digging through some data [provided weekly by the EIA](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/data.php&sa=D&ust=1594749851416000&usg=AOvVaw3bDA78iR9amTL3rriK4Wvl), I noticed something interesting with crude oil stocks - despite re-opening, it’s still increasing.

[Crude Oil Stored \(kbbl\)](https://preview.redd.it/xdgrc3hlvua51.png?width=1378&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f7694baf5c7b8143c091f38778b736530820382)

Except for one small dip in the middle of May, crude oil stocks have been slowly rising throughout this entire re-opening, despite many oil producers cutting back capacity. Worse yet, an OPEC meeting scheduled later this week is expected to [relax production cuts](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/13/oil-markets-opec-in-focus.html&sa=D&ust=1594749851416000&usg=AOvVaw3uuF8qeo1DP2VKiGuOkdQg), putting even more crude oil into the supply. Excluding the SPR (Strategic Petroleum Reserve), the story looks slightly less scary for commercial producers.

This however does not mean we’re going to be seeing negative oil futures again, since producers have gotten smarter about avoiding a storage squeeze in Cushing.

Refinery utilization, although steadily increasing, is still significantly below pre-pandemic levels.

[Refinery Utilization Rate](https://preview.redd.it/s1l8rl40wua51.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b8926c8faf1baf3282c6b2dd530ece560ebe29e)

The conclusion that can be drawn from this is that oil-based economic activity (i.e. travel and energy usage), while increasing, is still well below what it was in February. Crude oil producers however, are still outproducing what refineries are taking in, and crude stocks have been steadily increasing throughout the entire reopening despite increasing oil prices.

**The Looming Housing Crisis**

Another thing to mention is the ticking time bomb that is the expiration of the unemployment boost provided by the federal government on July 31, and the eviction crisis coming our way as eviction courts reopen and process them. Mortgage forbearances are also starting to expire, with around 8% of all [active mortgages in forbearance](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/10/coronavirus-mortgage-bailout-sees-biggest-one-week-decline-yet.html&sa=D&ust=1594749851418000&usg=AOvVaw2JRDx43Q0y7IYcupImyxDZ). According to [one source](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/08/32-percent-of-us-households-missed-their-july-housing-payments.html&sa=D&ust=1594749851418000&usg=AOvVaw24JU1zP70LJmgOsUopIb3Q), 36% of renters and 30% of homeowners did not pay their full housing payment in time. This will probably take a few months to really see the effects of this, but it’s definitely something to consider.

**How This Might Affect Stocks**

We’re already seeing the first waves of bankruptcies, mostly from companies that were already in a poor financial position like Hertz, JCPenny, and GNC. For the bull case, most of the rally for the past few months have mostly been concentrated in tech stocks, which are much less directly affected by the pandemic, with some companies like Amazon even benefitting from it. They’re usually very financially healthy, and can easily operate in a pandemic, if not benefitting from it. In fact, some stocks like AMZN, TSLA, ZM, and SHOP have gone parabolic in the past few weeks, which is usually not a good sign. On the bear case, most economists predict a prolonged U-shaped or L-shaped economic recovery, and a wave of bankruptcies for companies that couldn’t be rescued by the Fed. As mentioned above, I also believe we’re going to be seeing a second wave of lockdowns in the coming weeks as ICU beds start running out, making the economic situation even worse. Eventually, a shrinking economy, mass unemployment, and reduced spending will ultimately hurt the earnings of even the tech stocks. GOOG and FB earnings ultimately rely on businesses buying ads. AMZN and SHOP earnings rely on consumers buying things. Another argument for the bull side is that due to monetary policies such as QE and 0% treasury yields, along with the unattractiveness of emerging markets in the current economic climate, there is a [massive modern savings glut](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/straub/files/mss_richsavingglut.pdf&sa=D&ust=1594749851419000&usg=AOvVaw0ThBvbFFnJeTPQWxsBHFQQ) \- money that has nowhere else to go. This by itself could take another essay to explain, so I might talk about this more in a future post.

**My Positions**

For those that have been following me the past few months, my positions remain unchanged. After briefly joining the bulls for a few weeks, then 🦘gang, I've now converted back to a 🌈🐻. My only major position right now are VIX calls, with July, Aug, and Sept expiry, which I entered a few weeks ago when VIX was at 26. There's a few reasons for this - I still believe in my [long-term thesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcfn5/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble/) that the stock market is in a bubble, with the past few months accelerating the inflation of it, and my belief that the US will eventually mishandle the COVID-19 response, forcing the government to lockdown again once ICU beds run out. I'm no longer day trading, and will swing trade my current positions when a good selling opportunity comes - I'll keep this post updated if I sell.",1878,0.97
2020-10-17 13:35:09,Alphabet (Google) looks like a good buy for Q4," At 90% buy from 42 different ratings across different sources. I see almost no bearish outlook. The few I do saw claims they don't have enough diversity in income but Alphabet has always been 60% profit from search alone, and none of the companies it's compared to has diversity like Twitter or Facebook with at least three-quarters of profit coming from ad revenue.

2020-09-17 07:11:09,"If we all flush our toilets at the same time, maybe we can trigger a flash crash.","It is no secret that large money managers have been using algorithms to exploit the US stock market. Idiots like Jon and Pete Najarian have made entire careers on following momentum using  ""unusual options activity""  instead of actually doing research and deciding which companies are worth investing money in. A lot of people on this forum have been posting positions in order to feed junk data into people who use these systems to mess with the boomers who are using a technology they could never understand or control. While I think this could have a small effect on the market, I think that a large number of people targeting specific positions both in what they post on this and other platforms and in what they buy could cause a real momentum surge in the stock market that could trigger a flash crash. If I'm wrong, then great, they actually programmed circuit breakers into their programs, and for that capitalism has rewarded them.


If we want to trigger a flash crash we will first want to mess with treasury bonds to make the robots think we're scared. That means the first step to creating a stress test would be to buy, Google search, and discuss positions that will drive down treasury yields. Treasury yields go down when people are buying a lot of bonds. Therefore, we should buy these positions:

If we do that, pile into sane ones, Google, tweet, Stocktwit, and push a bunch of data that generates artificial momentum, we can make sure there aren't any flaws in the current regulatory framework. Maybe we can make some money too. Maybe I'm wrong, but it would be a sick prank if it worked. Feel free to comment with ways you think we can improve the stress test.

Edit: Contrary to the opinions of commenters, this shitpost is properly labeled as DD. The issue yesterday was that people were shitposting without doing their due diligence. This shitpost has done its due diligence. Minutes of research went into precision targeting and I changed dates and strikes to make it look less like spam. I even name dropped the Najarian brothers, googled pre-crash bond activity, and proposed ways to strengthen the dollar. Wording was purposely made in a way that was easy for the robots to read.

One  of the signs to look for when identifying a reversal is darkpool  buying. Today, the darkpools stopped selling as much and started to  increase their buying:

&#x200B;

[Our current dip is on the right side of this image. DIX is in blue, sp500 in green](https://preview.redd.it/s4lfm56u90m51.png?width=459&format=png&auto=webp&s=87e22a8c3b3fbb4db0f36efac498418af5352d65)

&#x200B;

There is a historical precedent for an increase in darkpool buying marking the bottom of market pull backs and corrections.

&#x200B;

[This  chart shows the market correction at the beginning of 2018, the end of  2018, both trade-war pull backs in 2019, and the yield curve scare in  Sept\/Oct of 2019. SP500 in green, DIX in blue. Note the DIX increased  aggressively near the lowest point of each correction\/pullback.](https://preview.redd.it/wic5n5uv90m51.png?width=341&format=png&auto=webp&s=571c724bed4d618e38fcab8ce40f0be25a4970e0)

&#x200B;

The  DIX is currently at 39%, up from a low of 35%. At each of the previous  market bottoms marked by darkpool buying in the figure above, the DIX  was from left to right: 47.7%, 48.2%, 45.5%, 45.3%, and 40.6%. This  suggests if the DIX were to rise into the mid 40% range, we should  expect a market reversal.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Looks  like the market has pulled back to it's 50 day sma for both major indexes  as well as most of the large cap and tech stocks. This behavior is  common during market recoveries throughout history. The increase in  darkpool buying supports the idea that we are either at the bottom of  this dip, or nearing it, based on historical DIX numbers during pull  backs and corrections. This is encouraging, perhaps its time to start looking for entries.

&#x200B;

Quick edit for you goobers - wait for confirmation that the 50 sma holds. Breaking below it is bad news.

Edit 2: Confirmation of a bounce is often thought of as the first day to open and close above the 50 sma. Some like to see more, or specific reversal candle patterns as well. It is likely the job opens report that comes out Wednesday morning at 10am est, or the unemployment claims on Thursday, could be the catalysts to drive a bounce. For those that want to monitor confirmation to the down side, this is often viewed as the first 1 day candle to open and close below the 50 sma, and if the job openings data and unemployment claims report are shit, expect more down side.

Edit 3: also note the vix is starting to come down a little as well. Reddit only allows 20 crayon drawings per post, so I left this one off. ",71,0.89

2020-11-02 18:05:54,"ADT, down 33% in 6 weeks. Earnings Report after hours on Thursday, Nov 5","Can somebody please convince me not to do this?! I feel like I’m taking CRAZY PILLS!!


So ADT is reporting earnings on Thursday night. 

Google bought a stake in them 3 months ago to acquire 6.7% of the company. Average price, $8.22. $450m worth of stock, pricing the company at a valuation of $6.7b. 

Current price, $6.70. Current valuation: $5.5b

Yes, GOOG is bagholding -18.5% on this. They have the option to acquire up to 9.99% of the company in total in the terms of their agreement.

The price shot from $8.50 to $17.00+ that day and spent a week or two selling off, down to something like $11-13.50 throughout the following days that ensued.

6 weeks after Google’s buy-in, there was a secondary public offering that then dropped the shares from $10.80 to $9.22 in a single day (-14% drop). Turns out it was the majority shareholder, Apollo Management, and they priced the shares at $10. Yes, ten dollars. The additional shares to market implied a dilution of 5.5% on the total float, yet the price dropped 15% likely because ADT was receiving no proceeds of the offering, by nature of it being an SPO by Apollo.

ADT $7.5c 11/20
  
ADT $10c 11/20

Earnings play. Thoughts??

TL;DR - ADT is reporting earnings on Thursday night. They are currently down 18.5% from when Google acquired 6.7% of their company three months ago. They are also down 33% from the price of their secondary public offering that was placed 6 weeks ago. Their last quarterly report was bullish on guidance.

EDIT: Good going guys, ADT calls are up 200%, from $0.15 to $0.45 from this post. The underlying went from $6.50 to $8.00. I know the broader market rallied too in many ways, but go fuck yourselves",9,0.74

\-AMZN

\-NFLX

Things to keep an eye for: 

\-JMIA

\-ZM

\-RKT

\-PTON

For this week:   
Overall bearish context looming over the overall market due to no stimulus. Tech will dip and so will the S&P. QQQ will dip and so will S&P, but it will hold on a level, thou Im not sure where. One it hits that level it will drive pretty aggressively (AKA V shape.) This is in anticipation of earnings for the week after.  Feel free to drop a number down below on where you think it will hit. I can do a follow up on everyone's average, that should give us a the ""wisdom of the crowd effect"", and give a good estimate on where it will stop. Come back to the post for the QQQ number. I'll update this on Sunday.   

A note is that AMZN's earning is on Thursday, so it's possible that AMZN will be greener than the rest. Thou the day after Im expecting AMZN to tank. Thou it's too pricy for my taste to play. (This is moved so it's not true anymore.)

Bullish for week of Oct 26-30, but super bearish on 10/30.

Long: Looking for entry for AAPL, GOOG, FB, SPOT, SHOP, this week for overall market dip.

2020-08-30 10:32:09,The hidden TikTok Play emerging,"TL;DR - Buying FB calls if TikTok Deal with China falls through is the most likely play.

Bullet points because walls of text suck. 

-Microsoft and Walmart have tons of upside if they acquire TikTok. Play calls on either if they get it.

-China is super salty towards America and Trump right now going as far to pass a law to lock tech (including TikTok) in China. If Trump wins the election, TikTok stays in China.

-India already banned it. US essentially banned it. Other countries will follow suit as global confidence and trust in China falls. The only thing that saves TikTok if it’s stays in China is a Biden win and reversal of the ban. I’m not even sure Biden will have the balls to reverse the TikTok ban. 

-Facebook owns Instagram. Instagram owns Reels. If TikTok dies in the US reels is the new dominant front runner($FB) because of their market share and younger audience.

-Bonus time: Watch Google - they have low key been testing out a story feed which is an easy jump to a Tik tok scrolling platform. Google already has your data, ad dominance, partnerships with music/movie studios and market presence. Better yet, kids don’t think of google as a “boomer company”. Anyone else who enters the market is a wild card but I suspect the power of Facebook or Google can handle the takeover. 

-Buy FB or Google calls 6 months out. Gotta get past the volatility of the election and people holding their money through January.",23,0.83

How I see is each of these events  on its own won't make much of a difference, but rather all of them working off of each other. Here's what I see.

Monday the stimulus bill proposal should be announced.

Tuesday FOMC press conference with JPow.

Wednesday and Thursday has earnings for FB, SHOP, and AAPL.

Thursday has GDP report for Q2.

If the proposed stimulus bill isn't as big as expected, JPow may make a comment on how he can't prop on the markets on his own. With earnings of these tech companies, the standards are really high and if we don't meet expectations, tech doesn't look like a safe haven anymore. GDP report could reinforce the necessity of a strong stimulus bill.

If all of this happens, I can see the market start a W shaped recovery. On the other hand, if one of these events doesn't look too bad, the rest of the news will be made insignificant and we continue upwards towards and probably passing ATHs.

2020-08-04 01:27:00,AAPL will become the first $5 trillion company,"Reasons:

1. Apple Silicon and its semiconductor ventures
2. Apple Glass
3. Apple's investments in autonomous vehicle technology and its other operations in the autos sector
4. Insane buybacks and its commitments for being cash neutral within a few years(For reference, AAPL spends almost as much money on buybacks as the Government of Bangladesh spends on its budget to manage a country with a population of 165 million people)
5. Apple Pay and other transaction facilitation platforms
6. Their growing device portfolios
7. Their growing services portfolios
8. Anti-trust wins
9. Others. :)
10. But probably the biggest of all, the case for Apple bulls has been growing stronger and stronger as it reaches higher valuations, which is not quite applicable for AMZN or MSFT. Sure, market sentiment is fickle, but AAPL seems to have remained consistently out of bearish sentiment for quite a while, whereas AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, FB all faced it. Though it may be partly explained by its buyback program and Berkshire's involvement.
11. Fed (it applies to all others too).
12. Inclusion in almost every type of portfolio and indexes. Dividend investors, growth investors, day traders(obviously), speculators etc.
13. Brand image and China(some would argue it is Apple's thorn, but I would argue otherwise).

2017-06-26 07:04:23,GOOG still the belle of the ball? DD inside.,"So I was bingin' around the web like I do every morning, when I stumbled on this website called Google. At first, it looks just like a crappy search box but behind it all is a $635B market cap.  
I dug deeper and while it's true that most of their revenue comes from ads, they just launched Google streaming live TV for $35 a month, which is way cheaper than cable and Google Fi phone service which is 50% the cost of other mobile services. In fact, the mobile offering is even pay by gb for data and easy international support. Both of these things significantly benefit the consumer, but also give them a long term prospect of bleeding cable and mobile carriers. Not to mention Google Play / Red subscriptions have been killing it with consumers much more willing to subscribe and purchase on demand content these days. The stock is nearing $1000 but the continued consolidation of all data transmission suggests to me that it's still a long term buy. Any reasons to think otherwise?",1,0.57

***Volatility Expectation =*** I expect the market to move less than 5% +/- over the next two weeks. Vix expectation is 1.13% to 1.57% (18 to 25) +/- and VVIX to move 7 to 10 points +/- or between 115 to 125

**Full Summary & Rational For Trade** Realized and Implied volatility will continue to trend lower over the next few weeks. This will provide traders structural opportunities to profit from selling elevated convexity into the market via Put Write/ Call Write Strangles, which are 5% out of the money. Traders will assume the role of Insurance Companies for two weeks selling premiums via writing policies and keeping the profit at the end of the two weeks. Profit from it

**Brief on Trading Suggestion**; We will temporarily be in a period of reduced swings up and down (lower realized & implied volatility)

**The rationale for the Trade;** The market will remain relatively range-bound over the next few weeks. This will present traders with the perfect opportunity to profit from selling volatility back into the market. A low return environment and possible negative curve (with Federal Reserve Balance Sheet Expansion acting as a useful backstop) invite investors to re-engage temporarily in seeking to exploit timely carry trades by selling volatility back into the market.

**The Risk for the Trade**; The risk is any large increase in realized volatility, which causes the equity market to move up or down greater than 5% to 7% this week. This would create substantial problems to the right or left side of the distribution curve. What we would like to happen is the movement of >4% and <(-4)% for the full week.

Blink has a massive charging system through the US, and has a market advantage because of the fragmented nature of everyone else. Other than the  TSLA system, which is limited to the TSLA cult. If the valuation continues to rise, a company would try to buy it because of FOMO. It's too difficult for new competitors to build their own infrastructure network, especially when they're dealing with far out the #1 non Tesla charging company.

Who to buy? AMZN? GM? GE? GME? GS? GOOG? GLD? I guess stay tuned.

I'm thinking that they'll report well, been seeing TONS of Chromebook orders going out through schools which means all of those schools are signing contracts for Google Classroom.  Also, been seeing them ramping up advertising for YouTube Premium and their merging of their Movies and Music offerings into YouTube seems promising.

Technicals looking like they're setting up to break out of the down-trend from the early Sept. dip at some point today.  Last time they touched it, they gaped down, so I'm waiting till that's confirmed before buying.

The ONLY thing I'm hesitant about is the Anti-Trust spotlight these fuck-wit senators are putting on them and if that'll be enough to keep investors out.

Edit: Some additional chart TA (for whatever it's worth) shows that this may still have some room to dip, I'm estimating around next support level $1,360-ish.  I've put on a short credit spread, then will inverse if I'm right or wrong, whichever comes first.",6,0.72
2020-06-27 08:05:47,Investing Videos (and a favor request to the most powerful subreddit),"From Martin:

 

Hi everyone. I really appreciate the kind words, especially with respect to the various videos I made. Unfortunately, something happened to my YouTube account. Let me lay out the details, and perhaps someone here works at Google or YouTube, or knows someone who does, who can help. This is a bit verbose, but my experience in matters like this is that it pays to be too detailed. 

 I use a certain gmail as my 'main email'. I also have a dozen email addresses associated with various companies I've been involved in. For some reason I started making YouTube videos with one of those email addresses, not my main email. Before I could realize it, I figured, well, that'll just be my YouTube account and I'll never lose access to that email, right!?

 One joke about Hillary Clinton's reptilian DNA requiring careful procurement and examination to determine the Alex Jones-style truth of the matter, and I found myself in what could only be described as 'sleepaway camp for thugs'. The corporate email I used ended up dying due to nonpayment. Banks like to cancel their relationships with me abruptly, and the folks I put in charge of maintaining this kind of thing didn't do so great of a job. So that email attached to the YouTube with thousands of videos, millions of views, died. Then the channel died. I am 99% sure the channel is not in trouble for any violation of policy. I just think when the email is unresponsive (and YouTube is constantly sending you all kinds of spam garbage), YouTube closes your account. 

 I have access to the email in question once again. Attempting to login to YouTube with said email is not permitted since its not a gmail. This begs the question of how I used to do it before. Well, I had GSuite. So, my team signed up for GSuite again. Signing into YouTube takes a 30 day ""seasoning period"" (I have no other way to put that... probationary period?) before you can access YouTube. That should be up in a few weeks. I'm not holding my breath that all the videos will be there when we log back in.

 As many of you know, YouTube does not have a customer support function. Everything is done to make it as hard as possible for the customer to get help. So Question 1: is there an alternative channel for YouTube customer support that we're unaware of? Question 2: Does anyone have a 'plug'--either an employee at YT/GOOG or someone who knows a human being there that is willing to take 15 minutes to figure out what happened and help. 

 For me, YouTube videos were a way to show anyone who was interested a window into the 'real' me. The mainstream media concoction, which I enjoyed creating, was a fun ruse but also a self-propagating and hard to control monster. Thankfully, the authentic Shkreli was live on YouTube for all to see. Most people who saw videos of me came away with a favorable impression. Without those videos, the NBC narrative prevails. Thanks for your thoughts and attention on this matter. As a gift, I leave you with the thought that I would avoid being long any coronavirus-related securities as they universally appear to be overvalued to this observer. That's not financial advance, that's #facts.",264,0.88

1) tiktok deal will be official in month or two. Bytedance has submitted their request for an export license to the CCCP. We know the orange idiot has already approved so it’s a formally on the US side. When it’s approved, FSLY will pop over 100. 

2) Amzn just announced LUNA, their cloud gaming service that will compete with Goog and aapl’s. It will integrate with Twitch. Little known is that Amzn signed a huge deal with FSLY last quarter to provide all IO (image optimization) for Amzn’s services. AWS has its own CDN (Cloudfront) and they went with FSLY.  If LUNA is any sort of a hit, it would be hugely beneficial to FSLY top line. 

3) Last q, FSLY agreed to purchase Signal Sciences, a cloud security startup that is growing triple digits. Recognition of SS’s revenues will be include in the upcoming ER (11/05).  This would be an additional 100mill+ added to FSLY’s rev projections for 2021.

Personally, I live on the wild side. Holding $AMZN $4,100 9/25 Calls. I will be YOLO-ing an additional $8,000 on various mega stocks in the next few days.

* **MARKETSHARE CREEP**: As the collective US/EU retail industry looks around and wonders if they should be establishing or growing their competitor's cash cow, they'll be looking to strategically invest elsewhere. There are only a handful of major IaaS providers: Microsoft, Google, IBM. Microsoft has greater IaaS market share than every other remaining hypersized cloud player combined.

For the time being, $BABA and $MSFT have culturally different clientele, providing a favorable moat to $MSFT in the US and with allies (UK, EU, AU, NZ) and the Western hemisphere neighborhood (LATAM). Of course, that's before we get to PaaS, which $MSFT serves as a leader in some of the most cutting edge (AI/ML, IoT), and as the uncontested king of on premise and hybrid cloud in enterprises.

&#x200B;

* **THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX HATH SPOKEN:** Unless you're living under a rock, you've probably heard about JEDI and DEOS. The monopoly that $AMZN once enjoyed in the cleared space  is now in the crosshairs of \*\[the new\] big blue. This opens the door for Microsoft to gain all types of opportunities in the highly profitable federal space, and some of which it is uniquely positioned for with it's Azure Stack Hub and array of edge devices. Microsoft, with it's already deeply established sales and relationships with the DoD, will have no problems capitalizing on this opportunity. It's only just beginning. Microsoft can leverage a huge partner base, and don't forget that US defense companies can increase that leverage too.
   * Azure Stack Hub is a hybrid cloud platform by Microsoft that can be run fully disconnected and power containers (Kubernetes, Docker), other PaaS platforms (Pivotal CF, Red Hat OpenShift), and more. The solution has a multi-year head start in the availability in the marketplace, ahead of AWS competing solution Outpost - of which does not support fully disconnected scenarios.
* **O365, DYNAMICS, LINKEDIN, AND GITHUB ARE EASY MONEY:** $MSFT is enjoying the fruits of its acquisition(al) labors on one hand, and the easiest inflows of cash via O365, which will see increased growth as more cleared / defense onboard into O365 and dog-whistle Teams.
* **ENJOYS THE TAILWINDS OF A RECORD YEAR**: $MSFT and Azure are coming along from record highs, with yearly gains between the 50-60% respectively. If you're bullish on the S&P 500/DOW, you can be bullish on Microsoft - and expect it to outperform. Microsoft has enjoyed steady climbs after most favorable earning events, provided its largely institutional (\~73%) ownership isn't panicking.
* **ADD per** u/ryryshouse6 **THE GREEN BUTTERFLY AFFECT:** As ETFs, funds, and retail investors will continue to gravitate toward environmentally-friendly companies, $MSFT serves as a very attractive Software Service option for managers to justify taking or increasing stakes with $MSFT. Microsoft already enjoys an overall ""Leader"" ESG score vs. Software industry according to MSCI ESG Research 2019 report, not taking into account the recent $1b investment to go carbon-negative by Microsoft.

2020-04-14 22:34:49,Yelp - The Sick Company of the Tech industry,"With Q1 earnings coming up, we're going to start something we haven't seen in a month - price discovery. Gone are the days where we have literally every stock in the S&P500 go red in the same day, and where SPY puts are guaranteed to print. RIP SPY 220p 4/17 bagholders. Now you degenerates need to become literate and do your own research by digging through the financials of individual companies to figure out which ones will and won't survive this pandemic. Today I'll show you an example of how to do this. Keep in mind this is not financial advise and you shouldn't buy some random puts because some person on the internet said it might print in a week; do your own DD. Ok let's begin

**Inspiration**

It's obvious that small businesses are fucked. PPP and EIDL grants, which is meant to sustain small businesses until they can re-open, is a mess with the vast majority of businesses still not getting the money. Even with these loans, it might give small businesses a month or two of extra cash, it won’t be sustainable if we keep needing to lockdown the economy for the next 18 months until a vaccine is introduced.

So let’s use that fact to see what we should take short positions in. What stock has the most exposure to small businesses? $YELP. Let’s look at a breakdown of their financials for the year ended 2019 from their most recent 10-K. Let’s look at some select pieces of their financials to see how they’re doing.

**10-K Deep Dive**

*Income Statement*

|Revenue|1B (970M from ads, 30M from other)|
|:-|:-|
|Cost of Revenue|62M|
|Operating Expenses|977M (Sales: 500M, Product Dev: 230M, G&A: 135M, Depreciation: 50M)|
|Operating Income|35M|
|Net Income|50M|

Effectively all of their revenue is coming from ads. Another interesting fact here is that for every $1 of revenue they’re getting, they had to spend $0.50 in sales. Let’s take a closer look at where this ad money is coming from.

*Revenue Sources*

|Home & Local Services|35%|
|:-|:-|
|Restaurants|14%|
|Beauty & Fitness|12%|
|Health|10%|
|Shopping|8%|
|Other|21%|

Yelp recently announced on April 9 that 1000 employees are being laid off and 1100 are being furloughed, presumably mostly sales, out of a total of over 6000 employees. Also, in the period between Mar 10 - April 9, it has also seen page views for restaurants drop 64%, nightlife 81%, fitness 73% and beauty 83%. Clearly their revenue's going to be fucked for Q1 and Q2, and won't be recovering for a while.

*Balance Sheet*

|Current Assets|533M (Cash: 170M, Securities: 242M, AC: 107M)|
|:-|:-|
|Total Assets|1B|
|Current Liabilities|134M|
|Total Liabilities|315M (Only LT liability being leases)|
|Stockholders Equity|755M|

They’ve actually come into this crisis with a balance sheet that most public companies can only dream of. They literally have no debt (aside from leases), and ALOT of liquid assets, mostly from the giant influx they received from GrubHub when they sold Eat24 to them for $288M. They’re at no risk of bankruptcy, being able to survive at least 6 months with no revenue without cutting anything back with their liquid assets alone. But this is where the good news ends for $YELP investors.

**Yelp - The Sick Company of the Tech industry**

Here’s their stock performance since their IPO in 2012

[$YELP 2012 - 2020, monthly](https://preview.redd.it/zeenp3nr4xs41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=c162aede36deada90444a1adf511cfcf0fa896c4)

Even before COVID-19, their stock price has barely increased since their IPO. Their IPO price was $22 in early 2012. In January 2020, it was trading at around $35, representing an increase of 36% over 8 of the best years in the stock market’s history, especially for tech stocks like Yelp. In comparison QQQ grew by nearly 230% in the same time period.

Yelp was founded in 2004, around the same time as Facebook. If Yelp was going to have an explosive growth period, like what almost every other tech company, they probably would have had it by now after 8 years since their IPO. Instead, this is the kind of growth they’ve been seeing in their 2019 fiscal year.

|Revenue|\+8%|
|:-|:-|
|Operating Income|\+37%|
|Net Income|\-26%|
|Current Assets|\-38%|
|Liabilities|\+215%|
|Stockholders Equity|\-30%|
|EPS|\-16%|

So they’re struggling to grow revenue, especially for a medium-cap technology company. Not only that but their earnings and equity is decreasing in what should have been a great year for small businesses and the economy, signaling that the company is slowly dying. They’ve also given up on international expansion and are focusing on protecting their US market share from Google, and it looks like they’re losing.

It also looks like they’ve also spent an enormous amount of their Eat24 cash last year, but it clearly didn’t go towards growth, so where did it all go?

**Propping up the $YELP share price**

During 2019, Yelp has spent $481M (20% of its Jan 2020 market cap) to buy back 14M shares, 20% of its 71M shares outstanding. For perspective, competitors $GOOG and $TRIP each repurchased less than 2.5% of their shares during the same time period. Instead of using that cash to grow their operations, they’ve been using it to artificially prop up their stock. Now, even with a strong balance sheet, they’re going to need all the liquidity they need to avoid having to shrink their already dying operations, and have announced suspending their stock repurchasing program. It’s pretty easy to see the distortion in the valuation of their stock that’s been caused by their stock manipulation - just look at its P/E ratios compared to its competitors.

Using April 14 prices

|$YELP|37|
|:-|:-|
|$GOOG|26|
|$TRIP|20|
|$NDAQ|22|

Using Jan 1 prices

|$YELP|67|
|:-|:-|
|$GOOG|26|
|$TRIP|34|
|$NDAQ|23|

Seems pretty overvalued to me. Now that they’ve stopped their stock repurchasing, we’ll slowly see $YELP fall towards it’s true fair value.

**Price Target**

They’re not going bankrupt, but this recession / depression will definitely accelerate the death of their operations, a process that started when Google first released Google Reviews. As of right now, it’s worth at least the book value of their equity - a 755M market cap, or $10.50 per share. Another simple way to look at it is to apply the PE ratio of its most similar competitor in terms of size and revenue disruption, $TRIP, which would give it a true value of $10.55. Of course, this is using their balance sheet and earnings from 2019, which has probably already been feeling the effects of the lockdown. Their next earnings call is expected to be 5/14, so we’ll see the real damage then.

**Technicals**

This won't be a true wsb DD without drawing some magic lines on the price charts, so I'll do a brief rundown of what I see from my horoscope.

[$YELP, daily](https://preview.redd.it/ikp9abvp4xs41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=80b1e57304335852cdef4b5e24c9fd1d6fd24c1f)

$YELP has been roughly following the trends of the stock market as a whole since the crash began, but we’re now starting to see actual price discovery in the market (eg. $AMZN hit a new ATH today). It’s currently in an upwards trend towards $22, which has historically been a strong support / resistance level for the past few years, is the 38% retracement level, and is also their original IPO price. It looks like they will fail to break the $22 resistance, fall through the ascending trendline, and resume plummeting before the end of next week.

**TLDR; Learn to be literate. YELP 15p 8/21**

EDIT - Triangle just broke, crash has started

* ""You said google doesn't work with the chinese military, but your partners are all CCP affiliates in china"" (not a question)
* Pichal testified that ""We don't manually intervene in any specific topic"" yet memos show that google does. Is being called out for lying. Watchlist is maintained by policy and enforcement specialists to enforce or enrich policy violations and done in the tool (some internal tool). Lied about this tool.
* Manual blacklist targets are directly against president trump. Labels people as terrorists. Damn. Fuck GOOG.

## Zuckerberg:

Phony by buying Instagram and knocking off stories from $SNAP, ""**Facebook is officially a monopoly"", ""Spends 5-10% of MKT cap to grab land of the social space"".**

* JAYAPAL: ""HOW many competitors have you copied""
* ZUCK: ""I.. uhh. can't""
* JAYAPAL: ""Has FB ever copied competitors while trying to buy them""
* ZUCK: ""Not to my... \[interrupted\]""
* JAYAPAL: ""Facebook cloned a popular product.. if they didn't let them buy you \[Instagram\] up bad things would happen. What other companies did you do this to?""
* ZUCK: ""Uhh, I wouldn't do that""
* JAYAPAL: ""Did you threaten Evan Seipgal, founder of snap, that you were building a competing feature {stories} while negogiating a buyout?""
* ZUCK: \[diverts question\]
* JAYAPAL: ""Facebook is a monopoly power and copies, acquires, or kills competitors""


Round 3 of questions:
* Did you know the metrics about ad revenue for journalists was false 7 years before publicly showing this.? No questions, cut off
* Does google use chrome data to target advertisers? BS answer that google uses data
* You do use data from chrome for these purposes? We use data to target ads which we giver users a choice to be specifically targeted.
* Do you make money over news rigging?

## Tim Cook
blackmailer of the app store.

## Bezos

* wants to rule the world, peddles crap for $, **hates mothers, ""kills competitors like a leopard after a sickly gazelle"", ""amazon undercutting partners is best for the customer"" lol**
* Amazon copied vokalife (name?) and then developed Alexa echo after engineering data was shared and stop responding to emails.
* Tied to slave labor (Zuck smirked when this was said)
* Is using power in Alexa for leverage in negogiations. Jesus. Knew those things are the devil.
* Does amazon price under cost to own the smart home? (No, but it's always on promotion lol)
* Is smart home market is a winner take all market? No, but we try to acquire compliments to our market positions. Aka, we're a monopoly.
* Is alexa trained to favor amazon products? They do promote their own products.

## Slave labor

Reminder, this is under oath. They say they'll terminate contracts so they legal have to.

* Q: Will you certify if that you do not use slave labor?
* A (Apple): ""We would not tolerate it"" doesn't say no
* A (Pichal): ""Happy to engage with your office?""
* Q: I don't want you to engage
* A: (Pichal) Agree
* A: (Cook) Agree
* A: (Bezos) Agree will terminate relationships
* A: (Zuck) Agree, will terminate relationships


## HCQ

* (TO Pichal) When I clicked on youtube links for doctor protest, it was taking down. How can doctors giving opinion be against the community guidelines. Especially when videos of violence (protests) are let on the site?

Looking into next week, again for the SPY we need to think in terms of Geopolitik Say AMZN struck a deal in South Asia and MENA regions, they're set to dominate the ecommerce market there, oh just one problem. all the goods from vietnam / US can't get there because the South China Sea is being blockaded. Or GOOG invents an improvement to instant results, ie Mind Results, results pop up on your android even before you type anything, and it works on 50 different languages. Whoops won't matter if they are banned in Asia due to US loosing allies over there. Tiktok case is the reverse example of this.

Who makes the most money ultimately comes down to who have MORE GUNS(and wins wars),  we will see how this play out over the next few months along with the rona pandemic. It's been this way for thousands of years ever since Roman times. This view is also echoed by the world's biggest Hedge Funds.

>Governance between countries is very different from governance within countries.  That is because within countries there are laws and standards of behavior that govern, whereas between countries raw power matters most, and laws, rules, and even mutually agreed treaties and organizations for arbitration such as the League of Nations, the United Nations, and the World Trade Organization don't matter much.  Operating internationally is like operating in a jungle in which there is survival of the fittest and most anything goes.  That is what makes having a strong military so important.

We see a total of 17 million continuing jobless claims, with the CARES act expired on 7/31, no more 600 dollars a week to spend on necessities/iphones or for YOLO in RH. That just reduced about 10.2 Bn USD consumer purchases from circulating in the economy. These 17 mil people may be displaced structurally as in those jobs are not coming back even if the pandemic ends. Previous record was about 7 mil in 2009

**GDP Growth rate**

[https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp-growth-annual](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp-growth-annual)

Annualized was -32.9% but the actual growth rate for Q2 was -9.5%, doesn't sound as bad,  in line with Euro economies but still bad.

Doing stupid simple math to illustrate a concept :

(SPY before Rona) x GDP Change x USD value change

**339 x 0.905 x (1 + (99.82-93.42)) = 326.42**

***It doesn't actually work like this, models are complex, just an example to illustrate a concept of relative value*** Markets are forward looking so if you're planning to do something like the above you should forecast Q3 GDP growth.

As a nation that can just basically print money, getting a negative outlook is a big deal, if the US were to lose its  AAA credit rating expect more expensive debt issuance and fiscal problems down the road.

## TL,DR: In Summary

**China Clash + Rona Pandemic + Fed maintain current pace + No new stimulus deal until 8/7**\*\*

With those factors  SPY will finish below 327 next week. For entry confirmation assuming no news of new stimulus deal reached  I'll wait until it  dips below 325 on Monday after lunch then If it does  get in

**Vertical calls credit spreads :**

# SPY SELL 327C 8/7

# SPY BUY 332C 8/7 (Optional)

***Note: When writing calls this close to the money, you should have enough capital to handle early assignments, if you don't then move the strike a few points back to your comfort level***

We might need to exit before 8/7 depending on the state of stimulus negotiations

***Alternatively If you think there will be a surprise stimulus deal of more than  2 Trillion next week, then***

**SPY SELL 331C 8/7**

**SPY BUY 336C 8/7**

**You may ask  what is the opposite scenario that will propel the SPY to 400 this year ?**

2020-04-26 12:32:26,The Normie Playbook: A Terrifying SPY Update,"Earlier, I brought you [The Normie Playbook: An SPY Guide to the Days Ahead](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5zf9o/the_normie_playbook_an_spy_guide_to_the_days_ahead/), a play that I decided to throw $4000 at. As an aside, hindsight shows regardless of if you think the play is the right one or not, I made many mistakes executing it. First, I'll review. Then I'll look to next week.

# How I Put My Money In

[Buy High, Sell Low](https://preview.redd.it/bcesz1rwhqv41.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d6ce07a3df85f7a2a0c2e27e61079477bfc6199)

In reviewing the play I wanted to make, I decided early last week to create the plan and run with it. General belief being we would rise, then begin a descent. Not knowing when the descent would be, I wanted to average into the rise, putting progressively more of the money allocated to the play in as we rose.

**On 4/21** I FOMO'd in. This was a mistake (#1), and something done against my better judgement. I deployed 29% of the play's capital into this mistake, another mistake (#2). To exacerbate issues, I bought 5/30 puts, another mistake (#3), and wish these were 6/30 or 9/18 buys. In hindsight, I should have trusted my own DD, and waited for the rebound, also should have allocated no more than 15% in my initial buy, and the initial buys early on the way up should have been longer dated, finishing with the early dates.

**On 4/22** I had recognized the FOMO, gotten frustrated with own ineffectiveness, and wanted to be more mindful. I deployed another 22% across two buying windows. Neither perfect, but both fit the general play.

**On 4/23** I deployed all remaining cash, 49% of total play. These buys were mostly 9/18 puts, again in hindsight I made a mistake (#4) in the way I played the dates, one that exacerbates initial losses and will make decisions around modifying harder and more costly. There are a few other mistakes mixed in as well.

All told I deployed 29.34% on 4/21, another 21.56% on 4/22, and 49.1% on 4/23. I'm allocated 14.62% to 5/29, 45.14% to 6/30, and 40.25% to 9/18 puts.

# Terrifying, You Silly Normie! Now what?

Now I look ahead. I talked last time about each day being a coin flip, normalizing to the macro reality over time. I talked about a head and shoulder's pattern, and news being straw on a camel's back. I think the market is moving to a CRITICAL week. My belief is this week is either going to break us out of channel, sending us to test the 290-300 range and seeing me exit this play at a significant loss ... or ... we'll break channel lower, which I see as more likely, but not guaranteed. Let's look at some key aspects:

* [Housing Market Forebearances](https://www.ccn.com/the-housing-market-is-edging-dangerously-close-to-a-1-trillion-reckoning/) \- The housing market saw 500k loans go into forbearance in a week, a 9% jump, taking a total to 4.1 million people unable to pay their mortgage on about 1 trillion dollars in principal. Needless to say, not great.
* The Fed - They meet this week, negative interest rates are on the table, they're the bull saviors, and it's going to be an extremely interesting meeting. I expect an in-channel Monday. Tuesday we ride.
* [DIX, GEX, VIX](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7x0ub/dix_gex_and_vix_an_analysis_by_a_degenerate/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) \- Things are shaping up bearish. Terrific write up on these indicators. This is not a guarantee, but it's something.
* Kim Jong Un - No one want's further global destabilization, it's been nice for the past 6 months with North Korea mostly quiet. Adding fuel back to this region isn't a positive, things are also still inconclusive, but there's a ton of smoke.
* [Tech Earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4q8u6/daily_discussion_thread_for_april_20_2020/) \- Is this a buy the expectation sell the earnings setup? A HUGE percentage of the SPY's market cap reports earnings this week, and it's going to set support, or kick out a critical prop.
* Oil - Is anyone really surprised?
* General News - Disney closed until 2021? Georgia opening, Trump drives a bus over them? Sniffing clorox as treatment? Boeing backing out of merger? Upcoming GDP numbers, pending home sales numbers? The list goes on.

Bottom line, there's a lot of straw.

# Coiled like a spring in our channel

The market doesn't know which way it's going. I've made my bet, let's look:

[Extremely Tight](https://preview.redd.it/9y7gepbyhqv41.png?width=1187&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fd9b8ab2edbaaa1460440fd3cfb6f6186968fe4)

Look at the channel we entered on 4/9. We had a test up, a test down, and otherwise played between 276 and 284. The market is waiting, coiling, and you're going to see significant movement this week, so whatever direction you believe in, place your bets now. I think Monday stays in channel, the fun begins mid-week.

GOOG reports earnings on 4/28, they got out ahead and slashed their advertising budget by 50%. Hmm. A company driven by advertising, slashed their advertising in half. I don't expect a lot of positive vibes here. Expect Facebook to be in the same boat. Discover detailed [a nasty drop in consumer spending](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/24/discover-card-ceo-details-drop-in-spending-with-travel-down-99percent.html), I don't see that playing well for Apple or Tesla. Even Amazon, I'll be watching their business with curiosity. I think things shake out well for them long term, but I don't expect things to be all roses in the short term, I think they're going to have a hard time meeting the expectations the market's set for them.

My belief is the coiled market makes a run to the top of the channel (284-287), and collapses on itself like a dying star, exploding out to the downside, back to test the low 260's. I'm not much a fan of Forbes, but I will steal some graphics from [a recent article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2020/04/23/the-crash-of-2020-is-todays-oil-chart-tomorrows-sp-500-chart/#5e6addce73ec):

[Possibility 1](https://preview.redd.it/3qz9tf70iqv41.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=30ff3ba92aca172c5c55646afbae4984c16ff7c8)

[Possibility 2](https://preview.redd.it/56r3yfk1iqv41.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a26360c8279b60c7c1f1ae182b96e2c6d7e52f2)

My macro view fits the latter graph, as is likely obvious. But I recognize the possibility of a test downward, the bulls eating enough straw to keep the camel standing, and a firm rebound to the upside. I find it hard to see a third possibility where we immediately use the coil to push out of this channel to test 300, but while no visual for it, I accept it as a possible outcome.

I knew I wanted to run this play, and set out to do just that. I have regrets, could have deployed better, but have no qualms about detailing and making the play. It's going to be a crazy week.

# Updates

Hiring reduction ongoing, also a cap-ex reduction mostly due to no additional office build outs (real estate is going to take a beating all over).  No formal forward guidance, but mid teens decline on average, Youtube end of march deterioration is less yet still high single digits.  Early signs users are returning, but not clear how durable or monetizable, hasn't got worse start of Q2, but brand advertising continues to decline.

Q2 likely a lot worse, though no one will care if they can announce positive trends pointing to revenue returning.  To early to say, but I don't think they're in for a good year.  Might not matter for my play, there was enough wait and see optimism that I expect tech advertising to sustain for a while.  FED and more tomorrow, gonna ride it out, but I think we test upside again and try to break 291.5

**4/29 @ 6:30** : Today is going to be interesting.  I don't believe the FED cuts rates, I've come to the mind they'll say nothing, and say it with positivism.  I'm curious what guidance will be on QE taper, will they hold at 7.5b daily?  Anything below that could spook the market.  I don't believe earnings will be the catalyst I hoped, but we'll see.  With a lack of guidance, it's hard to see the true impacts, and that may not gain clarity until Q2 earnings, and even then, positive sentiment about Q3 would be enough.  Earnings just aren't going to be a leading indicator, especially sans guidance.

2850 is a big support for the S&P, set from 4/16's highs.  If we could crack 2850, we've got downside momentum to retest the 4/15 and 4/23 supports at 2755.  Unfortunately, in the near term, I think it's more likely we test the upward momentum, which will retest the strong resistance encountered at 2900, breaking through that gives us upside towards 3000.  cowpunk's chart above is the best bear case you can form from such a test, but there is danger here.  Continuing to set further highs and lower lows is generating additional support lanes making the near term bear case almost impossible towards any true retest of lows, barring a covid resurgence (which could happen via Georgia / Florida).  You could instead see theta own the day, 3000 prove a strong resistance and top, then a lot of sideways channel trading until the bleak macro economy takes hold and we start a slow, painful, drip by drip burn down to re-test lows.  I'll be waiting a bit more, but conscious this play is likely coming to an end.

4/30 @ 8:30 : The reality for me right now is I feel this play has failed.  I've turned my focus to how do I exit it.  To that end, I am stuck in limbo.  I will likely have something that goes up on Sunday talking about how I exit a failed play.  Currently, I'm not expecting to just fully sell, rather, I'll be looking at when to sell and what avoids extending losses, but also aims to minimize given upcoming market expectations.

4/30 @ 1:45 : I bought a very small \~$100 call position as a hedge given I'm holding this play through the weekend, 5/1 strike, will sell tomorrow at open regardless.  Hedging against after hours.

5/1 @ 9:30 : Call hedge did it's job, wanted protection against Amazon.  Speaking of which, more thoughts later, but glad they had a bearish earnings, even though it candidly wasn't all that terrible, the sentiment was unachievable.  Think we might test 288 early today, will see if anyone wants some badly OTM calls.  Would love to see us break 283 today.",363,0.94

Because of my risk tolerance, current available funds, and the amount I need to put in to make ok money, I’ll put at most 4K into this. It has to be a reliable stock trading for 15-40. The higher the price the better it has to be as a long term hold. As a cheap trial I was thinking of trying MFA. Although i think real estate REITs are fuk, id rather lose 250 because of a mistake than 4K. I was looking at BAC to actually do it. Reliable stock with YOY growth, large market cap, and federal reserve has helped them in past(2008 recession). What stocks do you all recommend in this price range, sorry I can’t afford GOOG or SPY. One day. Unless someone wants to loan me like 30k. 

TLDR: reliable long term stocks to use for the wheel under or at 40 currently.

2020-09-06 19:57:43,Mini DD for you gents,"In addition to my day job and gambling my earnings away with you tards, I have an online business bringing in some passive income through adsense. Once we move on from the onlyfans jokes, it's a general information site, bringing in about 4 figures monthly (5, on rare occasions), so it's not big by any means. I'm posting a screenshot from my adsense overview. You will notice earnings got crushed in April and May although views were little changed, but started recovering from there. What's interesting is that impression RPM has been rising. I also noticed that CPC has also been increasing. Basically, more people are bidding to advertise and revenue is up (even more than before CoVID). 

It's only one site, but I suspect the general pattern likely holds across the advertising world. GOOG got crushed after their last earning report, but I fully expect them to beat earnings when they report late October. Ditto for FB, and any other site that relies on ad revenue. 

Positions: GOOG 1800 and FB 300 for early November. For the uber retard, buy them as weeklies before earnings. You can sell half just before earnings to benefit from IV.

TLDR: fuck you, it's short enough.

Bullish scenario 🚀: 321.70-323.19 solid support. We held 323.58 today after a nice volume push. Now look for 324.93+ to hold, we actually had a nice volume push in one attempt today. Next stop is 325.75-326.93. If we bust through 327 with high volume. Next gap is straight to 332.59 


Bearish🩸: Look for 323.58-322.09 to break down towards 321.70 area (that was start of pullback on bloody Monday (7/13). 318.95-315.50 is tough. Unload/ scalp puts at that area. 

TLDR: Kang Gang between: 321.09-323.58-325.75



7/29 recap: came out strong. I know I was bearish yday (personally) however you should always have a game plan which is why I give both bullish and bearish scenarios. My bullish scenario from yday was pretty spot on. I never delete lines, but add and they all mean something (explained on 7/28 forecast post) 

Very very low volume morning. We opened right at one of my previous lines at 322.09 area and rode all the way to 323.58 and tested that area twice. Third time was a charm on high volume push. It came down and broke it right towards that key 323.18 level, bounced and back with high volume push. Same exact scenario with 324.93 area around 245pm est. 

Idk what tomm holds, more bullish than bearish. I really wanna see a high volume push past 327. We tried like 8 times last week.

2015-10-21 09:58:16,How much will mobile ad blocking affect Google's forward guidance? ($GOOG earnings 10/22),"Need some analysis, where's the faps to DD guy?

Mobile ads are like 37% of Google's revenues. Ad blocking affects said revenues, but this is more of a problem for the ad buyers, who directly pay Google. Google pays ad blockers to let their ads through.

I'm thinking in the worst case, Google's overhead costs simply are going up. Not that there is currently any material impact to the viability of their ads, or a change in sentiment yet amongst ad buyers (everyone else).

Anyway, none of this is positive for Google, as any minor blip in their mobile ad business will drastically affect their stock price. 

Thoughts? I took a small bullish position solely because of what happened last quarter (15% pop lol), but last quarter was before iOS 9 came out  hmm",5,0.86

2020-10-06 09:47:55,Gaming Bets - Piper survey notes gaming engagement boost among teens,"New 'FIFA' out this week on PC, consoles

Recap of the stories powering up or beating down video game stocks.

**NEW RELEASES:** This week's major new game release is Electronic Arts' (EA) soccer sim ""FIFA 21,"" out on October 9 for PlayStation 4 (SNE), Xbox One (MSFT), PC, and Nintendo Switch (NTDOY). Also out this week is ""Baldur's Gate 3,"" a role-playing game by Larian Studios. The game rolls out in early access on October 6 on Microsoft Windows, macOS (AAPL), and Google Stadia (GOOG).

**PIPER ENGAGEMENT NOTE:** Piper Sandler analyst Yung Kim said in a research note released earlier that the firm's semiannual survey of over 9,800 students indicated increased video games engagement across the board, with teens playing daily up to 31% versus 26% in the Spring 2020 survey. Kim said that a primary beneficiary was Activision Blizzard (ATVI), as after a summer of staying at home, teens chose ""Call of Duty: Warzone"" as the free-to-play title they play the most at 62%, up from 33% in the previous survey. The analyst sees the data as positive for console publishers Activision, EA, and Take-Two (TTWO), as well as mobile publishers Zynga (ZNGA) and Glu Mobile (GLUU).

**BARRON'S:** Max A. Cherney wrote [in a article for Barron's last week ](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-playstation-5-and-xbox-series-x-are-a-huge-deal-for-gamers-heres-what-it-means-for-investors-51601682443?mod=past_editions)that videogame stocks are expected to get another major boost. For the past six months, nothing has shown up on time but there's one major consumer event proceeding as scheduled next month, namely the launch of new videogame consoles from Microsoft and Sony, Cherney said, noting that pre-orders for the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 sold out in a matter of hours last month, despite their $500 price tags. Shares of Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, and Take-Two Interactive Software are each up at least 24% this year, but if history is any guide, there are more gains to come, the author added. Cherney also noted that the next-generation consoles arrive with games ""atop the entertainment pecking order,"" especially as many movie theaters are closed and Americans are still stuck at home. The author highlighted that, according to IDC, U.S. videogame sales are forecast to rise 19% this year to $45.6B, while the U.S. film box office peaked at $11.9B in 2018 and has grossed just $1.9B in 2020 so far.

2020-08-17 21:05:39,Analysis of Scion Asset Management 13-F Filing,"I am not one to typically follow or pay attention to the investing of those that consider themselves ""professionals"", but when it comes to the man, the myth, the legend, Dr. Michael Burry, I do. Recently, his fund, Scion Asset Management, filed it's 13-F Filing and there was some interesting information in it. (Bear in mind, some of these positions could be a few months old, however since I am focusing on the call options in his portfolio many of these positions would most likely be long-term and therefore would still be valid investments). Of note, Burry had 16 call positions which represented 71.19% of his portfolio. I would suspect that these are LEAP options (at least one year options) and not short-term call options, which clearly shows that he believes the economy has seen the worst of the coronavirus and is poised for a recovery. The reason I suspect Burry is invested in LEAP options is due to their tendency to be mispriced and cheaper than holding a higher priced stock like GOOG or BKNG long-term. They would offer far more upside than just holding the stock itself. We also know from history that Michael Burry is not a short-term investor and his ""Big Short"" positions, which were also derivatives, took over one year to profit. With that in mind here are the companies that made up the biggest positions in his call options: 

GOOG (36% of his portfolio)

FB (7%)

BKNG (6%)

GS (5%)

WDC (4%)

Various other companies made up his other positions which primarily consisted of energy, retail, gaming (casino) and financial companies. All these companies are in sectors which are market laggards currently, but would increase dramatically with a market recovery, hence his use of call options. From looking at his portfolio, it is evident Michael Burry is bullish on the market and believes that it is set to recover. He is clearly betting on higher interest rates in the future (financial stocks), higher energy prices (energy stocks), higher consumer spending (retail stocks), increased discretionary spending (casino/gaming/travel stocks), and overall increase in the dominant tech stocks (FB/GOOG). I think this is a solid portfolio and thesis. I am not one to argue with the legend and I will be following his lead into some of the stocks he has bought. Specifically GOOG, WYNN, LVS, JPM, BAC, GS calls.

2020-07-11 15:53:32,Bears Like Garbage So Have Some TWTR Puts,"Here's a current snapshot of an old fav chew-toy of mine... the enduring piece of shit that is Twitter... 

-Same 'ole toxic culture of shit-flinging monkeys, 5th column politics and subs bolstered by bots and spam. The social media platform voted most likely to disappear and almost no one would notice or care.

-A decade of piss-poor user growth while other social media platforms exploded. TWTR began hiding stagnant engagement early last year when they stopped reporting DAU's. MAU's are still flat-lined and USA subs are notably pitiful.

-Couldn't monetize Vine and gave that space away to other ventures for free. Couldn't monetize any major network streaming and lost bids to blue chip media for anything worth acquiring. Their market space is constantly encroached upon from below and above.

-Inexplicably climbing back to a 1 year high as it rides the DJI while its more economy attached EPS has been going down-down-down since 2019. They'll likely miss any Q2 earnings conservatively estimated above 0.06-0.08 EPS and if consensus reaches over 0.10, I'd be dancing with my pants off. Fewer analysts are even attempting to guess in these uncharted waters but some are anticipating a negative EPS.

-All social media ad revs *should* take a hit in Q2 and TWTR is one of the first platforms that companies will drop their ads from when business goes south. TWTR hasn't diversified their revs beyond ads and wallets were simply closed in Q2. Summer is also typically a slower time for online use and those still sheltering are burnt out on bad news.

-TWTR withheld Q2 guidance... which is bad in itself... but still implied bleak ad revs based on their taste of Covid at the end of Q1. They know. We know. They know we know. We know they know. Everyone knows the pandemic made Q2 ad revs horrible for TWTR.

-In typical fashion, TWTR just blasted some Icarus level ""paid sub"" hype to bolster their PPS before tragic earnings. No evidence of a single line of code written, a deployment anytime soon or any reason to think anyone will pay to zing each other. I think they oopsied and dropped it too early this time to prop the share price up all the way to Q2 reporting on 7/23.

-We *should* see the full blunt force trauma that the pandemic has had on similar companies this earnings season. Some added misery in the form of evictions, foreclosures, bankruptcies, re-closings, re-increase in unemployment and continued civil unrest may help cool the market. Probably not. The thing to watch for is if the other ad driven social media stocks missing their targets. TWTR breaking the bad news a full week before GOOG and FB makes me wonder if they'll try another pump 7/27-7/29. Conversely, I'm also wondering if they get a deserved downgrade next week.

-Cons are retail stock sentiment, duped bag holders, plenty of gas in the tank, creative accounting and blatant manipulation. MM's made me lmao when TWTR's worthless news drop on 7/8 pushed the share price up $4+ by 1pm without leaving a gap... so that volume was loaded and ready to fire IMHO... and still think they fired too early... but that's why I'm buying puts in the near $30's instead of the teens where TWTR's stock price should be based on their dog-shit fundamentals and guidance.

Now I'm not gehaaay enough to go full hard-on bear against this wholly un-Keynesian freak show of a market. I am however very Bear-Curious in betting that TWTR is currently over-bought AF and it's the best near forward looking play I got right now. So I hopped onboard with JUL31P@29 and then spread it out to AUG21P@28 because the algos were dishing out contracts at less than average decay for another few weeks to cover at only 20% premium. My best guess made, I felt last Friday was about the closest to earnings I could safely get on the boat before missing it.

If TWTR earnings reality starts to bake in next week like I think it will, then that's an ez 2x-3x banger. If a little luck and logic puts me in the money before earnings, then I hit the bullseye and should cash out. I might risk some cream past reporting if the EPS is over-estimated. If there's a decent drop and pay day, I'll honestly probably convert some gains into TWTR shares when they settle for a ride back up as we go into vaccine season. If it's not panning out then it hits my stop limit sell order before I get skunked and on to the next play. I won't pet a burning dog. I'm feeling pretty good this is a good play though. Unless it's not. Do your own DD and good luck.

Update: Quick FYI that I accepted the gift that was the TWTR account hacks on 7/16. Will evaluate re-entering on Friday. Sometimes all you need is chips on the table to win.",31,0.83

In a Kangaroo market like this I find myself looking to SPY for entry points on calls/puts and try not to go against the grain..

The technical picture suggesting a move to SPY 315 and a break above that would send SPY to 327.50  
\*But from there, the index could pull back to a low of around 300  
\*A break below 296.50 opens for significant downside  
and we would expect to see 273 within a few trading sessions

JPOW also said he sees a three stage economic path..  
stage 1 - the shutdown with sharp drop in activity - ends in June  
stage 2 - the bounceback with sharp increase in MoM economic data - ends in July  
stage 3 - we find that the economy is ""well short"" of pre-pandemic levels and go 'oh shit'

\*PPP funds running out in June for business that secured loans in April.. (PPP deadline extended to Aug 8th)  
\*Federal bans on evictions in federally assisted properties ends July 25  
\*Federal unemployment extra $600 ends July 31st

\*The markets will be prepping next month for the first release of 2nd quarter GDP which has been   
projected to drop anywhere from 30% to 50%  
prior trends..  
Q2 2019: +2.0%  
Q3 2019: +2.1%  
Q4 2019: +2.1%  
Q1 2020: -5.0%

\*The HEROES Act, if passed by the senate, could include..  
second round of stimulus checks  
extension of the $600 increase in unemployment

What to expect as banks report earnings:  
\-expect another big hit to earnings as they set aside more money to cover loan losses  
\-a boost in fee income from elevated trading activity  
\-Banks not allowed to raise dividends or perform share buy-backs through Q3 2020  
\*Wells Fargo & Co. WFC appears at greatest risk for a dividend cut among the “big six” U.S. banks

\*analysis of the government data found that just over 554,000 small businesses who got PPP funds   
reported retaining zero jobs - raising concerns about how many will be eligible for forgiveness in the future

\*Consumer borrowing fell dropped BIGLY in April, less in May, and even less in June.. But use of consumer credit is down YoY for each month of Q2  
\*Revolving credit, like credit cards, declined at a nearly 29% clip in May. In April, revolving credit shrank by a record 65% as people paid down debt.  
\*For companies that rely on transaction volume and late fees for revenue generation.. this will hurt Q2 earnings (MA, V, etc.)

\*Yet nonrevolving credit, typically auto and student loans, actually rose 2.3%. Auto sales rebounded   
during the month (ALLY CVNA)

\*As Bloomberg cautions, the pace of recent Chinese gains matches the market’s melt-up that started in the final weeks of 2014.. before a huge crash in SHCOMP.. 

\*Global restaurant traffic data via OpenTable shows little improvement in late June  
OpenTable recently warned that 25% of all U.S. restaurants would never reopen

Energy: A Deloitte analysis has found that almost a third of U.S. shale producers are technically insolvent with crude at $35 a barrel.  
Analysts predict 250 oil/gas/shale may go bankrupt with companies now filing for bankruptcy at the fastest pace since 2009

(COF) Capital One said nearly three-quarters of its $6.24 billion exposure to the oil and gas industry   
lies with companies responsible for exploration and production.

(BAM) Broofield Asset Management tenants will go bankrupt.. but BAM has requested forbearance  
on the loans BAM owes for 12-months..

\-------

\*of course, any news on PPP-extension, more unemployment checks, or a vaccine could always cause a rally

2020-08-25 14:09:08,Daily Market and Options Summary for Aug-25-2020,"**Context -**

The S&P 500 (+0.4%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.8%) rose to record highs today. The market found continued support in the mega-caps following a disappointing consumer confidence report.

Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index dropped to 84.8 in August (consensus 93.0) from 91.7 in July for its lowest reading since May 2014.

Presumably, there were some concerns that the decline in consumer confidence would translate to less consumer spending, absent another round of fiscal stimulus. In addition, the report overshadowed new home sales showing a marked increase of 13.9% m/m in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 901,000 (consensus 787,000).

Amazon (AMZN 3346.49, +39.03, +1.2%), Facebook (FB 280.82, +9.43, +3.5%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1608.22, +20.02, +1.3%), which have performed well throughout the pandemic, posted strong gains after a slow start. Apple (AAPL 499.30, -4.13, -0.8%) was a notable exception.

In key stock news, Salesforce (CRM 216.05, +7.59, +3.6%), Amgen (AMGN 248.22, +12.65, +5.4%), and Honeywell (HON 164.53, +5.16, +3.2%) will replace Exxon Mobil (XOM 40.89, -1.33, -3.2%), Pfizer (PFE 38.41, -0.43, -1.1%), and Raytheon Technologies (RTX 60.95, -0.93, -1.5%) in the Dow 30 average prior to the open on Aug. 31.

The change was enacted to account for Apple's 4:1 stock split, as its lower price would reduce the price-weighted Dow's exposure to the technology sector.

The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 93.01. WTI crude futures rose 1.7%, or $0.72, to $43.33/bbl.

Investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for July and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.

2020-05-19 11:24:42,CANNABIS STOCKS OPPORTUNITY,"Canadian Cannabis Industry stocks look like they turned the corner on proving their profitability & viability & are ready to go back up to their full potentials.

Adult Recreational Sales of Cannabis 2.0 have gone up due to hoarding like toilet paper & sales will keep growing during self isolation rules in Canada.

Cannabis 2.0 & derivatives are legal in Canada & the government is the biggest distributor & they also retail too. You can buy it online, at a store or get it delivered. They definitely will be expanding Cannabis Sales for taxes for all the Covid19 Aid & Cash they are giving to citizens & businesses.

Here's the Canadian Cannabis Stocks trading on the TSX, USA (NYSE & Nasdaq) & some European exchanges:

* **Aurora Cannabis Inc (ACB)**
* **Aphria Inc. (APHA)**
* **Canopy Growth Corporation (CGC / WEED)**
* **Cronos Group Inc (CRON)**
* **HEXO Corp (HEXO)**
* **OrganiGram Holdings Inc. (OGI)**
* **Tilray Inc (TLRY - not on TSX)**
* **Village Farms International, Inc. (VFF)**

They all are near their 52 week lows & are Short Squeeze candidates. ACB popped a bit since their last Q3 May 14 ER but there's still lots of room to go up.  HEXO is next on June 11.

They're stocks are all very volatile right now because they just turned the corner & should reach their full potential again but they've been heavily shorted for the past year.

Investors must think ACB is the leader of the Cannabis Industry because when it's stock makes large moves, up or down, it pulls the rest with it.

During the Industry Shakeout Stage, there will be lots of M&A & buyouts, so buckle up your seat belts because the wild ride is not over yet.

Past Big Stock Pick winners that I posted about in the past before their run up:

AMD, ATVI, BABA, FB, GOOG, LOGI, LULU, MU, NVDA, PYPL, STX, TSLA, TWTR

Good luck & always do your Due Diligence before investing.

""We do think that it will look to expand into the U.S. but not until federal legality is more clear.""

South Korea’s sovereign-wealth fund disclosed Monday that it had acquired a chunk of Aurora stock. Switzerland’s central bank also recently boosted its Aurora holdings.

**U.S. cannabis companies say legalization would be an economic savior (April 27, 2020):**

Cannabis is a revenue generator — and therefore, a tax generator, adds Boris Jordan, executive chairman for U.S.-based Curaleaf. “One of the programs by the federal government right after the Great Depression was to focus on tax revenue generation,” Jordan tells *CNBC.* “They lifted prohibition on alcohol and therefore started to tax it — and it became a major revenue generator for both the federal and the local governments around the country.”

**Governments earned $186M in pot taxes in 5.5 months of legalization on Oct 17, 2018: StatsCan (Jun 19, 2019):**

“My approach is to make sure that the taxation of cannabis is consistent with the goal of keeping cannabis out of the hands of kids and out of the black market,” federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau told the House of Commons last February \[2019\]. “That means keeping the taxes low so we can actually get rid of the criminals in the system.”

They've made a lot of progress. Everyone will prefer the competitively priced Cannabis 2.0 products over the black market stuff. They're all sealed with ingredient & THC & CBD strength. Drug Dealers are Covid19 Super Spreaders. I'll stick to government sealed & certified stuff. After all, they're helping everyone, so I'll help me, help us through more taxes. ;)

Honestly, all the unlicensed producers & retailers have been shut down due to even more potential fines & even criminal charges due to Covid19 Rules, while legal ones are all open as ""essential"" businesses.

# Study: Cannabis Could Prevent COVID-19 Infections (May 16, 2020):

There's lots of potential with Tobacco & Alcohol cross-over products. There will be deals with Biotech too, if not already. Possibly even in clean energy too with Hemp Biofuel.

There's even some word about a possible Covid19 Vaccine or preventative products based on Cannabis.

Novel combinations of cannabinoids “may become a useful addition to the treatment of COVID-19,” the researchers wrote. “They may also be used to develop additional easy-to-use preventative strategies such as mouth wash and throat gargle products that may be tested for their potential to decrease viral entry via the oral cavity and may be used both in clinical practice and at-home treatment.”

In experiments with 3D human cell cultures mimicking various diseases, certain high CBD cannabis strains—developed by the researchers labs, in no relation to the cannabis available in legal and recreational markets in Canada or the US—demonstrated abilities to shut down coronavirus’s favorite “pathway: a receptor called ACE2.

**“Our work could have a huge influence — there aren’t many drugs that have the potential of reducing infection by 70 to 80 per cent”.**

At the University of Lethbridge, Drs. Igor and Olga Kovalchuk, of the Plant Biotechnology Laboratory, are studying how medical cannabis cultivars helps combat symptoms of the COVID-19 virus.

**Quarantined Americans embrace cannabis, reshaping an industry (May 22, 2020):**

A lot of the increase has come from regular users, especially millennials, Brightfield’s data show. Among people who’ve used cannabis in the last year, 34 per cent said in late March that they’re using it more frequently, and 16 per cent say they’re using higher doses or doing longer sessions.

For millennials, those numbers are higher: 41 per cent use more frequently, and 20 per cent use higher doses.

Not all the increase in sales is for recreational use. Curaleaf said it’s also witnessed an increase in patients and older clientele.

“A lot of the users coming into the sector now are people who never used before,” said Curaleaf’s Jordan. Many of them are over 60 “and asking for pain relief, sleep aids, anxiety relief -- and it’s mostly not smokable.”

# “Think about where cannabis was a few years ago -- illegal,” said Chris Melillo, Curaleaf’s senior vice president of retail. “And now we’re essential.”

Shares of Village Farms International (NASDAQ: VFF) were soaring 22.6% as of 3:50 p.m. EDT on Friday. The cannabis and greenhouse produce company didn't announce any news of its own, but there were several other developments that were likely behind Village Farms' big gain.

One potential factor for the Village Farms' jump was Statistics Canada's release Friday morning of data showing that cannabis sales in Canada skyrocketed in March. Also, results from a study were announced on Thursday that found that some cannabis strains could help prevent the novel coronavirus from entering host cells. In addition, Bank of America reinstated coverage on big cannabis producer Canopy Growth (NYSE: CGC) with a buy rating, which could be viewed as a positive sign for the entire Canadian cannabis industry.

2020-06-29 13:36:00,Being long CLDR seems like an honorable enough way to lose money. DD,"#Thesis: Kind of a stale company which is lagging behind its competitors, *buy it on valuation alone*. 

We also have a new CEO coming in for the last 6 months providing some tail upside and also some possible downside(net-net, a minor positive)

Cloudera made money by creating solutions for Hadoop, which customers are moving away from. So instead, Cloudera is moving toward leveraging AWS, MSFT, GOOG's cloud infrastructure and building tools on top of it to pivot their existing client base toward products that actually work. Whether this succeeds or fails will remain to be seen. 

The company also has a pretty significant consulting arm which generates around 10% of their sales, and of course is involved in selling the company's products. Kinda like IBM or other shit companies. The difference is that Cloudera is actually growing their subscription revenue at the clip of 20% in 2020 compared to these others which just decline. (This consulting arm is not a profit center, but exists to drive subscription revenue)

My personal belief working in this industry: You can deliver a kinda shit solution and get an A+ because the customers are so hungry to be able to actually look at their data and there is a shortage of the relevant expertise. We can still have a turnaround story, and Cloudera is at the end of the day a young company. It's not quite ""IBM selling mainframes in 2020"" just yet. 

OK so let's take a look at some valuation metrics around this here company:

P/S: 5x

Subscription Sales FY 2020: 825M - 875M (doubled since 2 years prior, also had doubled 2 years prior before that, reflecting consistent sales growth. Of course the growth going forward is NOT gonna be consistent, it is gonna Fuck.You.In.The.Ass.jpeg. Don't say I didn't warn you).

Gross margin: Around 85% for their subscription revenue (read: pretty fuckin' good) and not going down.

In other words we have a stock trading around 7x gross profit -- that's pretty low... the single relevant question revolves around how much reinvestment is necessary to preserve that gross profit? Ballpark I'd say around 1/3, making this a stock that trades around 10x steady state earnings... pretty good.


Moral of this story: If you're impressed by this laundry list of numbers and some words, then be long with me on CLDR and lose some money with honor. I will print out a sticker for you that says 'value investor like Warry Buffy' and we can share a few drinks at the autism convention. 

NOW --- the most important thing. If this stock hits $18, and I think it will, then unless the fundamentals have moved significantly since then, I am prolly going to sell. What we're seeing now is something like a bear #market rally and I'm happy to walk away with a 40% return.",5,0.65

2020-08-01 11:45:37,This Weeks Market News & Events for Retards (07/27-07/31),"&#x200B;

US initial jobless claims rose for a second straight week as 1.4 million Americans applied for initial jobless benefits, and also marked the 19th straight week where over a million people filed for unemployment. Continuing claims rose by 867K leaving us with an “official” total of more than 17 million unemployed. The most recent count of US Job openings was performed back in May, and indicated that there were only about 5.4 million job openings in America(1). 

Despite having 4 whole fucking months to plan for this shit, Congress fucked off for 3 months then took their normally planned recess in the beginning of July while families and America were burning, and were unable to rush their way through negotiations for another Stimulus bill before the additional $600 in unemployment benefits were cut off for 17 million Americans. Many Americans and families are now in the dark waiting for Congress to get their shit together and make a decision on unemployment benefits and come to agreement over another stimulus package. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer shot down an offer from Republicans to extend the $600 benefits for one week while they continue to negotiate, because Democrats wanted a “Comprehensive bill”. To the credit of the Democrats, back in May they developed a proposal for a second stimulus known as the HEROES act which was worth 3 trillion dollars which would keep the extra $600 unemployment benefits in place for those receiving UI. Republicans wanting to reduce spending for the second stimulus package proposed the HEALS act on July 27th which is a a trillion dollar proposal, and would reduce the extended unemployment benefits to $200 a week.(2) US chief of Staff Mark Meadows reports that “We are nowhere close to a deal” which came as a surprise to not a single fucking soul on this planet. 

After a 5% GDP contraction in the first quarter of this year, the US suffered it’s greatest GDP contraction ever for the 2nd quarter with a contraction of 32.9%. This of course was largely due to Stay at home orders that had been implemented across the country, and a slow reopening with many states rolling back reopening measures. The services industry took a majority of the hit as travel, tourism, and dining continues to suffer from dismal demand. Overall spending on services dropped by 43%. Retail and manufactures inventories continue to also reached their biggest decline on record (4). Exports & imports also dropped greater than 50% as international trade declined as well. (5) Economists and analysts are predicting that this could be the economic bottom and we are primed for a rebound in Q3 of 2020. Of course that is all dependent on whether businesses are allowed to reopen or forced to remain shuttered.  

In other news, $AAPL, $FB, $GOOG, $AMZN found themselves testifying virtually on Capital Hill this week while congress drilled them about the size and power of their companies. This all stems from an antitrust investigation(3) that began a year ago to look into the power and practices of these tech giants and determine if they have been participating in predatory and hostile business tactics to maintain dominance and influence in their industry. The investigation has the potential to impose stricter regulations on tech giants to reduce their power and influence. Despite all the grandstanding, most of Tech with the exception of $GOOG smashed their earnings after the bell while their CEOs were still testifying. Despite facing an advertising boycott $FB hit an all time high of $257 raising 8% on Friday, $AAPL announced a 4-1 stock split to bring down their share price to around $125 a share making it more accessible for retail investors, $AAPL ended up 10% at $425. $GOOG beat their earnings but reported a decline in business revenue for their first time ever, and ended the trading session down 3% @ $1482.

California Pizza Kitchen joined the rising number of businesses to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Mall brands especially continue to be hit hard by Covid as major malls across the country remain closed. Brook Brothers and Lucky brands also joined California Pizza Kitchen in filing for bankruptcy in July. It seems the only hope retailers have to return to full capacity lies in the release of a vaccine. After hacking multiple institutions and labs working on covid vaccines in the US & UK, Russia plans on registering their vaccine with regulators and to start mass vaccinations in October. Although the speed at which is was developed has caused concern about its safety. $MRNA started phase 3 clinical trials on July 27th and is expected to enroll 30K participants. Although $MRNA is seen as the current American leader in the race for a Vaccine, rival Pfizer $PFE which is believed to have more resources available for vaccine development is catching up and announced they will begin phase 3 trials and are also looking to enroll up to 30K participants. Meanwhile $AZN has already agreed to supply 400 Million doses of their vaccine when it is developed to the US & UK and has begun to scale up manufacturing capacity despite the risk that their vaccine has yet to fully complete trials and be proven as effective. Though at this point, the “when” seems to be much more important than the “who” when it comes to a Covid vaccine.

2020-04-29 12:22:28,TSLA - Put and Call at Same Time,"I'm almost certain TSLA is going up, but I'm buying both PUTs and Calls.

* $2500 in calls - 500% profit chance, 100% loss chance
* $2500 in puts - 500% profit chance, 100% loss chance

No matter what, I win? I just did this with GOOG yesterday before earnings and came on top with my options. Anyone see any issues with this logic? Let me know before I follow through.

EDIT: I don't really mean 500%, I don't want to edit the numbers so you guys can see the retardation. But I meant basically anything over 101% would put me in a win position.",7,0.63
2019-07-21 19:21:26,How Google can make a couple billion overnight,"Netflix is in a very fragile state right now, kind of like me since my wife left, due to missing subscriber growth targets.

So I'm thinking, Google can make an absolute killing by buying puts on Netflix and then removing Netflix from the app store.

This tanks the price because most signups probably come from mobile devices based on an article that was probably written by a bot that I just skimmed. Plus, android users are probably 50% of Netflix's user base because there are two main mobile OSs (iOS and Android) so 1/2 = 50%. 

So overnight, Netflix loses access to 50% of new subscribers. 

But then, Google can take it a step further. Like in the time when Apple put that bon jovi song on everyone's iPod, or Amazon deleted a bunch of eBooks off people's kindles, Google can delete the Netflix app from everyone's android device citing ""security concerns"". (Security of Google's bottom line)

At this point, Google just needs to load up on OTM puts, ranging from FDs to LEAPS, and strikes as far as 40% OTM.

Anyways, so now you got all these people panicking about how Netflix is going under and being removed / possibly malware. Once this hysterectomy sets in, Google turns around, closes the puts, and buys a ton of calls and reinstates Netflix.

Maybe Google even force reinstalls Netflix on a bunch of android / iOS users (idk if they can hack apple and install apps but I'm just assuming they can)

So basically, Google makes a ton of money on this and dipshits who write options get screwed. Google makes a couple billion overnight and EPS for that quarter goes through the roof.

If anyone has Satya Nadella's contact info, please pass it on so I can tell him about this great plan. I'll give you a cut of the massive paycheck he cuts to me for this consulting work as I generate billions in earnings for Google.

Oh yeah, one issue is potential litigation and anti-trust action, but that won't happen for at least 1-2 quarters after the earnings come out, so it doesn't matter.",456,0.95
2020-03-26 15:29:19,Assume for a moment the stock market was not in a bubble before,"Assume for a moment that recent technological advancements in cloud, AI, automation, etc has created a lot of excitement about the future and it wasn't just a bubble and rather good ol' exuberance, maybe a little excessive but not dangerously so.   Also, don't forget the Donald's  deregulation.   Yeah it's dangerous and stupid for the planet, but \*\*\*\* me, it really lets the capitalism roar loudly.    Tragedy of the commons can take awhile to bite you in the ass, especially at a global scale.

Ok, so the virus comes along and says ""look, any business that relies on human contact is totally \*\*\*\*ed.""   So bang, market comes crashing down, because there are a lot of tickers in the S&P that do rely on human contact.  You know, gaming / retail / restaurants -  MGM, WYNN, DRI, ULTA, HD, and yeah maybe even the health ones, but they have always been in a precarious spot - LNC, UHS, UNM.   DIS too got hit, but something tells me they will weather this.   They're more than just a bunch of resorts.

But those aside, really, if we assume the market was not really in a bubble before but merely a reflection of a society becoming wealthier due to tech and money was more free to do its thing.  Also, we see approval numbers come out that show Donald is actually pretty popular with his handling of the virus.

Why shouldn't the market take off like a rocket?  Yeah, those tickers above I think are still \*\*\*\*ed, but everything else should do OK.   Besides, they were stupid businesses anyway and did very little for over all social productivity.  They were just mostly expensive, time consuming entertainment and social waste- what does that really do anyways?

We may have to restructure our economy so that we're all more efficient in how we become entertained, but this actually may be a good thing, and reason to be optimistic about the future.

I'm talking MSFT, AMZN, GOOG(L), AAPL, NFLX, INTC, T, VZ, NVDA, NFLX, ADBE,  etc.  XLK is a reasonable tracker here.

I'm not saying buy calls, I'm just saying that the reports of death may have been exaggerated and Social distancing is not necessarily a bad thing.   Lots of very very productive people work and learn from home.

And then, of course let's not forget - the money machines go BRRRR \* 10\^infinity.
