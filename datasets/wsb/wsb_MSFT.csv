2021-01-27 03:42:12,Stock Market News for Today | MSFT / AMD / BYND / SBUX / TLRY & Other Stock Market News [01-27],"**Stocks finish in the red while Microsoft crushes earnings in after hours. The short squeeze continues to crush short sellers while EVs & Hydrogen are on the move. Let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw all 3 major indexes finish the day down, with both the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/PspccJG) and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/rwB8b2z) losing .07% while the [SP500](https://ibb.co/qg7hSBb) dropped by .15% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/NYVtHtF) remained pretty flat in a build-up day for today as the stock market is going to be hit with numerous economic data and big earnings reports from [Apple](https://ibb.co/kqJ38mj) which is expected to have their first $100B quarter, Boeing, Facebook, Tesla & many others.

We saw almost 60% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/7kH7Zjv) advancing with some companies dropping below the 50-day moving average as only 4 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/x6pRR2P) finished in the green, with Communications & Real Estate gaining more than 1% while Energy was the biggest laggard dropping more than 2% despite being the leader of the bunch in the early morning.

We also saw large-cap growth [companies](https://ibb.co/3svx5md) leading the way while the rest of the groups were lagging behind as you can also see in the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/S3ChnhR) from yesterday, with most of the small & mid-caps losing ground while the FAANG, Tesla, Microsoft and some other big companies were keeping the markets steady.

In terms of economic data, we saw the November housing price [index](https://ibb.co/dG3FNCJ) coming in as expected with a 11% increase y/y, which was also supported by the Shiller [Index](https://ibb.co/5ndWrBz) which indicated a 9.5% increase over last year, the biggest increase we have seen in this economic data in more than 6 years.

We also saw the January [consumer](https://ibb.co/vxdYwYy) confidence coming in better than expected at 89.3 with most of the increase coming from the expectations that consumers have of things getting better in the near future as the re-opening goes along.

Meanwhile the Richmond FED manufacturing [survey](https://ibb.co/F6PzgFL) came in at 14, lower than the 19 we saw last month as we saw a decrease in shipments, capacity utilization & volume of new orders.

In some other stock market news, we saw a lot of highly shorted stocks rise yet againüöÄüöÄüöÄ, with the forbidden one rose by more than 90% for the day and continuing with an additional 120% in after hours, while [Beyond Meat](https://ibb.co/rtQccJB) rose by 33% in early morning after announcing a partnership with [PepsiCo](https://ibb.co/wRL5s66) which is one of the biggest food companies in the world, as they will develop snack & beverage products that are plant-based.

We also saw the pot stocks rise again, with [Tilray](https://ibb.co/wpZGYPD) üöÄ leading the way after some national agencies from France tagged them to supply products for experiments in France. Tilray has been on a huge run since the Aphria merger news, and the company still has a lot of upside potential left especially if the Biden administration manages to push some sort of legislation, even if it isn‚Äôt a full-legalization in the US.

The same hopes of future help from the current administration were also seen in the EV & Hydrogen [sectors](https://ibb.co/3TwmFNC), with a lot of names like WorkHorse, Lordstown, Nikola & many others rising significantly yesterday

Some big companies also reported yesterday, as we saw General Electric [beating](https://ibb.co/0jpB660) most of the estimates in early morning and giving better than expected guidance on future free cash flow, which is a very big thing for a dividend paying company which has been struggling in the past years, while [JNJ](https://ibb.co/vQwJh52) also beat expectations and guided for even better revenues and earnings for next year as they are expecting vaccine results by next week, which could be huge for the hole stock market.

We also received a couple of big earnings reports in after hours, with [Starbucks](https://ibb.co/x3jzxHb) reporting pretty much as expected, but this high valuations for the stocks don‚Äôt really allow for OK quarters, everything needs to be exceptional for the most of the stocks to grow into these big valuations.

On the other hand, we saw [Microsoft](https://ibb.co/z8htnJC) crushing expectations, beating by almost $0.40 and a beat of more than $2.5B on revenues hitting over $40B in revenues for the first time due to the big demand in cloud revenues with Azure growing revenues by 50%, even better than the 48% in the last quarter. Microsoft also [guided](https://ibb.co/FYkGRSw) for upside in the next quarter, as this was a sleeping giant just like most of the big FAANG names which were underperformers for the better part of the end of 2020.

Meanwhile the other big tech name that reported was [AMD](https://ibb.co/fnB4Zvw), which also beat expectations due to big growth in all-areas of their business. I‚Äôll be making a Due Diligence in AMD probably later today as I really want to see what growth they have ahead as they continue to battle with Intel

So, let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/ZhwtrgB) are mixed, with the Nasdaq leading the way as we also await MBA mortgage applications in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/3yGpYRj), but mostly expect to see what the FED announces later in the day, as they end the two-day meeting and it is very likely Powell & The FED will keep the interest rates close to 0% and remain very dovish, probably continuing the monthly $120B assets purchase program for the foreseeable future.

2021-01-25 04:56:34,Stock Market News for Today | PLTR / GM / AAPL / TSLA / FB / MSFT & Other Stock Market News [01-25],"**Stocks close out the week with big gains, as Big Tech comes back in flavor. The earnings frenzy starts with Apple, Tesla, Facebook & Microsoft reporting. GameStop, GM & Ford spiked last week, let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of Friday as we saw most of the stock market giving up some of the big gains of the week, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/ZxdGSkm) losing .30% & the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/MRn5Q40) Industrial dropping 179 points while the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/F3wm2d8) barely managed to post a small gain for the day as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/JRkwsZn) ticking up a little but finishing under 22 for the week, with the Nasdaq gaining 4.2% in the short week the SP500 rising 1.9% and the Dow Jones posting a .6% gain.

About 55% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/hFF1hSm) were advancing on below average volume as the number of companies moving above the moving averages still remains very high. We only saw 3 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/pPJpQCk) posting small gains for the day while the biggest losers were the value play in Financials, Energy and Industrials, all losing more than .50%

For the week we saw communications outperform with a big spike after Netflix reported earnings, while Energy had more than one ugly day dropping big on Monday, Thursday and Friday.

Small-caps faired better to close out the [week](https://ibb.co/y0C39gJ), with all 3 groups posting gains of more than 1.5% while Large-Cap Value companies underperformed losing more than 2.5% for the week, as Growth Companies & Especially the big-caps finally outperformed this week, gaining 2.3%.

Here is the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/MnWSRV4), which was a pretty mixed bag, with Apple posting a big gain ahead of the earnings report while the other big tech companies also posted small-gains. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/BfYRHWS) though, we saw huge gains in most of the big tech names with all the FAANG names and Microsoft gaining more than 5% for the week, while Banks alongside Oil & Gas companies were the biggest losers

We also got some economic data on Friday as existing home [sales](https://ibb.co/KWxRW9m) rose again while the inventory is still at all time-lows of under 2 months of supply while the January [PMI](https://ibb.co/x54dqCy) current read came in at 58, way above the 55.5 expected and 55.3 in the previous read as both the Services and Manufacturing PMI saw a spike of more than 2 points

This week we also start the [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/2nsRvBx) frenzy, with AMD which might benefit from Intel‚Äôs drop last week, Microsoft & Starbucks reporting after Tuesday‚Äôs close as JNJ might also give some updates regarding their vaccine, while big value companies like Boeing, AT&T & Caterpillar report before the open on Wednesday & Friday. We also have some of the big tech names reporting on the same day, with Apple which is expected to have their first $100B quarter, Tesla & Facebook reporting after Wednesday‚Äôs close which might be a bigger volatility moment for the market depending on how the results come in.

In terms of economic [data](https://ibb.co/Fx6TWyw), we start off [today](https://ibb.co/4K4DDvp) with the Dallas FED Manufacturing survey but the most interesting ones are on Thursday & Friday, while we also wait to see what the FED announces in terms keeping the rates low & the money printer going with asset buying on Wednesday.

In some other stock market, we saw [Palantir](https://ibb.co/zV2vxft) soar on Friday, rising more than 25% to break the $30 levels after they updated their Demo Day scheduled for tomorrow. It‚Äôs expected that they will reveal the latest developments in their big software platforms and also reveal [new](https://ibb.co/swYH61R) software platforms that will continue to help the company grow such as SDDI, Low-Code/No-Code and other modular strategy software.

We also saw [Ford](https://ibb.co/D8cmmZn) soaring again, as the company is having the best monthly performance in more than 10 years and spiked more than 6% after JP Morgan upgraded the company based on their new product line which is what I‚Äôve been saying about the company in some months now. Tesla is going to face serious competition in the next decade with all the other car manufactures pushing harder and harder into the EV world, with some of the most popular cars out there like the F150, the Bronco and other models joining the sector that will continue to improve and might actually become a good alternative to Tesla‚Äôs models. It‚Äôs the same with others like [GM](https://ibb.co/42G3ttK) which might be a good catch-up play compared to Tesla. By the way‚Ä¶ [GM](https://ibb.co/vPwbPCs) is outperforming Tesla recently based on their developments in the EV & self-driving sector.

Meanwhile, [GME](https://ibb.co/bXYsj4k) had a wild day on Friday, gaining more than 50% despite being even higher as the battle between WSB & the shorts continues, with this move making Citron‚Äôs Left deciding to avoid further talks about the company probably in an attempt to avoid future attention at the GameStop short squeeze. Short Squeeze has seen a big rise in terms of [search](https://ibb.co/qn51BPH) interest after these latest moves in the GameStop stock and might even put more pressure on the bears, as retail investors might run up this stock even more.

So, guys, this week might bring a lot of volatility depending on many of the important events we have. Earnings seasons & especially big tech results will be important to justify these high multiples most of the tech names have received, while we also have to see how the GDP comes in, as it is expected to have seen a 4% growth for the 4th quarter while the FED is under pressure to keep the money printer on and the rates low, if not, or if there is any doubt in their commitments and also some numbers come in worse than expected we might see the long-awaited correction/pullback. But I don‚Äôt think numbers or the FED are going to disappoint really, but that doesn‚Äôt exclude the possibility of the pullback‚Ä¶ keep investing safely & have some money available to buy the dips if they appear, use them as a buying opportunity, not a panic sell.

So, let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/929L2rz) are pointing to a very good open, with the Nasdaq leading the way up almost 1%

I have been at this trading game for a while, mostly looking at a confluence of technical analysis and sometimes fundamentals.

It has since come to my attention the MSFT will be giving some free money in the next few weeks. Now I know that details doesn't matter here, so I will keep it short.

Please take a look at the daily chart and observe that this company is having a breakout on the 217 level. It is also confirmed with an upward pinbar and some larger than usual volumes. This along with all the other techs looking ready for another run up is enough to have me quite excited :)

Now I know this is a boomer stock, but remember free money is free money. This will probably not lead to an early retirement, but my guess is that you could at least double your money on a C230 or C240 expiring 22/01/2021.

2020-12-10 08:24:34,MSFT low IV w/ earnings in 2 months,"Hello  

I write to remind you of an old friend of the sub, Mr. Satya Nutella.   

MSFT has been sideways ever since they tried to acquire a clock company, but MSFT is still MSFT, and azure is still azure. ER will be late Jan/early Feb, and IV is low rn.  

Post-ER ATM Jan MSFT calls have IV around 30%, w/ break even around $220. IV on LEAPS is also low.  I'm thinking there might be IV expansion heading into earnings, if the whole market goes up MSFT could just ride the wave, or third MSFT just bounces around alot btw 205-215 and if it randomly rises then cool. AFAIK opportunities for downside are basically a market crash/tech dip or random unexpected bad news for MSFT, which is just true for everything. For comparison on IV pre earnings in the current market, I'm looking at something like Oracle, a huge boring company that has ER tonight and IV on ATM options of 110%. Maybe there's some unique reason Oracle has high IV, but I don't know it.   

**TL;DR**: Positions: 5 MSFT 215c 2/19/2021; 8 MSFT 210c 1/21/2022; 8 MSFT -235c 12/11/2020; 2 BA 295c 1/21/22; 2 BA -300c 12/11/2020",34,0.9
2020-10-12 10:35:55,GME - Here is how much the MSFT deal is worth.,"Michael Pachter, of Wedbush, detailed how this works:

For example, if a customer signs up for the $15 monthly Xbox Game Pass Ultimate at a GameStop store, we would expect GameStop to receive $1.50 or so from that monthly revenue stream for as long as the customer continues to subscribe. If instead, the customer signs up for Xbox All Access for $35/month, GameStop would share $3.50 per month for 24 months.

Further:

That's right. In years 3 and 4 combined, if just 5 million customers extend the subscription for two years, GameStop makes $180 million in incremental profit with zero cost involved. That's nearly a quarter of GameStop's current market cap in recurring income at 100% margin!",106,0.93

2021-02-16 07:32:02,"The SEC Just posted the new numbers for Failure to Deliver. Guess What, GME is failing to deliver every day.","Hey 'Tards,

The  New Failure to deliver data is JUST OUT from the SEC.  Here is a simple pivot table.   It's still failing to deliver EVERY DAY.  I'm sure people will analyze this better than me.   But I wanted to get this out to everyone ASAP.

Edit: Failure to deliver is how many shares were not accounted for at the end of the day.  GME has been failing to deliver in some capacity for weeks now.  This data is posted by the SEC Freedom of  Information Act (FOIA).  It is only posted every two weeks, for the previous two weeks.  But this is the most recent data that everyone has been waiting on.

From the SEC regarding this data

>""The   figure is not a daily amount of fails, but a combined figure that  includes both new fails on the reporting day as well as existing fails.    In other words, these numbers reflect aggregate fails as of a specific    point in time, and may have little or no relationship to yesterday's    aggregate fails.""

&#x200B;

SEC FOIA Site: [https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)

Data File: [https://www.sec.gov/files/data/fails-deliver-data/cnsfails202101b.zip](https://www.sec.gov/files/data/fails-deliver-data/cnsfails202101b.zip)

&#x200B;

GME had 2 million shares failed to deliver one day totaling 300 million $

EDIT: Because so many people are bringing up XRT.  Which contains a lot of GME. Here is XRT.  Hmmm.  Notice anything interesting about Jan29th between these two??

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There is also AMC... AMC is still failing to deliver EVERY DAY.  This continues the trend for both of these stocks not being delivered every day.  AMC had 27 million... yes million shares failed to deliver.

&#x200B;

I'd like to ask everyone to do what they can.  I am not recommending buying any of these stocks.  But there is for sure, something still going on.  We need to try and get this data daily.  Contact your reps, etc.

&#x200B;

There are links to information about Failed to deliver.[https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm)

Is GME considered a Threshold Security? ‚úÖ

>In   order to be deemed a  threshold security, and thus subject to the   restrictions of Rule  203(b)(3), a security must exceed the specified   fail level for a period  of five consecutive settlement days.    Similarly, in order to be removed  from the list of threshold   securities, a security must not exceed the  specified level of fails for   a period of five consecutive settlement  days.

Does the Firm have to close out the positions? ‚úÖ

>As adopted, Rule 203(b)(3) requires any participant of a registered clearing agency (""participant"")[80](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P210_72014) to take action on all failures to deliver that exist in such securities ten days after the normal settlement date, *i.e.*, 13 consecutive settlement days.[81](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P211_72496)Specifically,  the participant is required to close out the fail to   deliver position  by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.Rule 203(b)(3) is intended to address potential abuses that may occur with large, extended fails to deliver.[89](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P221_79239)  We believe that the five-day requirement will facilitate the identification of securities with extended fails.

&#x200B;

Edit:  I wrote a quick post about this last report.  I'll copy some stuff here.  AS requested, here are some data snippets for ""normal"" stocks.  note the number of failed to deliver is way lower.

Target stock price was just raised to 260!!

‚ÄúShares of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) rose 0.8% in premarket trading, which would put the on track to open in record territory, after Wedbush analyst Dan Ives raised his price target on the software and cloud giant, citing signs of ""relatively strong cloud deal activity"" during the June quarter. Ives reiterated the outperform rating he's had on the stock for at least the past 21 months but raised his target to $260 from $240, making him most bullish on Microsoft of the 35 analysts surveyed by FactSet. The second most bullish is Wells Fargo's Philip Winslow with a $250 price target, according to FactSet. ""In many cases we are seeing enterprises accelerate their digital transformation and cloud strategy with Microsoft by 6-to-12 months as the prospects of a heavy remote workforce for the foreseeable future now looks in the cards with this COVID-19 backdrop,"" Ives wrote in a note to clients. He believes Azure's cloud momentum is still in its ""early days"" of playing out.

Still feeling bready after this solid DD / [brevidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hl4ymp/bread_has_been_empty_for_the_last_two_weeks_at/)

This is an 7/16 earnings play (SEE EDIT 2 AT BOTTOM). Now is time to early MSFT 220c 7/17, with goal to sell most contracts 7/16 once IV fomo is maxed out. Hold a pair to see how the market reacts as high erogenous risk.

Okay, MSFT used to be a boring-ass tech company. Then something happened back in 2014, Ballmer the Boomer stepped down to [buy a shitty](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/08/steve-ballmer-2-billion-clippers) sports team and my man [Satya Nutella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella) took over and has since spread his chocolatey goodness and rich hazelnut flavor across the nutty tech world. Competition is getting toasty, and MSFT is likely to beat earnings in the oven with strong future guidance. 

The seasoning:

* MS Teams performance is going to be a big deal, as it's [bundled with Office 365](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-teams-now-microsoft-reveals-when-you-can-expect-to-see-49-people-on-screen/) and fully integrated-- mid and large cap companies looking to strengthen work from home muscles would go with this since they likely already pay for it and trust boring MSFT over haute slack, etc.

* [Azure is a growth market](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/07/06/how-microsoft-created-800-billion-in-3-years--can-it-repeat/#1fa6e54c7dd1) during all this, plenty of room for cloud growth in lots of sectors, including government and education, where MSFT holds many, many long-term or no limit contracts

* Last earnings call MSFT said they [saw ""minimal"" impact](https://www.barrons.com/articles/microsoft-stock-rises-after-company-says-covid-19-had-minimal-impact-on-fiscal-third-quarter-earnings-51588193445) due to COVID--and as far as I can tell this is a company basically custom built for a stay-at-home pandemic

* Xbox is a big deal, and the Gamepass streaming tech is getting a major invest, already way [outperforming Sony 5x](https://www.businessinsider.com/xbox-game-pass-is-much-bigger-than-playstation-now-2020-5) with many tier 1 titles and early access, etc., also the FB partnership is important for growth

* Salesforce brought the CRM battle home to Seattle with the purchase of Tableau, and MSFT has been [steadily facelifting](https://msdynamicsworld.com/story/microsoft-launches-preview-dynamics-365-project-operations-how-we-got-here) Dynamics, which it sells to enterprise and gov't customers for a huge premium, sometimes bundling with Power BI

* And the company still puts [emphasis on B2C](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/07/01/introducing-new-onedrive-features-to-share-and-collaborate-across-work-and-life/), because you can still buy individual ""ownership"" licenses of products like Windows and Office, instead of SaaS only, demonstrating market flexibility to maximize profits

* Moat only getting dug deeper through lots of [cross-platform integration](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/microsoft-teams-and-skype-users-can-now-chat-together/) and product bundling (e.g. I can now see *all* my software including xbox from one account)

* Also, I like that MSFT takes 2-4 year risks, and then gets out if it doesn't go well--they're [closing the retail stores](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/techburger/article/R-I-P-Microsoft-Stores-We-hardly-knew-ye-And-15377633.php) they'd opened, which I think is smart baking

The image of MSFT is improving--a lot of the toxic culture stuff has been going away since the invention of Nutella and the stock has been rising steadily now that the market has taken notice. They're able to attract more talent, and they have restructured their leadership.

My positions: MSFT 220c 7/17, MSFT 215c 9/18. I'll admit I also want to buy stock. I'm that retarded for this toasty loaf. Gonna go eat some bread now.

2021-02-10 01:10:46,Why this is just a beginning: a guide for The GME Gang newcomers and a quick recap of the situation,"Listen up you fucks, for most of you this is your first rodeo so let me tell you how this whole thing works. Some of you might remember me when I told you to hop on this tendie train at 9$ [when MSFT deal happened](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j7i28q/gme_launching_right_about_now_microsoft_agreement/), by [my DD about why GameStop is worth 138$](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jcjqba/gme_long_thesis_why_40_target_is_actually_a/) or by my other posts I've made here for months. As you've noticed, I LOVE THE STOCK.

I've held through -90% at the lowest to +10,000% at the highest and I continue holding. I'm down $300k from the ATH at this point and I don't fucking care because this whole thing is far from being over.

Now get these points through your thick head:

    
* **This is a fucking volatile stock.** 

This is how it goes: it shoots up, GME gang rejoices, a bunch of retards buys at the top. Then it crashes down for a while, üåàüêª keep blabbering about how the squeeze has squoze. Rinse and repeat. Every time it shoots up it does it more violently, the amplitude getting larger and larger. And every time it does there is a number of dickheads whining about not buying earlier:

""I wish I bought at $9..."" - when it shot up to $13, and them came down

""I wish I bought at $11..."" - when it shot up to $20, and them came down

""I wish I bought at $17..."" - when it shot up to $70, and them came down

""I wish I bought at $40..."" - when it shot up to $150, and them came down

""I wish I bought at $60..."" - when it shot up to $450, and them came down

**Being in GME gang was always about not caring about temporary swings, because in the end, the price always sets a new ATH**

I've seen this shit happening so many times since October that I just sit there and smile while history repeats itself and my porfolio swings 5-6 digits.

    
    
* **GME was never a squeeze play**, despite what a lot of you retards think. 

Read any DD more than a month old, the whole company is massively undervalued . Read about Ryan Cohen, a person who made a dog food company worth $45bn and who is a fucking shark, once he sets his mind to something he will never back down. Thanks to him we now have a star team assembled at GameStop formed of [Matt Francis, CTO, former Engineering Leader at AWS; Kelli Durkin, Senior Vice President of Customer Care, former Chewy‚Äôs Vice President of Customer Service; Josh Krueger, Vice President of Fulfillment former senior fulfillment roles at Amazon, Walmart, and QVC](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/retail/2021/02/03/gamestop-announces-three-new-hires) (do I need to mention Reggie Fils-Aim√© of a fucking Nintendo?). I am a firm believer that Cohen will manage to grow GameStop at the very least to the size of Chewy ($45bn market cap). Guess what GME has? $4bn. That's 12x bagger and I'm being very conservative here.

**This is not about squeezing the hedge funds, this is about the company establishing it's true share price with wild swings along the way thanks to the üåàüêªs**. The true price for me is (conservatively) the size of Chewy, which translates to $650. I know I said $138 in my previous DD a few months ago, but it was before all the recent news of Ryan Cohen taking over with his star-team.

MOASS was a cherry on top (and still is on the table), not the main play

Also, GameStop had a $6bn in revenue in 2019, Tesla had $24bn. Think about it for a moment
    
    

* **Short interest is still through fucking roof**. 

I know you're used to 100%+ SI and the new 41% number does not quite gets you off, but it's still fucking abysmal. VW, OSTK happened on less than 20%. Also keep in mind that this number is for 1/29, literally the top when a lot of shorts covered. It does not account for all the shorting that happened on the way down to $50 which I guaran-fucking-tee you was massive. Just wait and see the next report with increased SI, the shorts never learn.



**TL;DR:** GameStop is still undervalued. Conservative PT is $650, ambitious - $1200+ (assuming Ryan Cohen's success, which I don't doubt for a single moment). Short squeeze will last for a long time similar to $TSLA squeeze, with wild swings along the way - old shorts will cover, new ones will pile in because the bLoCkBuStEr narrative is still strong. This is still a risky gamble, no such thing as a sure bet, but the risk\reward is massively skewed to the upside

If you have short-dated calls you might be fucked, might be not. If you have shares or LEAPS, just get away from screens for a while if it's unbearable for you, but ultimately you'll be fucking loaded. This is one of those situations when in a year or two the price is $3000+ and you post your cost basis of $70 and all the paper-handed bitches in the comments scream ""WOW HE FUCKING HELD GRATZ""

2020-06-26 16:51:18,The downfall of man has been predicted by MSFT $200 since ancient times,"It was foretold since before the beginning of time itself.

The evidence goes back as far as ancient history.

Cave drawings found in the Alps depict ancient Neanderthals paying tribute to a being known in local folklore as ‚Äúthe great one‚Äù B√ºell G√§otse, depicted holding a symbol similar to the Windows^TM icon over its head. It was thought that once the great one was satisfied with his bounty of 200 precious stones, he would lower the icon down unto the masses and deliver them to the great ‚ÄúT√™nd√Æ‚Äù place in the sky. Instead, disgusted by their greed, the great one dashed the icon down upon them, and millennia of suffering followed, until the Neanderthals went extinct to the Cro-Magnon peoples.

Egyptian hieroglyphics, unproven until now, foretold of the arrival of Mustafarat‚Äôs Army of 200, and the beginnings of the apocalypse. Mustafarat and his followers would unleash a plague upon the people of the Nubia, salt their fields, and poison the Nile with the blood of diseased bulls for hundreds of years to come.

Ancient Greeks predicted of the end times being preceded by Hera (from which the Romans adapted the god Juno, for June) discovering the 200 infidelities of Zeus with his mistress Masfites in their bed. Distraught she would break the family of Gods apart in a war between her and her husband that would ravage the Earth below.

Nostradamus foretold of the ‚ÄúTragedy of Twos‚Äù writing that ‚ÄúOn the 22nd day of Juno of the year 2020, Man shall witness the coming of 200 to its most powerful symbol. Man will rejoice, but his commemoration is in err. Twice will Man be struck by plague and civil disorder, and twice again will his coffers and fields be struck while Man‚Äôs paragon of disorder fiddles in his tower.‚Äù

Heinrich Himmler, days before the end of World War Two, launched into a psychosis induced divination. He attempted to contact the Old Gods in an effort to turn the war around and preserve the 1000 year Reich. Instead, he gleamed a vision of his enemies of the East and West succumbing to plague, civil unrest, and economic collapse brought forth by the symbol of their greed:

So my heory is Microsoft teams is going to explode. Corona has spiked work from home, stay at home, and learn from home. So between businesses, doctors, schools, and people gaming cause there's nothing better to do, they should have an extremely strong quarter. They also dropped all their brick and mortar stores. Which is a $450million tax write off. Not to mention their Azure cloud storage. This should be a massive spike for their business. Oh! And over 64million computers sold this quarter with MSFT 10 on all of them.  And with new statistics saying 1/3 of jobs can be done from home, I think a shit ton of companies will stay that way since it decreases their overhead when they won't have to lease as much space for offices.

Lots of words below, so here‚Äôs the TL;DRs, Table of Contents, a self dox, and position disclosure before my DD.

**TL;DR #1**: After watching Demo Day twice, I am blown away at how much Palantir‚Äôs products have matured in the last 6 years since I left Palantir. I find the new UX far superior to offerings from GOOG, MSFT, and CRM. Apollo is absolutely incredible, and it‚Äôs going where no clouds have gone before‚Ä¶ from Humvees to nuclear submarines. Lastly, it is clear to me that PLTR has invested heavily in best-of-class administrative tools to improve the speed to deploy Palantir. Bottom line: I fully understand why IBM gave up fighting Palantir and is now selling Palantir Foundry to IBM clients.

PLTR when I left in 2015 versus the Palantir I saw on Demo Day:

[You've come a long way baby.](https://preview.redd.it/fuvi00aejph61.jpg?width=1182&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d993cff432e6b8f49b6728ac4d180cbbb2979080)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #2:** IBM just surrendered to PLTR. In the words of POTUS, this is a‚Ä¶

# Big.

# Fucking.

# Deal.

To put it politely, IBM and Palantir don‚Äôt have a very good past relationship. So the fact that IBM is now pushing Foundry means one thing: Foundry is so unfuckwithable that IBM was losing numerous contracts to Foundry-wielding competitors and IBM had no choice but to swallow their pride and cut a deal with Papa Karp.

* First they ignore you.
* Then they laugh at you.
* Then they fight you.
* Then they surrender to you and sign a deal to slang Foundry to thousands of clients in 180 countries.
* Then they send your shareholders tendies for decades.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #3:** Regardless of how ‚Äògood‚Äô or ‚Äòbad‚Äô the 2020 earnings are tomorrow, I find the news from early 2021 to be an incredibly strong signal pointing to an eventual $250B+ market cap for Palantir ‚Äì BP renewing their enterprise deal, Rio Tinto and PG&E signing a new enterprise deals, AT&T aggressively hiring for Palantir skills, and 2,500 IBMers now pushing Foundry to clients all over the world, etc. IE the tea leaves I'm reading point to strong growth in 2021 and beyond.

It's also worth mentioning that many of the new commercial clients have some of the most difficult and complex supply chains in the world.

If they‚Äôre in, I‚Äôm in.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #4**: Eventually, institutional traders will comprehend the immense long-term value of ~~Planeteer~~ ~~Planter~~ Palantir and the stock will join the PFAANG club (though I vote that we rename it the FAAPNG club).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Because there are so many shills, pumpers, and bullshiters on WSB these days, I‚Äôll self dox myself. I‚Äôm Jason Payne. I joined Palantir in early 2007, when it was a few dozen geeks with big dreams, and left in 2015 to become the CEO of [Ada Diamonds](https://www.adadiamonds.com/) (hence my username).

I joined Reddit to do an official [AMA on laboratory-grown diamonds](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8pb8d5/i_grow_diamonds_i_make_custom_jewelry_with_these/) a few years ago that hit the front page, stuck around, and have absolutely fallen in love with the Reddit community. Thus, I want to give back to my fellow Redditors with a bunch of words and a few pictures to explain Palantir from the perspective of a former employee.

You may think that I‚Äôm a Palantir sock puppet given how my bullish I am in this DD. I‚Äôm not. Turns out I have a DD-writing fetish. Don‚Äôt kink shame. [Here‚Äôs a couple of my prior DDs](https://medium.com/@Jason_Payne) on De Beers, Tiffany & Co., and the FTC.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Positions or ban:** At the current PLTR share price, I hold a Keyser S√∂ze position - I could sell out this week and simply walk off into the sunset. But I‚Äôm not going to. I have yet to sell all of my unlocked 20%, and I plan to mostly diamond hands my soon-to-be-unlocked 80%, with a decade long diversification plan to exit my concentrated stock position, regardless of earnings tomorrow.

Why? I like the stock, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#1) Praise & Constructive Criticism for Demo Day**

Existentially, Demo Day was incredibly impressive. This thread with u/namingisreallyhard, u/DentalFox, and u/jamauer sums it up:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d0p7dwzijph61.jpg?width=526&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9caa7b51ca8f7c2315988eda62f4afa7f30f7b07

Four things stood out to me:

**Superior Design Language to CRM, MSFT, and GOOG:** Palantir has a completely different front-end user experience (UX) than my time at Palantir, that I saw for the first time on Demo Day. I find it practical, beautiful, and efficient.

The design language is called Blueprint Javascript, and it‚Äôs built on React, a modern web development platform that Facebook built. Big ups to Palantir for open sourcing BlueprintJS, meaning that anyone can use it: [https://blueprintjs.com/](https://blueprintjs.com/)

Blueprint is a UI toolkit for web development of complex data-dense interfaces for desktop applications. Compared to the cartoonish UX of Salesforce‚Äôs Lightning, the flat UX of Google, and the rigid UX of Microsoft Office, I would much prefer to work in Blueprint all day.

I struggle with how spread out Lightning is by default and really appreciated how dense the Blueprint inerfaces are without feeling crowded. Getting that balance right is really difficult.

**Deep Investment in Deployability**: Administrative tools are the unloved stepchild of enterprise software. No-one buys the backend system, so minimal investments are typically made to build the backend tools to run the software.

Salesforce still hasn‚Äôt ported their admin tools from their clunky Web 1.0 Salesforce Classic to their more modern Lightning design system. Google‚Äôs back end admin tools suck compared to their client facing tools - Gmail, Calendar, AdWords, etc.

The admin tools that Palantir demoed appeared far better than what I use every day to run my Salesforce instance. I bet I could do most tasks in Foundry 40-75% faster than Salesforce.

**Migration from ‚Äò*****Find the Terrorist*****‚Äô to '*****Cheat Code for War*****':** When I was at Palantir, the primary use case for Gotham was link analysis to find the bad guy. Gotham has clearly evolved from that mission to a far broader set of missions.

Another Redditor described Gotham as ‚Äòcheat code for war,‚Äô and I think that is spot on. That‚Äôs why Palantir has won so many different logistics, mission planning, command and control, etc. military contracts recently, including the Space Force

**DoD IL-6 SaaS Approval:** Palantir moving to IL-6 approval could be an entire massive DD on its own, but I‚Äôll keep it short. It‚Äôs a big fucking deal to get Apollo running on classified networks, and Palantir is far ahead of the other big SaaS players in this approval:

https://preview.redd.it/hl1j7wwkjph61.jpg?width=1314&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4dc190a30dc75e8d66bcd6c8ab74cb42472137d

Now that I have fanboied on Demo Day I want to be critical of the presentation style of Demo Day. I‚Äôd give the presenters a C+ at best. I found it rushed, confusing, and difficult to follow. I had to watch it twice to fully absorb the content, and I‚Äôve given 500+ Palantir demos in my lifetime! My constructive criticism:

* Slow down 15-20%
* Err on the side of a simpler, more approachable lexicon
* For the love of God, stop reading from scripts. Use bullet points
* Handoffs were way to abrupt. Take a deep breath between presenters for us to get prepared for a new topic
* Get better microphones and Snowsound panels for future presentations
* Get a professional public speaking coach involved in rehearsals

I‚Äôm not alone in my take on Demo Day. Here are a few unprompted DMs I got from random Redditors on the presentation:

>*¬∑ I don't know if it is just me, but I genuinely felt like I was watching a haphazard presentation that didn't really do justice nor capture attention in a lucrative way*  
>  
>*¬∑ It lacked charisma and charm, and it felt cobbled together like a group project by university students*  
>  
>*¬∑ I was watching the demo day presentation, and left feeling underwhelmed. It may have been impressive to someone who is in the industry, but from someone outside of it, it all sounded greek to me.*  
>  
>*¬∑ I felt like the Gotham team was clearly the A team and Foundry needs better presentation skills.*

I know my last PLTR DD made the rounds at Palantir, so here‚Äôs a direct message to those behind Demo Day - if everyone told you that you ‚Äò*killed it*,‚Äô you \*really\* need to find someone in the organization willing to speak truth to power.

\_\_\_\_\_

**#2) Why Palantir is a Diamond Fisted Iron Man Suit**

One of the Demo Day presenters made an interesting comment that stuck with me: At Palantir, we build Iron Man suits, not robots.

No, Palantir does not have a skunk works program building flying mech suits (AFAIK).

Palantir builds *cerebral* cyborgs, not *physical* cyborgs. Palantir‚Äôs products create a symbiotic relationship between human beings and computers to better solve *cerebral* tasks, not *physical* tasks.

&#x200B;

[Iron Man. Cerebral Edition.](https://preview.redd.it/77xps5ipjph61.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb3acbee813e27ca69f7b94c9158fba44c6e142a)

If you have not watched Demo Day yet (or you rewatch it), listen for how many times they say the words ‚Äòdecision‚Äô and ‚Äòdecision makers.‚Äô

Why a **diamond fisted** Iron Man suit? Palantir just closed an enterprise deal with Rio Tinto, who is the 3rd largest diamond producer in the world. So Rio Tinto will be using their PLTR-powered Iron Man suits to dig for fistfuls of diamonds on multiple continents.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**#3) The True ROI of Palantir**

Palantir is really expensive. No question about it.

But you know what‚Äôs more expensive than Palantir? Bad Decisions. Being wrong is really, really expensive. See the Airbus 380, Microsoft‚Äôs market share of cell phones, the Golden State Warriors drafting Todd Fuller over Kobe Bryant, shorting GME in early January, and BMW/Mercedes/Lexus‚Äôs dismissal of TSLA.

The true ROI of Palantir is substantially better decision making across your organization. Even a moderate improvement in decision making creates deep fucking value for an organization.

For example, Airbus claims that Foundry helped them improved the speed of A350 production by 33%. There are 5 million discrete parts in an A350, and the Foundry-powered decisions led to a 33% improvement in production. Palantir doesn‚Äôt make that claim. Airbus makes that claim. That‚Äôs absolutely bonkers and that‚Äôs why this is no surprise:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ns8wcvvsjph61.jpg?width=675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fb13831b6f18b58f53fa5131f6543e950e8569f

The BP renewal and the new deals (PG&E, Rio Tinto, Fiat, etc) prove u/petroduct is right. If you have complex logistics, you should have Foundry.

Say that Palantir improves the quality of decisions made at United Airlines by 6.9%. How much will the UAL stock appreciate over the next decade? If Palantir helps Rio Tinto improve decision making by 4.20%, how much will their bottom line grow by 2025?

Below are a few excerpts from United's Director of Technical Operations on how they use Foundry. This is just scratching the surface of how an airline can use Palantir to improve operations; however, if each of these models/decisions are incrementally improved, even a little bit, the value to United is fucking deep.

The entire blog post is a great read if you want to go deeper on Foundry: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/)

>*\[minor edits for brevity\]*  
>  
>*The return-to-service model recommends which specific aircraft to return at which time in the future and how to utilize our available maintenance capacity (internal & external) to ensure they‚Äôre airworthy when we need them. Since we don‚Äôt know when air travel demand will recover, the models need to account for slow recoveries, fast recoveries, and everything in between.*  
>  
>*Our optimization models consider when ‚Äúbig events‚Äù (airframe checks, engine overhauls, and landing gear overhauls) will be due, along with the cost of those events and the available maintenance capacity to complete them. The models also incorporate other factors: parts availability and cost, available technician hours at each maintenance station, ability to secure supplemental maintenance lines at external MRO providers, aircraft-specific mechanical reliability and on-time performance, and even the quality of the in-flight products (seats, Wi-Fi, entertainment, power outlets).*  
>  
>*The team is also helping optimize the cycling of active and parked aircraft whenever we have surplus planes available to fly, which ensures regulatory compliance with the maintenance program, minimizes operating costs, and enables our Tech Ops team to be very intentional about balancing our operational objectives ‚Äì do we want to fly the most reliable aircraft, the lowest cost aircraft, or the aircraft with the most time left until its next major maintenance event?*

**#4) Muthafuckin‚Äô Clouds in Nuclear Submarines**

Toward the end of the Apollo demo, one of the presenters offhandedly mentioned something that caused my jaw to hit the floor: Palantir will be deploying Apollo on US Navy submarines.

IL-6. Clouds. In. Nuclear. Submarines.

As someone who has installed and managed Palantir servers in server rooms all over the world, I can‚Äôt state how huge it is that the US Navy is approving the Apollo modular cloud architecture to be deployed on some of their most sensitive and expensive assets.

The fact that upgrades to the entire fleet can be managed like upgrading an AWS server?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mvmtqwdvjph61.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef22d9c598c63b3bd4e488b8439bc4082ff9f5ba

\_\_\_\_\_

**#5) Does it Matter that Palantir Needs FDEs at Deployments?**

One of the favorite arguments of the Palantir bears is that Palantir is an unscalable, overvalued services company that should have the same P/E as Accenture, Booz, BAE, etc. The bears say that Palantir only has a handful of clients and can‚Äôt scale. In my mind, the quality of the admin tools show on Demo Day and the IBM partnership announcement eviscerated that argument.

When I was at Palantir, it was a bitch to build and manage deployments. From what I saw on Demo Day, Palantir is now easier than Salesforce to deploy. I say that as someone who has written tens of thousands of lines of code for Salesforce (Lightning, Apex, SOQL and Visualforce).

Eventually, Palantir will have the same ecosphere of 3rd party developers that deploy and manage instances of SAP, Salesforce, Microsoft, etc. but that will take years to fully mature that ecosphere. Eventually, Palantir will have robust certifications for various skills and tasks to manage Palantir deployments.

But in the meantime, Palantir's Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) will continue to directly manage deployments. Given how much progress Palantir has made on the tools to improve the efficiency of the FDEs, I no longer worry about the scalability of that team.

Say that three utility companies all buy Palantir ‚Äì PG&E, ConEd, and Entergy.  Palantir invests 4 years worth of FDE time in PG&E, 1 year in ConEd, and none in Entergy.

* PG&E improves decision making by 10% and does a massive enterprise deal with Palantir to deploy to every part of the organization.
* ConEd improves decision making by 2% and does a moderate renewal for a few specific teams.
* Entergy bungles their deployment and actually makes worse decision as a result. They do not renew.

Assuming \~$500k/year all in is the cost for a good FDE at Palantir, we're talking about small up front investments that return bigly for PLTR in the long run as those deployments are extended like the BP deal.

To put it another way, when you think about Palantir deployments in months or years, the FDE overhead is spooky. But when you think about those deployments converting into decade long *operating system for XXXXXX* deals, the FDE overhead is not significant.

Also, to be honest, there are very few people with TS/SCI security clearances that even know what React is, much less how to write code against it, so in some of the more sensitive use cases for Palantir, I think that FDEs will be the way for a long time.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#6) Should you YOLO on PLTR?**

I‚Äôm not going to give anyone financial advice, but I do want to point out a few things:

PLTR is not a meme stock. Palantir is not a small-cap that can move bigly because, a bunch of furry quadrupeds gathering on internet messaging boards collectively decide that we like the stock.

Palantir is a bunch of wickedly smart people building Iron Man suits for the largest, most important organizations in the world.

Many of the larger institutional investors still don‚Äôt truly comprehend Palantir and the medium term public valuation may not properly reflect the present and future value created by Palantir. I have no idea when the analysts will finally get the value of PLTR.

A lot of historically successful investors think PLTR is extremely overvalued. They may be right.

A lot of historically successful investors have massive positions long PLTR. CathThey may be right.

So my crystal ball says PLTR may go up, down, or sideways for longer than you can stay solvent or interested in Karp memes.

Regardless of the ticker, if you YOLO, please YOLO responsibly my friends, and for the love of god take some off the table if/when you‚Äôre fortunate enough to have green dildoes in your accounts‚Äì whether your gains are from PLTR or any other stock you happen to like, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#7) My Appreciation for the Palantir Team**

I do want to take a moment and say to anyone who has been a part of building Palantir over the last few decades: what you have built is incredible. Thank you. As an American, thank you. As a stockholder, thank you.

Enjoy your tendies, you‚Äôve earned them my friends.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#8) How I Play My Lockup**

Regardless of how the markets view the earnings report tomorrow, I‚Äôm largely HODLing my remaining Palantir shares, as I think Palantir is in a class of it‚Äôs own, lapping the competition like SpaceX and Tesla.

I do have a professional advisor and we have prepared tax-optimized divestment strategies for a number of scenarios, but none of those scenarios involve paper handing out of my remaining position, regardless of a good, bad, or ugly response to the 2020 earnings report tomorrow.

Why would I sell now if I believe that FAANG-like is growth coming over the next 10 years? Why would I sell when I think Palantir in 2021 is like Mercedes F1 in 2014 about to go on a worldwide domination over the next few years? Also, with the shares finally unlocked, I can borrow against them for the first time.

I've already responsibly taken enough off the table pre-IPO, so I‚Äôm not in any rush to sell. My first substantial limit order will be at a market cap of \~$100B with a ladder up to \~$250B. So I‚Äôm skeptical that I‚Äôll sell any more than 5% of my remaining shares this week.

That‚Äôs my $0.02 on Demo Day and some of the recent news.

So long, and thanks for all the tendies. See ya at the restaurant at the end of the universe PLTR gang!

MSFT 230C 9/18

I bought those calls on Friday, it's now down 40%, I had a chance to walk away today with a 20% loss (2k) but I decided to hold, I still think the deal will go through, here is my analysis:

* From the point of view of POTUS, banning Tiktok or forcing Tiktok to be sold to American are both viable options. It will most likely draw him more support in the election since Tiktok users are probably going to vote against him anyway 

* It is very unlikely that Tiktok can win its lawsuit, and everyone is well aware of that

* Banning Tiktok will not hurt US's interests to any extend (unlike huaiwei and zte, where you can see multiple extensions were given to them, and there were much more resistances), after Tiktok is banned, their marketshare will be gobbled up by other companies like facebook

* Tiktok has no bargaining power because of what is said above, and it is running out of time

* Tiktok has a good algorithm to provide personalized feed, this is part that China require a license to export. Many people thinks that without this algorithm, Tiktok is just an empty shell. I disagree with that, this algorithm is most likely just one micro service from the entire cloud infrastructure. Their data, users (existing market share)  are more valuable assets.

* If facebook can create a Tiktok rip off, microsoft should not have much difficulty with integration  

* $30 billion is a lot of money for any company, if Tiktok is outright banned, there is nothing that could be recovered, I do not believe Bytedance and its investors will allow it to die like this when there are better options

* Believe it or not, the Chinese government is here to serve the interest of Chinese companies. In my opinion, the announcement on Aug 28th is to help Tiktok to gain more bargaining power, since they are most likely facing pressure to sell off their AI algorithms as well. 

* If I was the CEO of ByteDance, I would want this to be over sooner rather than later, as time approaches the deadline, they have more to lose than Microsoft/Oracle. And if Tiktok is banned for a few days, they will lose a large portion if not all of their market share, since there is no royalty in this sort of business

* Oracle is less likely to win due to a couple of reasons, 1. WMT decided to partner with MSFT not ORCL. 2. ByteDance is facing pressure from the Chinese market as well, selling the company with close relationship with the POTUS can have negative affects to the domestic market

Of course, there are a lot of risks and uncertainties as well, notably:

* Somehow Oracle won the bid, the I would probably lose all my money

* I don't know what is a likelihood that an extension would be given to Tiktok, since their strategy can be to drag this on, this is probably the highest risk that would mess up with my calls. However, a few days ago, Tiktok reassured their employees more ""clarity"" for their future (https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/tiktok-executives-reassure-employees-after-ceo-exit-1.1485955)

* ByteDance is criticized for begin too soft (when in reality they really have no control over the situation), and Chinese consumers threaten to boycott Douyin (chinese TikTok) if Tiktok was sold to an American company

If she does not, the Defense Department has said **it plans to issue the first ‚Äúsubstantive‚Äù JEDI task order to Microsoft on Friday.""**

[Source](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/defense-main/2020/02/aws-seeks-trump-testimony-in-jedi-cloud-lawsuit/)

If all goes accordingly, headlines will read AWS defeated by Azure. Refocusing attention on Microsoft's profitable and growing cloud business. Not to mention, this is a 10 year deal with openings to new government cloud deals.

***Why is this a big deal?***

From my personal experience in the cloud business, I've worked directly with one of Amazon's subsidiaries on large cloud deals (over 7-figures) in Asia & South America for streaming services that needed low-latency that AWS could not provide due to their datacenter locations. It took our company over 7 months through litigation, red-lines, etc to finalize a contract. One the contract was finished and approved, getting new business can be done in the same day, i.e., once Microsoft is awarded, they can continue growing their government deals as needed, in the same day.

Thus, tomorrow's ruling is a big win (if it happens) for Microsoft.

Update: [the author just posted a new article](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/defense-main/2020/02/as-key-jedi-court-decision-looms-pentagon-warns-of-national-security-concerns/)

A few key takeaways:

1. ""...the government argued not only that Amazon lacks the necessarily legal basis to get the temporary stop-work order, issuing one would cause **concrete harm to national security**.""

*Favors MSFT*

2) ""...To win the injunction, among other factors, Amazon needs to show that it‚Äôs likely to win the underlying lawsuit and that it its interests would suffer more without a work stoppage than the government‚Äôs would if the JEDI buildout was paused.""

*Favors MSFT*

this is also basically my magnum fucking opus so upvote retards. Dont give me awards, legit go buy a powerup membership for a year. Cant tell you to buy shares because we gonna get closed down by SEC somehow.

im also not some fininacial advisor or whatever just read this and make your own conclusions degenerates. Im not fucking liable lmao but i am balls deep 125 shares @ 19 average now, its literally all I have on this earth.

TLDR: GME DD sumarized, Margin wont affect longs the same way as shorts right now. Dont buy shares on margin though and get ready to supply collateral regardless. Short interest is up and some smart retards are on our side. Read the post to raise your IQ from 8 to 9 though. **üêª üåàs  mega fuk and even posting high level bear shit to scare us.**

Basically been seeing posts about ""blah blah margin this, short interest this, WS to clever blah"". Going to split this post into distinct sections but im no english degree so dont expect any bear bloomberg  level shit or something

# 1. GME is a fucking steal regardless of squeeze. Buy now or be left on a dying planet while we head to alpha fucking centauri.

So basically everyone here knows about Ryan cohen and his horsemen of the apocalypse coming to steal melvins lunch money. This man bought apple stock in 2017. Hes fucking rich. Hes also an eccommerce wizard, taking CHEWY from a measly 100k co-founded company to a $4 Billion company in 2017 at which point he sold it to petsmart or something. Its now valued at $40 Billion, granted anything eccommerce now gets money thrown at it like a stripper in a high flying strip club or some shit , so dont listen to me, so it may well be a bubble. Regardless the thing grows its revenue like bacteria doing binary fission on agar jelly üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ.

THEY SELL FUCKING PET FOOD. the market for that is like what? $1?. Gaming is going to the moon and is basically recession proof because of how cheap game is compared to other things for how much you get out of it. Any bears saying that Gamestop cant compete with digital or with amazon. Ryan cohen already slapped amazons head in with a no name brand. Hell fucking do it again. About digital everyone here already knows, microsoft deal, Ryan cohen also mentioned the possibility of having ""Digital game exchanging"" or something, image below.

[Online trade ins. It says online.üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ](https://preview.redd.it/2ba9j5d2zvb61.png?width=414&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b6f3f26c3588fdb8cc779aee8a3b1ce42859f33)

He also mentions streaming, digital content etc and aside from all the digital stuff wants GME to move to a community centric structure where big stores operate with VR centres, Internet cafe, table games like Dungeons and dragons and  40k (rapidly growing somehow will boom post covid) and as we now might know due to this post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme\_dd\_buildapc\_kiosks\_coming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/)

BUILD YOUR OWN PC KIOSKS. This is the literal smell of money. Go to your Gamestop to build your PC with your kid? Gamestop is already the goto place wher your parents go to get you your latest digital fix so now they can go build PC's and it cant go tits up?

**Now for some pussy boomer talk (aka fundametals or something).**

The expected Q3 EPS was -0.84$ or something close to that. The actual loss was -0.53$ but boomzoids only talked about the revenue drop. No shit sherlock its closing all its dead weight stores.

In the holiday report I will talk about a bit more below, 11% of stores were closed and revenue dropped only 3%. Comparitive store sales increased nearly 5%. They cant get enough consoles to sell so expect the momentum to carry on for the whole year I expect. Eccommerce is up 300% over holidays. In Q3 they reported 800% to date. In 2020 Gamestops eccomerce went up 24x. YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT. Online sales now account for \~33% of Gamestops sales now. This is literally gold dust for ryan cohen.

We are still trading at 0.38 P/S at this price. The average P/S for the SP500 is 2.753. Massive upside on these two numbers alone.

Burry got in this for the MOASS and the intrinsic value. At the time intrinsic value was like $22 and this will pump up as RC takes it to new heights.

GME in Q3 somehow halved the expected loss. Big Bad Boomer sherman somehow didnt fuck it up that bad by saying ""omnichannel"" at the speed of light. Yes the revenue dropped 30% but thats covid for you. As the PC kiosk post above shows GME now sells small items basically so fast they have to have fake stock lmao. The new console cycle always spikes the share price sky high too, as youll see in a crayon drawing later. The potential revenue that this console cycle brings in could be huge. Biggest ever is potentially a true statement and Gamestop sells every fucker they get. Combine the fact that they share game pass ( a massive hit) revenue from the xboxes they sell, something no other retailer has, revenue could be sky high.

Now I know you autists are starting to develop short term dyslexia or something but keep reading. This could be the most important piece of shit you read in your life. How do you think I feel? My brains overheating just trying to write coherent sentences.

Holdiay report was a bear trap imo, saw people saying the decrease in revenue was bearish blah blah blah. Lies. Comparitve store sales rose 5% and thats with some towns having like 4 gamestops. When the leases dont get renewed and these stores get liquidated (Also in Ryan cohens letter) they can just get this influx of cash and pay down debt and invest in logistics and marketing and new growth. Gamestop realistically needs like 1/2 the stores they have now and just need to improve efficiency.

[https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890) this article the messiah himself wrote. In it he states:

>At Chewy, we had maniacal discipline when it came to how we spent money. The company-wide culture of frugality came from his example. Free cash flow was our unwavering governor of growth. We grew Chewy from $200 million in sales in 2013 to $3.5 billion in 2018 while spending only $130 million in capital, all of which went into opening distribution centers across the country and acquiring new customers.

Maniacal. Thats all I need to say. The guy is going to get to mars before papa musk and he wont even break a sweat. When FCF starts to catch up to WS expectations every analyst who donwgraded them is gonna get ditched and upgrades will start to happen.

So in the heading i said its a steal. That implies some future higher price target right? Well here is my guess for a conservative price target based on the information above and also some more I probably forgot cos im a retard.

[The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares \(another reason shorts are fuk\)](https://preview.redd.it/dehiug393wb61.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=f198773c36d5109382eb2beba6fade3c059121df)

>The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares (another reason shorts are fuk)

This alone means if for not inflation adjusted terms we reached 9.8Bn or whatever the crayon chart says we should reach:

9.8/2.48 = \~3.95   3.95 \* $35.5 = \~$140. The share price now to reach old mkt cap is $140 fucking dollars. Thats a 4 bagger from now. It gets better.

from [statista](https://statista.com) :

>Considering the **annual inflation rate in the United States** in recent years, a 2.24 percent **inflation rate** is a very moderate projection.

If we take 2.24% inflation, the this share price target in todays money means we should reach $182 because of $140 \* 1.0224\^12, = $182 in adjusted. Thats more than a 5 bagger. basically we could see $10 GME price from short manipulation and buying more is basically a lottery ticket!

I really dont understand the bear thesis. The only bear thesis ( short term this one) was that margin would affect longs more but I looked at it on ortex and its basically bullshit. Buy shares with cash though dont use margin. Own your piece of GME dont borrow it. Bears just spout ""DigITaL"" or ""BlOCKbuSTER"" so much Ryan tweeted a shit emoji at them. All the bears think theyre clever. What the fuck makes those guys special? How are they different now than the ones from $2, or $4, or $10.

**Bears are betting against:**

Ryan fucking cohen, buisness legend CHEWY from 100k investment, now 40 billion

Michael burry, Investing legend, predicted the housing crisis and is in GME since april

u/DeepFuckingValue , the new WSB god chad, now basically a whale

Reggie Fils-Aim√©, gaming and buisness legend, former COO of nintendo

Senvest, a mega fund thats actively managed

Norweigan sovereign wealth fund

Fidelity, Vanguard and blackrock own this shit and are never selling they literally dont give a shit

All of WSB has now formed a shield wall against the bears

Microsoft gave GME highly discounted azure deals and free office use for all employees and a revenue sharing agreement. Bears are stupid if they think MSFT didnt vet GME.

&#x200B;

Some valid bear thesis left now (the only ones left) ----> Ryan Cohen dies.

# 2. Now some analysis on the short squeeze and some technical data on puts and calls and ortex data.

Ok everyone on here and their cat, dog, bedbugs and wifes boyfriend  knows about the squeeze. Jimmy chill aka cramer even talking about it. Gamestop is literally the most shorted stock of all time and space. The squeeze makes every autist salivate because its basically free money while cucking big money out of like what 1% of their fund.

Although I know all you cucks hate shares, and hate holding, if the squeeze doesnt happen selling is probably the most retarded thing anyone could do. Its literally buy high sell low and you fucking disgust me. STONK ONLY GOES UP.

This squeeze is so monumental that its been sucking sharks in like fresh blood. Most of the funds where shorting this from 30-15 dollars before this year so they didnt really care. It all changed with 2 people. u/DeepFuckingValue and Dr. Michael Burry. These guys are as OG as it gets with GME. I think u/DeepFuckingValue may have even sniffed this trade out before the legend himself. Since then funds will have churned this through their rules and started jumping on this train. Ive been in since $13 with 125 shares. If I had more money Id be buying but im just some stupid student ok. Im merely a medium for this money made information.

**The stats for this stock now short wise are, from ortex:**

*Concrete* short interest as of 31 December 2020: **71 Million**.

*Estimated* short interest, *January 11th data:* (This isnt predicted, this is from data in flow, has margin of error) : **77 Million**

Short shares on loan 7 days ago: **50 Million**

Short shares on loan *now* (This breaks the bearish margin calls affect longs more thesis): 54.2 Million

% of known float short: **147%** as of 31 December 2020

% of know free float on loaned shorts: **108%** as of January 11th.

Some [guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyocql/updated_potential_holdings_of_gme/) on here took into account extra buying on wednesday, Institutions, Burry, RC's extra 7% and WSB ownership (something so stupendously  retarded no serious firm will do it) that float on short could be in the 100s of %. Total short float now I would say could be **200-400%** if the numbers are correct.  This pisses on all other short squeezes. Some countries ban shorting above 100% cos of how autistic it is.

The recent hike in interactive brokers available shares is probably a mix of sell off on friday (remember  some guys are now buying lambos with GME money. If they held they could buy 10), calls exercising and puts being covered and brokers ditching the shares. Nakedshort even reported 5 million naked GME shorts on friday. This is bullish as fuck because the best the shorts could do on a red market day was **-10%**.

Gamestop is still on the SECs threshold list for 27 days now.

[This shows naked short selling and downwards pressure hasnt capitulated](https://preview.redd.it/xsetax08pwb61.jpg?width=1083&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=172439b81f509ba01ed3e6489671d6f009298e84)

Ok so now if WSB owns an estimated 6-8% of the stock and we all know to move over to cash accounts now to avoid margin calls, we should be minimizing longs getting margin called. Every bear on stockwits is a clueless cuck who spouts ""blockbuster"" and these guys dont even know what margin even is so my bet is the colossal **54 Million** shares short on loan are gonna be affected by the margin calls more. Why? Because every long on margin is in the green, and now a true zealot/extremist/autist for ryan cohen so will supply their account with collateral to avoid margin call. Shorts are in the massive red zone. How do I know you ask?

Ortex data from Jan 4th 2021:

[This is the data from ortex for short interest for Gamestop for Jan 4th](https://preview.redd.it/urqb3c3zbwb61.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=d874cd908bad7fe3e8aa4486b5a294f5c1d5724e)

So this shows for jan 4th the estimated short interest is 66.98 Million shares. From the exchange reported 71 Million on december 31st this makes a lot of sense because the share price fell from \~21 to \~17 so shorts took profits. The shares on loan arent for longs too. This is all purely short data, and 47M  shorted at $17 this shows.

These shorts are in a circle of hell we cant comprehend and makes satan scared.

SHARES ON LOAN HAVE GONE UP.  BUT 87% OF LOANED SHORTS WHERE SHORTING AT SUB $20.

Cost to borrow is also up, estimated short interest is up to a cataclysmic amount.

Longs on margin need to supply collateral, but we are in the massive green zone, shorts are underwater. Margin calls will ravage the shorts and sting the longs. We also have the uptick rule in place until the end of the day, so shorts can only short on the way up.

**Seen a lot of talk about Gamma hedging and delta.**

You realize that the fucking bankers and brokers dont understand gamma hedging right? That shits up their with the black-scholes equation and feynman-kac solution. Forget about it. The retards claiming to understand it are either payed by hedge funds or lose money. The guy who took out outs thinking options exercising and gamma hedging would lead to a collossal sell off on friday lost money on his puts because **no one** except some quants in a goldman sachs server room know this shit. The idea is simple about neutral delta on options that people take out, but the simple system interacts with every other thing in the stock market, and wow who couldve guessed it, like nearly any other element of the stock market predicting something by the day is nigh impossible. That guy talking about Gamma , Delta and margin calls is on weeklies. Hes no more autistic and equally retarded as all of us. Hes a chill guy though so dont berate a fellow brother.

**Now weve established the likelihood of longs getting margin called is far smaller than shorts, on to the options distributions**

These two graphs, show before market close and after. As we can see the massiver 51000 put contracts didnt get rolled over and the chances that those were melvins july puts rolled up is very high. They expired worthless. Lots of calls are printing big time while huge amounts of puts are worthless and bleeding money.

Something else we can extrapolate from the charts is that massive options trades are not present on the scale we saw before (tens of thousands).

We are seeing a discrepancy in the number of puts/calls opening up at the higher prices with calls gaining fast. This could show that some funds are now becoming optimistic on the long or short term prospects of gamestop. There are also more puts than options and if we assume this for shorts vs longs on margin (without even taking into account that all shorts are borrowed shares and pay interest further bleeding cash) then shorts are likely on more margin than longs.

Regardless fellow autists my main point is two show that the bears are underwater and the bulls are flying high with regards to options.

**Now lets compare this possible squeeze with others.**

Bear in mind this is the most shorted stock of all time, but differences in free float change the share price differently.

Kodak went from **$2.16 to $33.2**

Volkswagen went from **\~200 euro to nearly 1000.**

Overstock went from **\~$21 to $123**

Blue apron went from **$2.31 to $18**

Ive been seeing some estimated that 1 million shares is roughly a dollars move in share price. This maths is about to be pretty autistic so bear with me degnerates.

$1 now is 2.81% of the share price. Everything in the markets is exponential and based on percentages. So if we assume a full squeeze of ortexs estimated short interest (This assumes no sell off and no new shorts, new shorts can be positive or negative depedning on when in the squeeze they happen) **$35.5 \* 1.0281\^77 = $299.** GME to moon. üåë .

This shit can happen. Hold on.

**GME has squeezed and been manipulated before and it always happens around the console cycles. Shorts never win and they wont win now.**

&#x200B;

[This post right here I found months ago and got me in the squeeze from the honourable and valiant u\/Uberkikz aka Rod Alzman](https://preview.redd.it/4ysv7bzclwb61.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=27ac6ac58b6366f81b53fa75966733b8a8d61d3c)

Basically the crayon chart shows green (outstanding shares) orange ( short shares) purple (Market cap) and cyan (Share price). In 2006-2008 the share price rose in tandem with short interest ( Like now ) Until console releases when you can see an abrupt squeeze happend mooning the share price.

This happend to a degree in 2013 with the xbox one but worse conditions for the company and a worse console launch lead to slow short covering but the share price still mooned.

Now we get to the best part. History is repeating itself for the third time and the shares sold short are literally higher than the outstanding shares, which have been decreasing since 2010. Short shares are also at the highest point ever and GME hasnt had a brighter future, well ever. Ps5 and Xbox Series X. are the two most hyped consoles since the Ps2. This is setting up the foundations for massive price movements weve never seen before. This shit has literally never happend, ever. Uncharted waters and we are the captain.

**For the insurmountably retarded autists who think that the squeeze has happend look upon this and despair:**

IHOR IS A MEGA WIZARD

Ihor I quote:

>**A long-buying tsunami ... is the primary factor for the price move**

Ihor Dusaniwsky is managing director of predictive analytics at S3 a firm similar to ortex. He told bloomberg that the squeeze hasnt happend yet and that this was long buying. If someone knows this shit its him. He was talking about the tesla squeeze in january 2020. He has access to resources we can only imagine. Barrons cut his comment that the squeeze hasnt happend yet out it was that fucking bullish. All the media ramming down ""Short squeeze has happend"" down peoples throats because bears are fucking scared.

The bots on stocktwits spamming bearish sentiment should show how rattled they are.

Edit: **You fucking degens just enlightened me that cramer pump is real, funds are ruminating over the long weekend, and stmmy bills pumps stonks and that stimmy bill buys many an xbox. See you at andromeda! Also more rockets.**

>There‚Äôs also the chance of a ratings upgrade. Moody‚Äôs and S&P have GME at B3 and B-, which is rated ‚Äúhighly speculative‚Äù. Ratings are reviewed every quarter, and a review might be due this month (i.e. this coming week or next). Good chance that the agencies might upgrade GME to a B2/B, or even better to the next higher band (Ba/BB).

2021-02-12 11:40:50,BlackBerry is NOT a Meme Stock,"It seems like people are finally starting to realize that BlackBerry, in fact, **is NOT a meme stock.**

You might ask, why is that? Well, here are a few of their partnerships and products that they're developing (and have *already* developed):

* Partnership with Amazon: On December 1st, [BB announced a multi-year agreement ](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform#:~:text=OverviewContact%20Us-,AWS%20and%20BlackBerry%20Join%20Forces%20to%20Accelerate,New%20Intelligent%20Vehicle%20Data%20Platform&amp;amp;amp;amp;text=SEATTLE%2C%20WA%20and%20WATERLOO%2C%20ON,%2C%20Amazon%20Web%20Services%2C%20Inc.)with AWS, which is Amazon‚Äôs cloud service business. The agreement plans to develop and market BlackBerry's Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform, IVY. BlackBerry IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud. Automakers can use this information to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences.
* Partnership with Baidu: On January 25, BB announced the [expansion](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology) of its strategic partnership with [Baidu](http://iv.baidu.com/), whose high-definition maps will run on the [QNX¬Æ Neutrino¬Æ Real-time](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-neutrino-rtos) Operating System (RTOS) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of [GAC Group](https://www.gac-motor.com/) (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.). The milestones build on the company‚Äôs [January 2018](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/blackberry-and-baidu-partnering-to-accelerate-connected-and-autonomous-vehicle-technology) agreement to make BlackBerry QNX's industry-leading operating system (OS) the foundation for Baidu's ‚ÄòApollo‚Äô autonomous driving open platform.
* BlackBerry QNX: BlackBerry is entering into the auto industry by using their QNX real-time operating system that is already built into over 175 million vehicles today and is already being used by automakers like Audi, BMW, Subaru, Volkswagen, GM, Toyota, and Honda. NVIDIA is even building its AI self-driving platform off of BlackBerry‚Äôs QNX technology.
* BlackBerry IVY: [In addition to the QNX](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/investors-overreacting-blackberry-deal-with-amazon/) Operating System, their partnership with AWS allows them to store all of this vehicle data through BlackBerry Ivy, which is a cloud-based software platform that allows these automakers to view data and insights for their vehicles.
* BlackBerry Spark: Another major service that BlackBerry offers is its Unified Endpoint Security, which is a comprehensive security approach to endpoint security that is essential to protect against and remediate cyber threats while providing visibility across all endpoints. Through their UES, they plan on improving **cross-platform visibility, cyber threat prevention, and remediation,** while **simplifying administration.**

**Okay, so why is this important?**

1. BlackBerry QNX was created to expand and improve autonomous driving vehicles and is currently being used in over 175 *million* vehicles.
2. BlackBerry IVY helps these automakers (Audi, BMW, Ford, etc) view data and insights on their vehicles. This means that if there is a recall on a vehicle, even like a problem with the sensors, **the automakers can find that issue much faster and quite possibly even fix it through a software update.**
3. They are REVOLUTIONIZING the automobile industry because of these two products. \*\*In the future, we could see a shift from hardware-driven vehicles to software-defined vehicles.\*\*
4. Not only are they focusing on this, but they also have successfully created cybersecurity software that received the **HIGHEST score in the industry for the Enterprise** [**Unmanaged/BYO use case**](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/09/blackberry-achieves-highest-score-in-gartner-critical-capabilities-report-for-unmanaged-byo-use-case)**.**

Gartner Research (who published the study) even placed BlackBerry higher than VMWare, IBM, and MSFT basically signaling that their products and services are better than their competitors. In fact, NONE of BlackBerry's customers that use BlackBerry Guard were affected by the SolarWinds hack. And the stock price is still $12.

**The Sobering Part of this DD:**

After taking a look at their balance sheet, I can agree with the skeptics that they‚Äôre not raking in a ton of money right now, but anyone can see that their current balance sheet makes the company appear to be undervalued, especially when compared to their competitors.

I mean, based on this information ALONE, the price of the stock should be much higher than it is right now. BlackBerry's current market cap is around $7 billion, with its competitors like Palantir, a software company that I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard other YouTubers talk about, hovering at 60 billion. And funny enough, Palantir is also focusing their software on electric vehicles and cybersecurity, just like BlackBerry. **If BlackBerry had the same market cap as Palantir, its stock price would be $110.**

**Final Thoughts:**

Here‚Äôs what the skeptics don‚Äôt realize though. They don‚Äôt realize that BB is still very focused on product development and customer acquisition, and that boomers probably still think it‚Äôs a phone company. Well, it‚Äôs not.

With their partnership with Amazon, Baidu, their UES and UEM product known as BlackBerry Spark, BlackBerry IVY, and their QNX operating system for vehicles, it seems like the market is not correctly pricing in BlackBerry‚Äôs **future growth**.

Maybe one day if BlackBerry receives the same amount of hype that Palantir is getting right now, maybe then it‚Äôll be taken much more seriously. **But only, once people realize that it‚Äôs not a meme stock.**

EDIT: Well, WSB mods have banned me for linking my video. Oh well.

EDIT 2: By the grace of u/DeepFuckingValue, mods reduced my sentence for being a good boy.

Also, I forgot to mention this: to all the retards out there saying ‚ÄúBB is not PLTR‚Äù lemme let you in on something.

**BlackBerry‚Äôs Fiscal 2020 Revenue: $1.1B**
**Palantir‚Äôs Fiscal 2020 Revenue: $1.05B (ESTIMATE)**

**Palantir Market Cap: $55.6B**

2021-02-13 20:00:52,MVIS: Shiny Laser Go Pew ‚ö° No But Seriously They Are Gonna Take Over The LiDAR Industry,"So, the day has come, and MicroVision's market cap is finally big enough so that you won't get banned for mentioning it on WSB. But what is it? Why have they seen an 800%+ increase in three months? Where are they headed? Allow me to explain.

**About Them**

MicroVision, Inc. (MVIS) makes futuristic-as-fuck laser technology that's used in self driving cars and augmented reality headsets. This already sets them apart from a major competitors like Velodyne (VLDR), which focuses solely on LiDAR for self driving cars.

Sumit Sharma, the CEO, was head of operations at Google's Project GLASS and has worked to map hardware development at Motorola, also worked at Jawbone.[ Source](https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/brooklinerunner?challengeId=AQG9ZZGeKX9VWgAAAXec1fLslGoC7UaTFwCgduU3ajjeIw_gMofulYMLCHKxKwfCHu5xLOoDIeF-4bS-FWdNj62xNtLfDVTmBQ&submissionId=a9151f8a-df64-6316-dda0-24150063286d)

Why have they been increasing 800% in three months while similar companies in the same sector see a fraction of that gain?

**Because their tech is much more advanced than the competition, and they were (are) criminally undervalued.**

The reason they're so undervalued is because the first thing hedge funds see when they research a potential investment is the balance sheet, and on paper MVIS looks like shit. (Low assets, high liabilities) Even I saw the movement back in December, did some research, and was like ""Wtf is this? I need to get puts"" But once you do research into their product, who their customers are, and the future of the industry that they are involved in, you see that MicroVision is a turnaround story similar to that of Plug Power; both are 90's futuristic companies that people got way too excited about in 2000, have struggled to make it to 2020, but now are about to finally have their heyday. And they got a $13 million [equity facility (loan) in December](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/29/2151422/0/en/MicroVision-Announces-13-Million-At-the-Market-Equity-Facility.html) that greatly improved their balance sheet, making them appeal to institutions, and bringing [Vanguard](https://fintel.io/so/us/mvis/vanguard-group) and [Blackrock to invest](https://fintel.io/so/us/mvis/blackrock) in MVIS days later. I actually had a hedge fund manager tell me that MVIS was doomed to run out of cash in Q1 2020, but if they secured funds then they would have a lot of potential. I go over that in the comments.

[ MVIS \(left\) vs PLUG \(right\) 1990's until present ](https://preview.redd.it/803a6oge9dh61.png?width=1868&format=png&auto=webp&s=d889603b5691f3b12126c5807db5752804598a63)

Anyways, what is this ""much more advanced"" technology? I'll just let this chart do the talking:

[ The MicroVision Consumer LIDAR being compared here isn't even their model designed for self-driving cars, that will be coming in April.](https://preview.redd.it/c3zdfgwh9dh61.png?width=1446&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae8c428f74846c15e06c16c0bbdf270a9fcb9bf8)

The resolution it can take as input/second, the points per second, is key when it comes to how clearly the LiDAR sensor can see, how accurately it can identify what it is seeing, and how quickly it can react.

That chart is from 2 years ago and *still* the best resolution Velodyne can provide today is only 4,800,000 pps in their most advanced model, the ""[Alpha Prime](https://velodynelidar.com/downloads/?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)""

>3D Lidar Data Points Generated 2- Single Return Mode: \~ 2,400,000 points per second- Dual Return Mode: \~ 4,800,000 points per second.

VLDR has not publicly announced a price for their Alpha Prime yet, but historically their top of the line devices cost[ $75,000](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055011/lidar-sensor-self-driving-mainstream-mass-market-velodyne-ces-2020). I have seen unsourced numbers of the Alpha Prime[ costing $100,000.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LiDAR/comments/emp7h4/where_to_get_a_used_velodyne_alpha_prime_vls128/fdqguty?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) That was last year, will probably be brought down to be more reasonable for automakers to purchase. They did [announce a $500 model](https://www.forbes.com/sites/samabuelsamid/2020/11/13/velodyne-announces-500-velarray-h800-lidar-production-in-2021/?sh=4a37f2246e8f) called the Velarray H800 in November, but the only thing they said about its pps resolution is that its [""outstanding""](https://velodynelidar.com/press-release/velodyne-lidar-unveils-breakthrough-solid-state-lidar-sensor/)... lol.

As for Luminar (LAZR),[ they will launch the new model ""Iris"" in 2022, which will cost about $1,000:](https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/luminar-eyes-production-vehicles-with-100m-round-and-new-iris-lidar-platform/) (the[ same price](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microvision-inc-announces-progress-automotive-210500945.html) as MicroVision's device to be revealed in April). It will also only operate at 10Hz. This is similar to playing a racing game at 10FPS. If you know anything about video games, you know that **this is unplayable.**

>Iris will cost less than $1,000 per unit for production vehicles seeking serious autonomy, and for $500 you can get a more limited version for more limited purposes like driver assistance, or ADAS. Luminar says Iris is 'slated to launch commercially on production vehicles beginning in 2022,' but that doesn't mean necessarily that it's shipping to customers right now. The company is negotiating more than a billion dollars in contracts at present, a representative told me, and 2022 would be the earliest that vehicles with Iris could be made available.

A[ lengthy post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/k7bzrk/race_to_mass_production_luminar_lazr_vs/) has been make comparing Luminar's resolutions with MicroVision's, which was not easy to calculate because Luminar said their resolution was ""300dpi/spdeg"", a statistic that is incomprehensible for shareholders because its not the common specification of millions (3D) points per second. Here's the math, I sum it all up at the bottom:

>Luminar's Hydra claims resolution of ""**up to** 200 points per square degree"" and a FOV of 120¬∞ x 30¬∞ (degrees). (and 300 points for Iris, the one coming in 2022.)

>However, the vertical FOV can be configured from 1¬∞ to 30¬∞ , which likely explains the use of ""up to"" in the resolution numbers. Generally, as FOV expands, resolution shrinks, assuming a constant pixel stream. This is why Alex Kipman made such a big deal about MSFT maintaining resolution in Hololens 2(YT links aren't allowed apparently) while expanding FOV because it required more pixels to do so.  
>  
>Specifically, regarding Luminar, is 200 points per square degree available when FOV is at the maximum 120¬∞ x 30¬∞? Or is it available only at a lesser FOV such as, for example, 120¬∞ x 5¬∞? The use of ""up to"" suggests the latter.  
>  
>Even assuming 200 points per square degree at 120¬∞ x 30¬∞ is available, which is not conceded given the stated ""up to"", that would yield a total resolution of 720,000 points. MVIS claims capacity in excess of 20M points per second. At a resolution of 720,000 points, Luminar would require a frame rate of 27.7 Hz to equal 20M points per second. Luminar's specs do not suggest that its technology is capable of such a high frame rate at this resolution. This is not surprising given it does not use MEMS micromirrors but something more ""mechanical"" including, as per a recent patent,[ spindles and a drive belt](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10310058B1/en?oq=US10310058B1)  
>  
>(1) At video time **19:56**, Luminar compares the specs of its Iris product to industry requirements. The graphic reveals that Luminar's 2022 production lidar, **Iris**, will support resolution of **300 points per square degree at 10 Hz**. Assuming that resolution applies to the entire FOV of 120 x 30 degrees and not just a portion of the FOV, that would imply a points per second value of 120 x 30 x 300 x 10 Hz = **10.8M points per second**. If the 300 points/ sq. deg applies only to a smaller FOV, the points per second figure would be proportionally smaller. Microvision claims **20M points per second** for its current MEMS lidar. The company also advises that its technology is capable of more than 20M points/sec.

TLDR: The best case scenario for Luminar is that their 2022 model will have 10.8 million pps, but in reality its probably much lower than that because of FOV configurations, careful wording by press releases, and Hz limitations. Additional Interesting insight on Luminar and their tech lagging behind is in the comments, this post is long enough already.

Again the [MicroVision Consumer LIDAR](http://www.microvision.com/consumer-lidar/?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) ([specifications](http://www.microvision.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MEMS-Based-3D-LiDAR-Engine-Product-Brief.pdf?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) being used for comparison here isn't even their model designed for self-driving cars. Their device specialized for cars, the ""1st gen Long Range LiDAR (LRL) Sensor"",[ will be coming in April](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microvision-inc-announces-progress-automotive-210500945.html).

>We expect our 1st generation LRL Sensor to have range of at least 250 meters and the highest resolution at range of any lidar with 340 vertical lines up to 250 meters, 568 vertical lines up to 120 meters and 944 vertical lines up to 60 meters. This **equates** **to** 520 points per square degree.

(For those who read the math on LAZR, notice he doesn't say **up to**)

It testing is successful, the 1st Generation LRL Sensor will be able to calculate velocity of objects relative to itself, and be able to be used in Level 3 and Level 4 self-driving applications

>Our LRL Sensor will also output velocity of moving objects relative to an ego vehicle across our dynamic field of view in real-time 30 Hz sensor output. This sensor would accelerate development of Level 3 (L3) autonomous safety and Level 4 (L4) autonomous driving features that are important to potential customers and interested parties.

What is Level 3 and Level 4 autonomous driving?

Level 1 is feet off, level 2 is hands off, level 3 is eyes off, level 4 is mind off, and level 5 is full passenger (you can sit in the back). So basically, they have that 2045 technology **today**, while everyone else is trying to play catch-up. How is it so advanced? It all lies in the high resolution of the laser sensors.

If their devices can really recognize people, objects, and pets, it could integrate security verticals in MicroVision's business model. ([Video surveillance is expected to reach a 144.5 B market size by 2027](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/video-surveillance-market-size-is-expected-to-reach-usd-144-85-billion-by-2027---valuates-reports-301056561.html#:~:text=The%20global%20IP%20video%20surveillance,CAGR%20from%202019%20to%202026)) Why not just use cameras?[ Cameras are worse at long distances](https://www.techbriefs.com/component/content/article/tb/stories/blog/37699),

**Growing Industry**

The self-driving cars market[ is expected to reach 220.44 billion](https://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/self-driving-cars-market) dollars by 2025. This includes taxi, civil, public transport, heavy duty trucks, ride shares, and ride hail (UBER - 72 B mkt cap) applications.

Traffic Accidents ***in the US alone*** [Cost 871 Billion A Year](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/motor-vehicle-crashes-u-s-cost-871-billion-year-federal-study-finds#:~:text=federal%2Dstudy%2Dfinds-,Traffic%20accidents%20in%20the%20U.S.%20cost,a%20year%2C%20federal%20study%20finds&text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%94%20The%20economic%20and%20societal,National%20Highway%20Traffic%20Safety%20Administration), even just yesterday there was an[ insane pileup](https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/traffic/traffic-updates-overnight-sleet-turns-north-texas-roads-into-sheets-of-ice/2548822/) on the I-35W highway in Texas that killed 6, injured 36, and damaged 133 vehicles.

Not only self-driven cars need LiDAR. In a few years, as soon as MicroVision's 1st Gen LRL is available, LiDAR systems will certainly become mandatory for (still) human-controlled cars to avoid collisions. This tech could become as revolutionary and successful as airbags.[ Airbags are a 37.3 billion dollar industry](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/airbag-market#:~:text=Global%20Airbag%20Market%20is%20expected,and%20deflate%20after%20the%20accident).

If only 10% of the[ cars produced](https://www.statista.com/statistics/262747/worldwide-automobile-production-since-2000/) annually contain four Microvision LRL systems, this will result in a volume of 364 million units in ten years. (9.1 million cars \* 4 modules \* 10 years) And this is a conservative calculation, both a higher market share, more cars produced, and more modules per car are conceivable.

This index also outperforms the Russel 1000 and the S&P 500.

Their intellectual property includes in-house developed custom MEMS, custom optics, proprietary digital and analog silicon chips, embedded real-time firmware and software, manufacturing processes, custom automation and strategic partnerships that allow them to operate in a sleek model.

MicroVision patents and products therefore serve many future markets:

Whoever has the MicroVision technology may be able to eliminate the competition or demand license fees from them. Or the other way around: Whoever does not buy the technology can be excluded from markets. Therefore, bidding competition may arise to gain access to the market. Whoever has the best LiDAR system for cars will also be able to supply other components and software to car manufacturers. The car manufacturer who has the best LiDAR system has a big advantage over the competition.

MVIS at 2.77B

MicroVision offers a quantitatively much higher performance product than both of its competitor companies. Because of their lack of focus on augmented reality technologies, competitors are not likely to have a future in the markets of smart glasses, healthcare, engineering, military equipment, GPS safety, entertainment, and interactive projectors. They are involved in an industry that is currently at an inflection point, due to grow massively in the near future. Their high number of extremely advanced patents will bring in significant revenue for the company in the coming years. I have never seen a company with such low insider selling, that the last case of a sale was in 2014.

&#x200B;

[This article from BBG](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-04/the-only-thing-outpacing-tesla-are-its-10-000-option-winnings?sref=C5KKabzI) sparked a kind of retard frenzy. Particularly this part:

>There‚Äôs an element of circularity at play, but this activity may be contributing to the rally in the shares. **When a trader buys a call, the dealer who sells it will typically buy a certain amount of stock in the underlying to offset their exposure. If the shares continue to rise, dynamically managing that hedge can entail increasing purchases.**  
>  
>‚ÄúSo, now you get the picture, that every day **at the open lately, folks are grabbing call options quickly and driving the stocks/indexes higher,‚Äù** writes Scott Murray of Volatility Analytics. ‚ÄúIt is much easier for this kind of market to be unhinged, as long call holders‚Äô corresponding dealer position is long the underlying.‚Äù

So /r/wsb thinks it discovered the holy grail, because it learned that sellers of options hedge their delta.

u/SuXs, managed to distinguish himself from the imbecile masses of the subreddit, by appearing to truly believe that if he manages to convince some people to buy $200 MSFT calls, the dealers will buy enough shares to offset their delta to make a $1tn stock rally.

Just check out his recent submission history - reads like a strong CV for a position of a full retard: [https://i.imgur.com/x3T544x.png](https://i.imgur.com/x3T544x.png)

I left the Bear Gang post there on purpose as a cherry on top of this pile of pure idiocy.

News flash - delta hedging becomes a factor when a stock goes up 20% in a day. Or 100% in a month.  Not when you place a $100k (let's be generous) order for $200 MSFT calls. Also, while TSLA can conceivably go to $1000 or $1200 or $700 over the next week, those kinds of moves are not in cards for MSFT - hence even less need to aggressively delta hedge.

MSFT is a solid company. But today, I sincerely hope it totally shits the bed or else you dumb motherfuckers will really believe that by having 20 guys spend $300 each on an OTM call you can make the share price of a $1tn company go up.

BTW buying OTM calls at the open has nothing to do with HFT spoofing of orders that Navinder Sarao got busted for. That guy was just flashing a huge order on the bid side to move the market marginally up (and opposite for ask side). He never intended for those orders to be filled, so he was quickly cancelling them after getting the desired effect.

* In plane English:  The FTC is worried that during the last decade, FAAAM used HSR to squash competition before it could arise and take over the world.  A easy example of expansion: Amazon buying a bunch of small manufacturing companies so they suddenly have the infrastructure to produce Amazon Basics, products designed to compete with everyday needs.  An example of competition: Facebook buying a small social media company worth 50 Mil that could have easily grown into an Instagram competitor.

Current analysis is that BlackBerry is starting to rise in value ""on the street."" And NOT just WallStreetBets... Here's some of the more interesting reasons why I think BB is sorely undervalued...

First let's take a look quickly at what BlackBerry IS NOT...

&#x200B;

\* They are not a cat! (sorry DFV)

\* They are NOT a ""phone company.""

\* They are NOT, however, totally ""out of the phone business."" As early as June 2018, BB had made some interesting BlackBerry Key 2 phones for the international markets, and the Evolve and Evolve X had been licensed for the market in India by Optiemus Infracom.

&#x200B;

This last point is MOST interesting. Here's why...

&#x200B;

Though BB had sold most of their phone patents to Huawei, their licensee Optiemus Infracom (founded in 1993, I might add) seems to be a VERY strong player in the Indian market. Though the phone systems have seemingly been abandoned, or sold, by BlackBerry, there's ONE bit of VERY important news that isn't getting through:

""As of 2019, BlackBerry Limited stated that only technical support will be offered for the Indonesian devices built by the company. Additionally, the operational status of Optiemus is unknown as of September 2020, as there have not been updates posted from them in regards to BlackBerry in India since 2018.""

This last bit of information is MOST interesting! Did BB decide to intentionally hide this bit of info from the rest of the investing world? Did they think that their PR machine needed to NOT mention this fact to investors and shareholders? COULD BB at some point surprise the market with a new brand of phone?

&#x200B;

Okay, so India... It's a country on the ""other side of the world,"" why should we care?

&#x200B;

It is the second-most populous country, the seventh-largest country by land area, and the most populous democracy in the world. Cool geographic facts, but HOW BIG IS THIS MARKET? With a fifth of the world's population, it's current population is 1,389,308,662 as of March 10, 2021... Not much to really explain at length here...

Though BB DID ""officially"" declare as of September 28, 2016, it would cease designing its own phones in favor of licensing to partners. TCL Communication became the global licensee of the brand, under the name ""BlackBerry Mobile.""

&#x200B;

Now, what does this have to do with the ""validity"" of BB? This last bit of interesting info makes for a rather brow-raising piece of info:

A few weeks prior to the expiration of TCL Corporation's global license expiration for the BlackBerry brand, it was announced that Texas start-up OnwardMobility has acquired a license to make 5G devices for the brand beginning in 2021. Unlike for the partnership with TCL, OnwardMobility will be making the devices for the enterprise market, with manufacturing partner FIH Mobile.

Looks like BB is still involved in the overseas market. You can see just how far this company has reached!!

&#x200B;

Enough about the phones and speculation for the future of another BB phone, let's talk about the more recent events (besides WSB ""liking the stock"") for a minute...

BlackBerry has been in the healthcare market for some time...

In December 2014, BlackBerry and NantHealth, a healthcare-focused data provider, launched a secure cancer genome browser, giving doctors the ability to access patients' genetic data on the BlackBerry Passport smartphone!

Sheesh, I didn't know that!

Here's something interesting from the company's own website that caught my eye:

""38,000+ patents

18 major development centers in 7 countries

I wonder how many patents were sold off to Huawei.

&#x200B;

NINETY...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

You gotta be %$%&# kidding me?!?!? Out of 30 THOUSAND patents, only 90 were sold?!??

I'll let you ponder that point for a minute...

&#x200B;

So, we all know about BB's involvement in other countries, but what about here at home?

But wait, what about those other 30 something thousand patents, what are those?

Well, according to a Reuters article from January 12th of this year, those are:

""which include cybersecurity and building computer operating systems for cars.""

CARS... So BlackBerry COULD find itself on the cutting edge of EV and Self driving car technology!

&#x200B;

Now, I would be amiss if I didn't address ALL sides of this statement, and this is the BIG one for me, though not a total failure. Read on...

Articles from 2014 and 2016 point to Ford Motors using BlackBerry's QNX operating system in the new version of its Sync in-car communication and entertainment system, instead of Microsoft Corp.‚Äôs (MSFT) Windows, which it uses currently. One might wonder WHY the Microsoft system was steadily being abandoned by Ford...

Ha ha! Windows jokes abound I'm sure in this one, but quite simply put, the shift is being induced by numerous reported malfunctions in Ford‚Äôs current technology systems and touch screens.

So what happened this year? Ford decided to go with Android for it's future in car technologies. It's a Route One financial observer (affiliated with Cnet) noted, with automakers continuing to follow in Ford's footsteps, most notable with Volvo and it's cousin division Polestar.

Two things make this not TOTALLY bad news for BB, though this bit definitely affected BB price shares through most of the month of February (the news broke Feb 1st):

One, Ford didn't entirely detail what will make the partnership ""unique"" for drivers, but what will come to its cars in two years will be transformative.

Two, and most importantly, BB isn't TOTALLY out of the equation for Ford cars, since ""the Android software will also provide access to third-party developers who want a shot at creating apps specifically for the car. The automaker thinks it'll be what drivers increasingly want in the future: more customization and personalization in the car.""

So in a nutshell, BB COULD, theoretically, come up with apps designed to run off of the Android software that's going to be in these cars. It's funny how vague and murky the press release from Ford was without giving specifics to exactly HOW transformative this will be...

READ BETWEEN THE LINES....

&#x200B;

Finally, a few other noteworthy items this year to pay attention to...

As of June 2020, ""its QNX software is now embedded in more than 175 million cars on the road today."" That's a LOT of cars that will still be on the road for some time to come. In fact, if those are NEWER cars, those systems will probably still receive maintenance and updates/upgrades. (As opposed to, say, cars from 2000 - 2010.)

What sorts of cars are these systems in? That same article references... ""Automakers and Tier 1s use BlackBerry¬Æ QNX¬Æ software in their advanced driver assistance, digital instrument clusters, connectivity modules, handsfree, and infotainment systems that appear in car brands, including Audi, BMW, Ford, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, KIA, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Toyota, and Volkswagen.""

&#x200B;

Shit, we haven't talked about cyber security or software!!! Cars, cars, cars! Yes, EV and self driving cars ARE THE FUTURE, even if it is still 2, 5 or 10 years down the road...

One thing I've noticed; once companies get government contracts, unless they royally screw it up, they're usually around for good, and stock prices seem to reflect that. With the newest Microsoft cyber security threat, you can be damn sure that Cyber security companies will get their ""day in the sun."" This March 9th article is MOST compelling, and a reason why BB is setting itself up for the future...

""BlackBerry Limited today announced new technology advancements to BlackBerry AtHoc that will improve how U.S. Federal agencies communicate and collaborate during times of crisis, and reduce the risk of unauthorized access to Federal data, systems and applications.""

This is freakin' HUGE... ""BlackBerry AtHoc is trusted by government, military, commercial and humanitarian organizations around the world including over 70% of U.S. Federal Government employees."" This comes from BB's own website, and you gotta like the numbers... :)

&#x200B;

March brought a number of other announcements as well, which makes me think the prices of BB, though rising at this particular point in time, aren't rising high enough. From the March 8th article stating ""BlackBerry Limited announced that it has teamed up with Desay S.V. Automotive to launch a dual-screen virtual smart cabin domain controller to enable safer driving. Leveraging the QNX Hypervisor and the QNX Real-time Operating System (RTOS), the new technology is now available in leading Chinese automaker Chery‚Äôs Tiggo 8 Plus and Jetour X90 models.""

to the March 15th article about introducing Next-Gen critical event management for the commercial sector, it appears readily obvious that BlackBerry isn't resting on it's laurels.

Add to that third quarter fiscal 2021 total Company non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, a high standard of measuring companies' financials here in the U.S.) revenue of $224 million, $757 million of cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments at November 30, 2020, AND having 19th consecutive quarter of positive non-GAAP operating income, and you see a company that has effective money management.

&#x200B;

However, all that being said, BlackBerry currently has a Return On Equity of 21.22 percent, which is somewhat high in the index, but when compared to companies like Microsoft (42.7%), Google (19%) and Amazon (27.44%), sounds like it should be even MORE of a bargain. Let me say, though that I'm not 100% sold on using ROE as a sole indicator of a stock's value...

All in all I love the stock and believe in this company's future... Thanks for sitting with me through my first ever attempt at providing due diligence on a company... It was rather fun to dive into this company's history and outlook for the future.

2021-02-12 23:00:16,$TSLA is positioned for a massive reversal,"Tesla's current market cap is the result of multiple positive feedback loops which has pushed its price to a ludicrous level via Short + Gamma Squeezes (it is also important to note virtually all TSLA shorts are out^(1)). This campaign has been largely led by large hedge funds. Without S&P inclusion, the story might have ended there with hedge funds trying to escape with their profits and leaving retail the bag. However, S&P inclusion presented these hedge funds with a much better option to close out their positions while also riding the stock down. The shares that hedge funds no longer wanted began to be picked up by passive funds leading to selloffs by the active funds which pushed prices to this level.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n6fgihd1y6h61.png?width=1482&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5d3bf5499e500fd3b23914d36a8f7ab0f145767

With passive funds holding the bag, the hedge funds which lead the rally seem to be attempting to push the price back down through a reverse gamma squeeze^(2).

No retail trader is buying 1m+ in deep OTM puts, this is an attempt by hedgies to push the price down.

We can also see this from the massive shift in options volume. $190B of calls open interest and over $250B of puts open interest, a massive put skew. This is especially significant because ""To put it in context it is equal to the combined $AAPL and $AMZN bullish skew or if you‚Äôd rather to the combined  $BABA, $FB, $MSFT, $GOOG and $WMT combined."" reflecting extremely bearish sentiment in an very very bullish market.

Once the reversal begins there will be nothing stopping it as OTM puts get less and less OTM. There are no shorts left to be squeezed and the bag holding passive funds which are largely barred from holding derivatives will have no way of rebalancing the options skew.

2021-02-22 20:08:25,I think PLTR is invincible rn and in the long run.,"So... this could be a bit long, but let me double down  on my thoughts on PLTR. Recently, we‚Äôve seen a little turmoil in the broader market that has scared some growth investors, and I do think there is some justifiable fear.

A lot of folks are going to tell you this is a great discount on names like TSLA or PLUG, and I certainly don‚Äôt disagree with them- I just want to have all my bases covered.

Now we have seen some structural shifts in the broader market. The 10-Year shift up to 1.35% is a noticable tick up, and this is something all of us ü¶ç have to be wary of.

As much as I like discounts, when the market prices in tighter money, the Fed will have to listen. I believe Uncle Jay will continue to have the market‚Äôs back, and I think the 10-Year should be capped at roughly 1.5-2%. We‚Äôll see how this develops, but the bottomline is these forward-looking growth giants are going to get CRUSHED if they miss expectations.

And well, if technology continues to be a deflationary pressure through innovation as we all expect, then üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ regardless and we can cap the discussion here.

So here‚Äôs where sweet good PLTR comes into play. I really, really like how they delivered earnings last week. Didn‚Äôt REALLY disappoint: beat earnings on a non-GAAP basis and had 45% annual top line growth.

But that‚Äôs not even the kicker for me. The fact that PLTR leadership is essentially guaranteeing at least 30% growth over the next 5 years (read the earnings call transcript), which will look like an absolute bonanza if rates actually start to go up.

Now, the thesis is that growth firms‚Äô future profits are less valuable today if rates start to go up, which would not be great for big growth names like PLTR. But then here‚Äôs the thing: it would absolutely WRECK mega tech growth like FAANG or the EV/battery state field.

Let‚Äôs go back to earnings. Karp and the PLTR team are essentially setting the bar very low, telling investors to sit back and expect ONLY 30% growth for 5+ years. (For boomers, they realize this is fucking crazy btw).

Essentially, if there is any surprise to the upside, which is totally reasonable with a disruptor like Palantir, and this thing will be worth hundreds of billions in the blink of an eye.

But think of how all these great stories came about. Tesla in 2017-2019. Facebook in 2012-2013. Apple in 2008-2009. These tech stars never had a straight shot up, and the same goes for PLTR.

They faced the same problems. I‚Äôm only a college student, but I remember for as long as I have been alive from skeptical financial analysts that Tesla was gargantually overvalued and didn‚Äôt have the cash to survive in the EV market.

I watched as a kid as some whiz built up a social media platform from his dorm room, but Wall St attacked him for wearing a hoodie to his IPO. Not only did they not think he could expand his platform from PC to mobile, but they questioned how its cutting edge technology differed from Myspace and Tumblr, and wondered if he could ever scale ad revenue. 
He shore could.

Yes, PLTR is overvalued. What isn‚Äôt? Snowflake trades for 80X estimated sales. C3.AI trades at 73.5X its 2020 revenues. Salesforce, Splunk, and MSFT ain‚Äôt cheap. 

(For reference, PLTR is trading just under 37X 2021 sales, which is lofty, but looks reasonable compared to these other names that have way higher multiples and much less sophisticated/scalable software).

And if we look at it... PLTR was profitable by roughly $0.06/share if you take out a stockholder compensation expense that otherwise would have left them with $100M+ in operating profit. 

Is it profitable? PLTR has 70% fucking margins. How are Finance pricks not creaming over this??? You want high margin/earnings- this is it right here, man.

But no, no, big bad overvalued Palantir want to pay executives/advisors/shareholders extra money. Bad. Bad- I say they worth $20 in equity research reports and on CNBC instead, but still load up behind the scenes ü§Æü§°.

Fuck the shills who say Palantir can‚Äôt continue robust growth or be profitable. (I am looking at your trend-seeking bots Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley).

On top of that, yes their revenue base is dominated by gov‚Äôt clients at roughly 52%, but let‚Äôs pause and realize this is a good thing. I mean... i don‚Äôt want to get too political here, but broadly, you‚Äôre a fool if you think the Dod, DoJ, or CDC/NIAID are cutting back anytime soon, if not looking to HEAVILY EXPAND given the monumental threats we face- geopolitical foes like China, Russia Iran; climate change; police reform; EV adoption/renewables more broadly; 5G and cloud/quantum computing, i really could keep going (amongst all of them, these agencies have dozens of contracts with PLTR worth hundreds of millions of $).

Not too mention PLTR also has massive contracts with numerous EU members and Asian allies like Japan/S. korea, but there‚Äôs honestly so many positive examples about how scalable this beauty is both domestically and internationally.

And let‚Äôs take what Cathie Wood said the other day on CNBC: roughly along the lines that some of the greatest innovations come from the military. I think we can point to the WWW as a pretty decent example of that.

Given PLTR traces its roots to the CIA‚Äôs venture capital arm and loading up on national security contracts with all the intelligence agencies after 9/11, I feel pretty confident that this lengthy history will continue providing much value in revenue AND earnings to PLTR, especially if rates starts to rise.

Furthermore, the cross that bogged Tesla, Apple, FB, and pretty much every mega cap tech company is restraining Palantir right now. The Street wonders if they will be able to continue locking down corporate clients, which it has been rapidly expanding in recent years.

The answer is yes. But Wall St doesn‚Äôt want you to think so at the moment. B/c PLTR was a direct listing, they weren‚Äôt underwritten by investment banks, and thus don‚Äôt receive the same financial shilling that names like Snowflake or C3.AI LITERALLY PAY FEES TO analysts/associates at bulge bracket banks to shill like a damn used ‚Äò98 Honda Accord (and that‚Äôs exactly what these other SAaS names are compared to PLTR)

But we always double down on our convictions. If you have seen Palantir‚Äôs demos, read its financials, or listened to their CEO, then you know the potential of this company.

I believe in people. I believe in Peter Thiel and his track record. I believe a guy who founded PayPal with Elon Musk, seeded Facebook when no one else would, and decided to seed PLTR w/ the CIA (when no one else would)- yes, I believe he knows what he is doing.

And I believe he is capable of finding talent like Alex Karp and collaborating with him to build an absolute behemoth.

As a conclusion, can someone give me a firm answer on a company that can actually compete with PLTR in terms of solving a complex issue like tracking down Osama Bin Laden or expanding a niche industry into international markets??? And if your only comment is on valuations, see Snowflake (quite the value investment Mr. Buffett ;).

For disclosure, I am very long PLTR and am simply sharing my thoughts. This is not financial advice. And as always, do your own reading/research, but these are the frank sentiments of a PLTR believer.

Now with the lock-up fucking history, PLTR TO THE MOON üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

2021-02-23 18:42:56,$PLTR Extensive DD Part 2: What Makes it Disruptive/Valuation,"Yesterday I posted a lengthy DD on Palantir Technologies ($PLTR), where I went in-depth on my evaluation of the firm's history, its financials, and why I believe the naysayers are wrong (Link included here:[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq8rw4/i\_think\_pltr\_is\_invincible\_rn\_and\_in\_the\_long\_run/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq8rw4/i_think_pltr_is_invincible_rn_and_in_the_long_run/) )-i do recommend reading this first, this post is meant to be a follow-up/supplement to my liking of this stock.

But I wanted to go more in-depth into just why I find this company so special and unique. As I mentioned in my DD last night, I am just a 19-year-old college student, not an investment banker or hotshot market maker, but I believe the information I have ascertained about Palantir by just scouring the web distinguishes it from any company on the planet (but we'll keep it strictly to the software industry in this DD).

What is truly unique about Palantir's software (Gotham, Foundry, Apollo) is how collaborative, scalable, and advanced it is. Let me break this down: Palantir's software is COLLABORATIVE b/c it meshes the company's clients' data into a mega cloud. For example, the LAPD, BP, JP Morgan, and top law firms all upload their data onto Palantir's cloud, where they can get insights into efficiency, efficacy, and receive suggestions from the advanced software on how to improve their venture (these guys are all PLTR clients btw), and particularly useful for say, defending an embassy or managing a supply chain.

Now, just to get it straight, there is no data/cloud that can come ANYWHERE close to the insights and knowledge on what Palantir has.  You might often hear from Wall Street research analysts/CNBC shills who complain that PLTR has too many rich clients (big companies/gov't). But I think what boomers don't understand is that building your foundation amongst the biggest fish in the sea is quite the ADVANTAGE, not a weakness.

Let me use an example from our beloved Cathie Wood and her firm Ark Invest's large position in Tesla extremely quickly (I promise). When asked about how she felt about Tesla's performance in the autonomous driving space compared to competitors like Waymo (owned by Google), she commented last year that **having a vast collection of data** would separate those who succeed from those who attempt. As a reference, Tesla cars all transmit self-driving data back to the firm, which comes about through the many Tesla owners who drive all over the world. On the other hand, Waymo is committed to private testing stages only, which is shallow-minded b/c it doesn't have access to trial data on say, congested roads.

Back to PLTR. The reason I bring up the Waymo-Tesla-Ark example is to highlight just how many clients PLTR's revenue base represents, and how impactful that is on a company's growth, scalability, and ultimately, the *success of their product*. But I mean when you think about it, Palantir's clientele is the **ENTIRE GLOBAL ECONOMY/SOCIETY**. Go to the *Financial Times*, and try to find me an article that doesn't talk up Palantir's greatness in the U.K and their work helping NIH. EU members like Greece/France also use it for COVID vaccine tracking. Palantir has contracts with the Japanese/South Korean governments. Palantir has notably helped the U.S. catch infamous cucks like Osama Bin Laden to Bernie Madoff. Quite the diversity!

The reason for that entire BJ to Palantir right there is to illustrate just how extensive this scale is. Not only is all this data accessible RIGHT NOW to all these clients to collaborate on Palantir's platform, but is comprised of the single most dominant and sustainable institutions/enterprises in the world. No matter how the political winds blow or how the global/domestic economy winds up, you can count on 3M, the DoD, Ferrari- to name a few- to continue seeking ways to scale, grow, expand, and Palantir certainly is the way.

This gets back to another central, bulletproof thesis surrounding Palantir. Who are its competitors? Who can do what Palantir does? 

Let's start with Snowflake. All credit to their talented team, Warren Buffett, and their gang of bulge bracket banks who underwrote their IPO and cheerlead the stock on media outlets on the daily. But for lack of a better word, their software just isn't *dope* enough. I mean the UI contrast speaks for itself, but the intelligence is what matters here. Yes, data warehousing is no joke and is certainly a scalable business, but what kind of innovative insights can you draw from just essentially a digital warehouse that doesn't add any value? All Snowflake really is is Salesforce dressed up in pretty bells and whistles. Really makes me question Buffett's whole commitment to ""value.""

[C3.AI](https://C3.AI) at least has me interested. It seems like a real knock-off version of Palantir based on what I can ascertain from their public materials, but so what? A bunch of washed-up junkies from Oracle think they can lead the transition to AI? Compared to a company that was seeded in 2003 specifically to work with the CIA and other intelligence agencies after 9/11 (PLTR also called the ""gold standard"" by these agencies according to *TechCrunch*), why waste your time in [C3.AI](https://C3.AI) or Snowflake? Don't even get make me started on Splunk, IBM (who conceded they suck by signing on w/ PLTR last week), or MSFT.

And while we're at it, let's talk about valuations to drive the point home. According to the *Financial Times,* PLTR is valued at a $48B market cap and is trading at 34X 2021 estimated sales. To start, yes that is very lofty, even after accounting for the recent sell-off due to earnings/lock-up fears. But I'll pick on my prime targets, SNOW and AI, if we can even call them competitors (we'll be nice). SNOW has just under an $80B market cap, but is trading at 80x 2021 estimated sales! AI is trading at a $15B market cap, and is trading at 70.5x 2020 estimated sales!! That's fucking crazy, and Buffett should sell SNOW immediately if he cares about value (or he just doesn't understand technology).

Since the whole speculation is going to be about earnings in the next few years, let's talk about that. As I mentioned in my DD yesterday, PLTR reported EPS of $0.06/share on a non-GAAP basis, which is TRIPLE what the street predicted!! But thanks to a $100M stockholder compensation expense, the GAAP basis was a loss of $0.02/share, and Wall ST took the opportunity to AMBUSH PLTR. 

If you understand how business development works, these incentives are necessary in the early stages of a company. How else do you expect to attract top talent to the company and incentivize existing brains to stay? But as you grow into your valuations, like PLTR will, why do you need to do it? (PLTR has essentially promised 30% + growth for 5+ years, and earnings are on the way this year thanks to their earnings report). Who does Apple need to incentivize to stay? Wall St is simply trying to make something out of nothing.

I also mentioned PLTR was a direct-listing yesterday, unlike any of these other names here. If you don't know what that means, basically PLTR didn't have its IPO underwritten by banks or pay them massive fees in the process. So equity research, investment banking, asset management, and other areas of lucrative finance have no incentive to talk up PLTR (just Jeffries it seems for now).

And this is what I mean. Again as I mentioned yesterday, it happens with all megacap tech companies. Think about it as evolution. Facebook. Apple. Tesla. Google. Microsoft. These guys weren't oversubscribed by the money makers either, nor were they cheaply valued either. But by the time the robust top line translated into earnings, these firms were worth hundreds of billions of $ with the snap of your fingers, which is exactly what will happen with Palantir (we are already seeing this- their institutional ownership nearly doubled from 12% in January to 21% right now).

This is what I want you all to think about. As a disclosure, I am very long PLTR (you can view my positions on yesterday's DD), but irregardless of whether you will invest in it or not, read about Palantir Technologies. This is the company of the future: able to tailor its cutting-edge technology to all the intricate challenges the 21st century projects: climate change, further space exploration, geopolitical/nuclear tensions, renewable energy adoption, inequality, police reform, and so much more, while providing a platform for all these parties to collaborate and improve. Given the world is an ever expanding place, and the dominant players are already seated at the table, I could not feel more relieved or excited than to have all my chips in the one waiter who will serve them all.

\*\***This is not financial advice. I recommend you read up on PLTR, pour through its financials, and hear more from its CEO, Alex Karp, and Chairman, Peter Thiel- then make your own informed, balanced, intelligent, rational decision. Without a doubt, this will be** ***the*** **company being discussed in the decades to come, and I just want to expedite the conversation now.**",424,0.91

\*(According to Tradingview)

We already know that FB and Microsoft have benefitted from conferencing and everyone staying home during the lockdowns despite both (more the former than the later) having drops earlier this month.

So the earnings will be up (not that if they were negative it would change much) **so it's a very important thing to consider as the stock prices will likely go up.**

We already knew of the Qualcomm news with apple and factories in china starting to re-open production, will likely have a decent earnings which means the price will go up.

TSLA is arguably a scam stock depending on who you talk to, but puts rarely if ever, work on it, and it continues to climb. If there is a bubble to pop it won't be happening until it hits around or near $1000 per share.

***SPY was already up pre-market and continued climbing throughout the day today despite higher unemployment numbers, more business closures, and GDP contraction.***

All 5 will receive an ***additional benefit*** due to Dr.Jerome's **FED Promise Gurantee**, which will involve the fed continuing to pump money into the economy, help banks and larger corporations, and will be purchasing more junk bonds, along with other manipulation tactics.

This means that if you go in on all 5 of these with calls there is a 89% chance you will be ranking in massive dow either by the end of tomorrow trading day or until the end of Fridays trading day.

**Never before has such a tsunami of money been (Potentially) on the table for free.** The only wild card is how much TSLA will climb, but you could remove that risk and still have a safe money making bet regardless.

In short, Macrohard has just hit the 21 day SMA (a common indicator of short-term support). The RSI also has fallen to the 50's (an indicator that the  markets believe that the stock is no longer overbought). RSI has been over 70 up through this last week, so this should be a welcome indicator for those long MSFT. 

Typically, if MSFT were to continue to drop well below the 50 day SMA, then that would be cause for concern in the intermediate-term regarding the continued growth sustainability. Considering MSFT has been a stalwart for the Dow the last year or two, and that losses the last two weeks a have been in large part exaggerated by MSFT, its recovery should help the market rebound as well.",65,0.96
2021-03-02 22:28:57,Clov Fundamentally sound outlook. Why Clover Health is retarded.,"I've bought the falling knife. I enjoy high risk. Let me run you down some fundamentals on why this is an advanced long. Pun intended. (My screen name.)

Let's get to the meaty part first.

Lesson #1 Fraud is the most bullish word on Wall street, but even better is Monopoly, and Antitrust. Which is why retail weak fingers are getting walked down. (Regulation is the most feared btw.) If it wasnt for Clover health pulling some strings behind the scenes I dont think they would exist. Clov was caught running a red light, so take the fine, and get back in your Tesla. If not for fraud they wouldn't last a year. United health, and Blue cross would've destroyed them right outta the gate.  Look at the most fraudulent companies in the world. They're sporting the highest market caps. Ask Tesla bear scrubs Einhorn, and Gordon Johnson about how Tesla is a fraud. Apple, Msft, Amzn,  seen fraud litigations. Bring in Vivek, and Chamath. Accused of fraud. Get the point? Fraud is bank as long as your the fraud.

Who cares about Last year? You've heard this right?

""**Past performance** is **no guarantee** of future **results**""

A. Grew membership by 36.3%

B. Increased revenue by 45.6%

C. Gross profit increased to 12.2% of revenue

This means absolutely nothing. Again. **""Past performance is never an indicator of Future results.""**

**4 F's  - Future Fun Facts & fundamentals. Speculative Statistics.**

A.  The number of Americans ages 65 and older will more than double over the  next 40 years, reaching 80 million in 2040. The number of adults ages  85 and older, the group most often needing help with basic personal  care, will nearly quadruple between 2000 and 2040.  üëà  (Try search engine)

***Those statistics come true. Minimum +200% customers***

B. Government Medicare spending is set to increase from 15% to 19% üëà  (Try search engine)

***More revenues from the budget.***

C. Medicare for all. üëà  (Try search engine)

***""Medicare for all"" would push our potential customer base to the moon. (Full Population)***

D.. Clover health's competitors have over a trillion dollars in market cap to swipe.

***Always good to have healthy competition. UNH, ANTM, HUM, CI, plus private ones like Aetna***

E,F,G Highly Speculative. It's a healthcare insurer that's only medicare, and not yet in the workplace.

***If Clover health enters the entire health insurance market whole different valuation is coming.***

&#x200B;

TLDR; For those that are patient. This could be a really great long term growth investment. Clover health currently has less than 1% of available participants in healthcare marketplace.

Aside from the celebrity status of certain board members I'm going to tuck this one under the mattress, set a recurring investment, and probably have fun losing everything if tit's go up.

Hey guys, I just saw this post on twitter and I don't know if it's legit or not, but maybe we need to consider the impact of Coronavirus at the Redmond office potentially.

&#x200B;

We all know that $AMZN already has a confirmed case in their offices in Downtown Seattle. I hope people realize that this is the \*headquarters\* of Amazon and Microsoft we're talking about here, not some funky little field office.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/03/coronavirus-amazon-employee-in-seattle-office-tests-positive.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/03/coronavirus-amazon-employee-in-seattle-office-tests-positive.html)

&#x200B;

Given the existence of a case already at Amazon, I'm inclined to believe that the twitter post has a decent basis in being correct. What is the potential fallout for Microsoft if either

1. The office is shut down or heaven forbid.
2. There is an outbreak at the Microsoft headquarters.

2021-01-17 22:05:01,"Don't buy $BB calls, buy $BB shares - Here's why","I'll admit it. All this Blackberry pump got me hyped and I want to get some action too. BB has potential to moon, but I think a lot of you will still manage to lose money, because you are picking wrong strategies.

**The problem**

I know this sub is obsessed with short term OTM calls. However by buying these you are doing no justice to yourself and this community.

Let me explain. Have you ever wondered who sells you these calls? I'll tell you. Big guys and by big guys I'm talking billion dollar financial institutions that we call **market makers**. Market maker does not care which stock, what strike, how many üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ we put here - all they care about is to **make money by selling you calls.**

Market makers are very good at managing risk. Whenever they sell calls, they make sure they have the underlying stock. That way, they essentially sell **covered calls** instead of **naked calls**.

When you look at the option table, you will notice a column called **Open Interest**. It basically tells you have many option contracts are out there in the wild. Think about this as a number of retards holding these in their Robinhood account, hoping to get rich quickly.

Market makers love when there is a big hype around certain stock, especially certain strike and date. They sell these calls to you retards, and all they have to do as the expiration date nears is make sure **the stock stays below the most popular strike**, aka **strike with the most open interest**.

Why would they do that? Because they **make free money** by selling you these worthless gambling short term tickets.

How would they do this? By shorting the stock. Remember they are so big that they can afford to short the stock and suppress the price of the stock **in the short term** just in time for **your short term calls to expire worthless**.

I know some of you geniuses will tell me that market makers can't manipulate the stock in the short term; sure keep telling yourself that while you ride in your 2010 Toyota Corolla.

**You are easy targets**

Over 11,000 of you idiots, bought $12 February calls. Don't believe me? Check it yourself: [https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350903153433128967/photo/1](https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350903153433128967/photo/1)

All market makers have to do now, is make sure BB does not moon past $12 by February 19 and they are set. You lost your stimulus check money and have no means to play again.

March is even worse: [https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350910637451468801/photo/1](https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350910637451468801/photo/1). All of you piling into $15 strikes. Why are you making yourself easy targets? You are disclosing your strike and your date! What if BB moons in April? Can you sustain wasting money on these monthly calls with your minimum wage jobs?

**The solution**

Buy shares. They do not expire. There is no pressure to be right. You want to be on the üöÄ when it starts taking off, instead of being broke on the ground.

With worthless calls, no one will like you - even this sub will make funny of you.

Believe me. I've been here long enough to remember MSFT 03/21/2020 C $200 and PLTR 12/31/2020 C $30.

Buy BB shares, not short term OTM calls.",1588,0.96

2021-03-12 12:50:14,$LUMN - Lumen Technologies (Formerly CenturyLink) by u/uknj,"**$LUMN - Lumen Technologies (Formerly CenturyLink) by** u/uknj

Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink) is a telecommunications company which provides products and services related Network, Cloud, Security, Voice, and Managed Services to enterprise, SME, and retail customers. Lumen is aiming to position itself as a key infrastructure partner underpinning public and private cloud, edge computing and fiber connectivity. LUMN is building its services with 4 key areas in mind:

1. Physical assets and infrastructure ‚Äì These include fiber, hardware and facilities.
2. Software managed networking ‚Äì This is a network-as-a-service (NaaS) offering that can be leveraged to connect organisations with
3. Hybrid Cloud ‚Äì These include private cloud and datacentres, colocation services and connections with public cloud service provider partners.
4. Lumen Orchestrator ‚Äì This is the orchestration solution that allows for the management and control of the various services that are offered.

I am currently bearish about LUMN with no immediate plans to invest (although in the event of the price dropping into the single digits, I would re-evaluate this position). There are a few key reasons for this, but I encourage you to read the full bullish, bearish, and neutral considerations in the rest of the post:

1. LUMN earns a significant portion of its revenues from legacy offerings e.g., traditional telephony. This revenue stream has been decreasing YoY for the last few years and this is likely to continue.
2. Despite the above, there are significant areas of potential for LUMN ‚Äì specifically in their Edge Computing and software defined networking offerings (see Organisational Summary below). Edge Computing is only a small % of current revenues and while it is likely to grow, it will take time to significantly grow these streams. I view the Edge Computing growth as a slow burner and small market, but this will grow at a rapid rate in the future.
3. LUMN has a high level of debt, and while they have managed to de-lever and reduce interest rates, the amount of debt is still significant. When accounting for intangibles and goodwill, the level of liabilities is roughly 1.6x the value of assets (although specifically looking at long term debt this is a healthier picture at 70% of non-current assets).
4. Revenues have been consecutively down for the last few years and are unlikely to show a significant turnaround next year. This is somewhat mitigated by improvements in margin which are expected to continue and a healthy level of free cash flow at $2,770 although this has been declining YoY.

Please do have a read of the Bull, Bear and Neutral points in the detailed post below for a more balanced and in-depth view.

# Key Data

All data believed to be accurate as of 05/03/2021

* Price = $13.45
* P/E = -12x
* EPS = -2.12 (dil)
* Forward P/E = 8.5x

# Detailed Analysis

**Bull Considerations**

* $LUMN are well positioned to become significant players in high potential markets ‚Äì specifically fiber and underlying network infrastructure, NaaS and Edge computing.
* $LUMN has several verticals it can offer to customers including Hybrid Cloud, Connected Security and Collaboration. These can be leveraged to grow revenue streams in parallel (i.e., cross selling products and services to customers).
* Successfully managed to de-lever the company from previous debts. While this is a great deleveraging trend and a significant reduction in interest rates by redeeming outstanding 5.375% and 7.00% notes1 and replacing them with 4% bonds, the level of debt is still a concern (see bearish consideration item 1).
* The dividend from $LUMN has been consistent and relatively attractive (although on a yield basis this is less so if the price continues to rise). The board are committed to continuing the dividend payment and at the present time it can be safely assumed that $0.25 will be paid per share per quarter for the remainder of FY21. Dividend yield should not be the primary reason for going into $LUMN as yield is \~ 7% (at a stock price of $13.70). In the event of a dip to single digits, the dividend becomes extremely attractive and is worth considering (at a yield of > 9%).
* Despite the overall reduction in EBITDA (see bearish item 4), EBITDA margin has improved and is likely to continue improving into FY21 due to cost cutting measures being pushed by executive leadership.
* Significant number of insider purchases throughout 2020 with one sale.

**Bear Considerations**

* Overall, there are likely to be better candidates for returns on investments than LUMN, while LUMN is in a number of attractive areas, it is still growing revenues and these are unlikely to materialise in any significant manner over the next year or two. See competitive advantage section for additional details.
* $LUMN holds significant long-term debt of $31,837 (down from $34,694 in 2019). This debt is primarily due to $LUMN‚Äôs all in play to fiber (at the expense of 5g) when they purchased Level 3 Communications for $34,000. It is worth noting that $LUMN has not had an issue with either paying down debt and paying dividends with its current cash flow.
* $LUMN earns a substantial portion of revenues from legacy services. These include voice ($391 in 4Q20) which approximates to 29% of overall revenue. As can probably be guessed, this has regularly declined over the course of FY20. While not all the voice revenue is likely to be a ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù product, I am considering it as such as there are likely to be other legacy revenue streams. (N.B. According to $LUMN legacy revenues primarily include voice, private line (including special access), switched access and other ancillary services.)
* $LUMN is facing lengthening sales cycles for its products and services as their customers (and more likely organisations in general) continue to evaluate new infrastructure needs and delay purchasing unless necessary. This is likely to continue until at least 2022 as cost pressure at organisations globally push down purchases.
* Revenues are down both QoQ and YoY with EBITDA down YoY and there is no expectation that they will increase next year with best estimates at stable revenue / EBITDA and worst-case a reduction. YoY revenues have decreased for both FY20, FY19 and FY18, although the rate of decrease has reduced over time.
* Free cash flow while still high is reducing over time and will continue to do so as LUMN are likely to continue to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and paying off its long-term debt.
* Executive compensation (specifically focussing on CEO compensation) is above average for the industry at $17M (compared to an average of $10M for similar sizes). It is worth noting that when comparing against larger companies or those listed as competitors, this level of compensation was not unusual. Compensation did stabilise as performance dropped, however, no decrease in compensation occurred despite the decrease in earnings. While not initially a problem, if the results do not turn around, and there is no decrease in compensation, there is a concern that executive pay is no longer in line with the company‚Äôs results.

**Neutral Considerations**

* Long term credit rating (Moody‚Äôs) ‚Äì Ba3: Speculative with substantial - high credit risk.
* Speculative Grade Liquidity Ratings ‚Äì SGL-2: Good liquidity, will be able to meet their obligations over the next 12 months through mostly internal resources but may rely on external sources of committed financing.
* Southeastern Asset Management has increased its position in $LUMN as of Dec 2020. It is worth noting that they have lost (\~25%) on the investment to date2. Despite this, they remain bullish on the overall prospects as the CEO has tightened controls on costs and margin improves. Additionally, they believe $LUMN can monetise several segments they are in (specifically fiber), and that as a multiple of free cash flow (< 5 at the time of investing) is an attractive valuation. As a final point, they have signed an NDA with $LUMN, and this indicates a higher and more ‚Äúactivist‚Äù level of engagement3. I have listed this as neutral despite the bullish sentiment of SAM, as their track record for the last year has not been great compared to the overall market.
* $LUMN will be seeing reduced subsidy revenue (from CAF II ‚Äì A US initiative to improve connectivity) with subsidies declining to $20 by 2022. However, $LUMN believes their investment into providing this connectivity is likely to add to revenue that will make up for the loss in subsidy.

# Organisation Summary

Essentially Lumen Combine underlying infrastructure with platforms (i.e., cloud PaaS) and Applications (SaaS):

1. **Adaptive Networking** ‚Äì High performance network connectivity i.e., on premise private lines, Content Delivery Network, fiber internet connectivity, direct cloud connections (where they provide corporate WAN infrastructure a direct link to Cloud) and managed networking services / consulting.

* Content delivery network market growth is forecast to grow at 14% till 20254.
* Fiber Internet connectivity in the US grew at 12% from 2019-202022 and will likely continue to grow at a similar rate for the next few years. Across the EU growth rates are largely similar for both coverage growth and subscriber growth5.
* Software defined networking offerings (Networking as a service) is an expanding industry and likely to see significant growth of 34% annually till 20266.
* Growth rates and industry sizes for private lines and direct cloud connections are not easily available. I believe direct cloud connections are a growth area and likely to grow at a reasonable 10-15% annually for the next few years (based on over all cloud growth, increase in colocation and deployment of data centres ‚Äì see Hybrid Cloud below).

1. **Collaboration** \- VOIP, teleconferencing, collaboration solutions (e.g., file sharing and virtual meeting rooms all hosted by Lumen, but the products can be from vendors like Zoom, Webex Skype etc.), contact centres and calling services (e.g., traditional phone style calling both locally and internationally as well as toll free / business numbers. Also advanced emergency services support).

* VOIP is relatively mature industry with a CAGR of 12% (at best) till 20257. Personally, I think we can discount any mobile VOIP growth as I do not believe LUMN has offerings in this space and in my view, this would lower the effective CAGR with 8-10% looking a more reasonable target.
* Call centre growth is forecast to grow at 6% till 20278. The US houses over 60% of call centres globally, and this number is only going to decrease as increased internet penetration and decreased telecom rates drive the outsourcing of call centres9.
* Numbers and growth rates to traditional telephony are limited but I imagine that growth is probably negative. For toll free, business numbers and emergency services support, growth is likely positive but limited.
* Collaboration solutions are growing at a reasonably high rate of 13% till 202710. However, LUMN is limited to managing, implementing, running, and hosting products from other vendors as they do not sell their own.

1. **Connected Security** ‚Äì Threat management (managed threat intelligence), managed SOC services, WAF and DDoS mitigation, managed firewalls, and professional services.

* The WAF market is expected to grow at 18% annually till 202211.
* The DDoS mitigation market is set to grow at 15% annually till 202612.
* The managed security services are expected to grow at a CAGR of 8% till 202513. While I think managed firewall growth is likely to be less than other managed security services (e.g., IAM, SOC etc), a growth rate of 4-6% is probable.

1. Edge Computing ‚Äì Managed services, connections to both public cloud and private data centres, networking, colocation, cloud. Essentially connecting edge locations / end user servers to backbone infrastructure.

* Edge computing as an industry is forecast to grow at \~25% annually till 202514. However, it is currently a small market valued at \~ $ 2,000 in 20201. Edge computing as a market can be further subdivided into hardware, platform, and services. Hardware is expected to grow at the fastest rate of the three potentially reaching 40%15.

1. **Hybrid Cloud** ‚Äì Cloud storage, disaster recovery (data replication and business continuity), hosting services, data centres, private and public cloud alongside consulting for cloud.

* The private cloud market is expected to grow at 29% annually till 2025. Private cloud growth will primarily be driven by businesses who wish to take advantage of public cloud capability with the addition of potentially more secure and customisable hosting resources. On-premises cloud growth will be significantly lower than provider hosted options (PaaS / IaaS) which are likely to hit 50%16.
* Hosting services are likely to increase in market size by 15% annually17.
* Deployment of data centres are likely to increase slowly over the next few years with a growth rate not likely to exceed 10% (estimated at 6% for 202118). Similarly, colocation services are likely to see a modest 14% CAGR19.
* Global cloud storage is expected to increase at a rate of 20% till 202520.

# Competitive Advantage

1. **Adaptive Networking:**

* Summary: A large revenue earner with solid growth potential. $LUMN is a large player in the infrastructure space and should be able to leverage that to provide organisations with NaaS and global fiber connectivity.
* From a coverage perspective (compared to Verizon and AT&T as of 2019), $LUMN serves 16% of the population, with Verizon and AT&T serving 17% and 41% respectively. It is worth noting that $LUMN covers more states than either21, 22. N.B. this view is for consumers but presumably also can also be applied to corporate coverage.
* $LUMN is relatively well positioned from a fiber perspective as they have a lot of ‚Äúunique coverage‚Äù (i.e., locations served without significant competition) in the US and have coverage in Europe and Asia. They carry a large portion of internet traffic on their network backbone and have 180,000 locations globally which provide their customers direct access to $LUMN infrastructure. Additionally, they have direct connectivity to several cloud service providers and data centres. Compared to competitors, they appear to have the largest total fiber route23.
* The software defined networking offerings are an exciting growth opportunity and combined with the strong infrastructure position of $LUMN will mean that customers (particularly those that are multinationals and large enterprises) can utilise the network as a service offering to connect their enterprise infrastructure efficiently and effectively across the globe including connections from on-premises to cloud service providers.
* While competitors do exist, from both a software defined networking perspective (e.g., Fortinet, Cato etc.) and an infrastructure perspective (e.g. Verizon, AT&T etc.) $LUMN has the advantage of being a strong player in both areas with good partnerships with Cisco and VMWare.

1. **Collaboration:**

* Summary: Largely a legacy business and revenue generator for $LUMN. This will be a shrinking revenue area for $LUMN as the decline in traditional legacy telephony services is unlikely to be made up for by any growth in VoIP or collaboration solutions. Additionally, this area is a large revenue earner for $LUMN, and significant declines here would result in material impact to value.
* While implementing and managing VoIP, teleconferencing and collaboration solutions with partnered vendors (e.g., Zoom) are likely to show some little to moderate growth over the coming years, they will likely provide consistent revenue due to the underlying network requirements needed to effectively utilise such solutions.
* Traditional telephony services including contact / service centres and business telephony service revenues are likely to shrink over the coming few years.

1. **Connected Security:**

* Summary: The cybersecurity market is an exciting growth area which holds significant potential for $LUMN. However, it remains a small % of overall revenues and so revenue growth in-line with industry expectation will not materially impact the overall value of $LUMN.
* If $LUMN can leverage their verticals in the datacentre / cloud space to cross sell their security services this could see some reasonably large growth, but overall due to the small footprint of $LUMN in the cloud space presently, material value growth due to this vertical is likely be several years out.
* Additionally, $LUMN is not a recognised global player in this industry unlike Akamai or NetScout, and so will be at a disadvantage compared to incumbents with higher profile portfolios.

1. **Edge Computing:**

* Summary: This could be a strong growth area for $LUMN. Could be a way to take advantage of the potentially significant growth area of Edge computing. However, it is likely to significantly materialise only 1-2 years out with little revenue growth in this area prior to then as organisations slowly accept this paradigm shift. Additionally, it will be a highly competitive area that will require significant investment to grow and maintain an advantage.
* As of 23 Feb 2021, $LUMN claims they provide 60% of enterprise locations with <5ms latency to edge nodes. Their goal is 90% by the end of the year and their large fiber network leaves them at an advantage compared to competitors. (See Adaptive Networking).
* An example from the 4Q20 earnings call was SAP using their Edge infrastructure to bring SaaS applications closer to customers and bypassing unnecessary internet traversal.
* While $LUMN can leverage its underlying infrastructure and assets to push a solid offering, this is likely to be a highly competitive space with players including typical cloud service providers e.g. Microsoft, Amazon, Google and HPE as well as specialised players e.g. Mutable. Large cloud players will have both the hardware and software required to compete effectively with $LUMN while also being able to leverage their substantial public cloud technologies to gain an advantage.

1. **Hybrid Cloud:**

* Summary: If you are interested in taking advantage of private or public cloud growth then Lumen probably is not the best value even at its current multiple. This is due to low revenues (as a % of total revenues) from Cloud related activities. Additionally, this space is highly competitive and $LUMN does not appear to have the background or experience (it is working on growing its employee expertise) although they can potentially take advantage of their underlying infrastructure from their fiber and physical assets.
* Personally, I believe Private Cloud is not a significantly growing area with potentially some shorter term increase due to pandemic pushing a more remote working / access focus. However, longer term 3-5 years out, I think hybrid cloud will be the dominant focus as organisations transition from private cloud to increased public cloud usage. Only 3% of enterprises use private cloud exclusively24.
* If you are going to opt for growth within public cloud, there are higher growth options with AMZN, GOOG and MSFT although these are substantially higher in price. Alternatively, Cisco, HPE, or other smaller providers may work. A dedicated cloud provider will likely provide better value than $LUMN due to the low revenue share (see above).

Either   buy     to  open orders or sell to open orders and based on the   aggressiveness  of the orders one can infer its buy to open. Some of    these may be    hedges  and some most likely not.

Microsoft is the US government favored heir to the 5G software and infrastructure throne.

&#x200B;

**Xbox Series X and xCloud**

Here comes MSFT

>Xbox is working on a ""premium cloud-based game streaming experience"" with Samsung  
>  
>[https://www.gamesradar.com/xbox-is-working-on-a-premium-cloud-based-game-streaming-experience-with-samsung/](https://www.gamesradar.com/xbox-is-working-on-a-premium-cloud-based-game-streaming-experience-with-samsung/)

This experience will rely on 5G. The Xbox Series X may play a big role in this because of the following:

>Edge computing will be a key enabler for 5G to deliver on its bandwidth and latency requirements  
>  
>[https://www.thefastmode.com/expert-opinion/16410-5g-needs-edge-computing-to-deliver-on-its-promises](https://www.thefastmode.com/expert-opinion/16410-5g-needs-edge-computing-to-deliver-on-its-promises)

What if the weird shape of the Xbox Series X is due to built-in 5G antennas?

To back this speculation up, Microsoft says it‚Äôs planning ‚Äòbold‚Äô moves to make you pick the Xbox Series X over Sony‚Äôs PS5: [https://bgr.com/2020/02/11/xbox-series-x-vs-ps5-microsoft-has-bold-launch-plans-for-new-xbox/](https://bgr.com/2020/02/11/xbox-series-x-vs-ps5-microsoft-has-bold-launch-plans-for-new-xbox/)

Part of this bold move will assuredly be coupling the Xbox Series X with the xCloud, which is Microsofts cloud-based gaming service and it runs off of Microsoft‚Äôs Azure data centers. [https://www.geekwire.com/2019/testing-microsofts-project-xcloud-new-streaming-service-feels-like-magic-trick/](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/testing-microsofts-project-xcloud-new-streaming-service-feels-like-magic-trick/)

The Xbox will probably exist as the GPU edgenode for gaming but also a 5G node because the bigger picture above gaming applciations is delivering the software and infrastructure for 5G data distribution. This is Azures purpose.

&#x200B;

**Microsoft, Nokia, and 5G**

Remember the US nodding to Nokia and Ericsson for competing with Huawei for 5G [https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-02-12/forget-buying-nokia-the-u-s-has-a-60-billion-huawei-solution](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-02-12/forget-buying-nokia-the-u-s-has-a-60-billion-huawei-solution)

Well guess who's already partnered up with nokia and a little-known cullular provider for working on 5G?

>Microsoft is working with AT&T for future cloud and 5G applications  
>  
>[https://news.microsoft.com/2019/11/26/att-integrating-5g-with-microsoft-cloud-to-enable-next-generation-solutions-on-the-edge/](https://news.microsoft.com/2019/11/26/att-integrating-5g-with-microsoft-cloud-to-enable-next-generation-solutions-on-the-edge/)

Micrsoft also partnering with Nokia for cloud and 5G. [https://www.techradar.com/news/nokia-and-microsoft-sign-cloud-and-networking-partnership](https://www.techradar.com/news/nokia-and-microsoft-sign-cloud-and-networking-partnership)

And some supplementary Nokia & AT&T sauce

&#x200B;

**Azure and 5G**

Microsoft has been hard at work setting themselves up for this. Remember the JEDI contract?

>""We are the only guys today who have the ability to distribute computation, dispute data and then have consistency of management, security and data across those two plates,‚Äù Nadella added.  
>  
>[https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-explains-why-microsoft-won-the-10-billion-jedi-cloud-contract/](https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-explains-why-microsoft-won-the-10-billion-jedi-cloud-contract/)

Well what if JEDI is only the tip of the iceberg? Who cares about one $10B contract with the Department of Defense when 5G-serving wireless carriers are paying you for organizing 5G data distribution?

>Microsoft, Dell, and others are not developing 5G infrastructure hardware. Instead, they are developing a common engineering standard that would allow 5G software developers to run code atop machines that come from nearly any 5G hardware manufacturer. They are developing software and cloud capabilities that will replace a lot of the 5G equipment which is supplied by Huawei.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

BTFD

Take a look at what happened to Microsoft's share price after 10/26/2019. That was the JEDI contract boom. The share price trend following that date isn't going away any time soon. Every quarter they beat forecasted EPS. Azure is becoming the future of 5G software and infrastructure.",122,0.98

Gather round fellow autists, come one, come all. I've got quite the story to tell you all. Now, this isn't my story, but the story of a little company called Microvision (MVIS).

Most of us here don't know how to read so I will take that DD and make this as simple as possible. Here are some facts...**

&#x200B;

# FACT - Microvision is best in class (LiDAR, MEMS, etc.)

This is another FACT. Microvision's LiDAR is the **BEST IN CLASS. See the image below for a comparison between the competition. This ALONE MEANS THEY ARE MASSIVELY UNDERVALUED.**

&#x200B;

[Clearly, they are BEST IN CLASS](https://preview.redd.it/14zt6mmxgpd61.png?width=1446&format=png&auto=webp&s=c60f7170a195aafced5a0f60255a2dfc832e5b85)

From the chart above, clearly, they have the best LiDAR! **NOT ONLY ARE THE SPECS BETTER BUT THEIR A-SAMPLE IS GOING TO BE SHOWN OFF AROUND APRIL.** More than that, **THEY WILL BE READY FOR PRODUCTION GOING INTO THE FALL OF THIS YEAR!!** Which also makes them **FIRST TO MARKET** with a product like their LiDAR.

**TL:DR - MVIS IS BEST IN CLASS LIDAR** üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

&#x200B;

# FACT - Microvisions MEMS display hardware is used by Microsoft in the Hololens 2 and [IVAS](https://old.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/k9ge4v/defense_bill_clears_house_with_vetoproof_majority/) ([BAD.ASS.](https://old.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/k45io6/ivas_photo_80deg_horz_fov_waveguides_in_action/))

This isn't opinion, it is a simple fact. Those at Microvision and Microsoft will not actually acknowledge this fact, rumor is because they've been under an NDA for the last year or so. Every time either company is asked, they seem to deflect and name every other company like MVIS but not actually MVIS. WELL, [u/s2upid](https://www.reddit.com/u/s2upid/) over from [r/MVIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/) decided to take matters into his own hands. This many dropped $3,000 last spring just so he could DESTROY the device and find those pesky MVIS chips inside. [Looks like he found what he was looking for.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/gm1i2f/hololens_2_teardown_the_hunt_for_mvis/) This begs the question, why is this partnership so secretive? Well, the major rumor floating around right now is a **buyout from Microsoft.** Them being so secretive makes sense as MVIS has the best in class MEMS (and LiDAR), and it would make sense they don't want to get into a bidding war.

PS. Microsoft also has a US government contract to supply the military with modified Hololens 2s called IVIS which are purposely modified and geared toward military use and operations.

**US Gov contracts = $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$**

**TL:DR - POTENTIAL MSFT BUYOUT**üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

&#x200B;

# FACT - Microvisions isn't only LiDAR and MEMS

The fact here is that MVIS has **FIVE** potential verticals they can sell!

* Display only devices
* Interactive devices
* NED devices
* Consumer LiDAR
* Auto LiDAR

I'm not sure how many of you can even read this many words in a year. Who the hell knows the potential of these verticals. Or what hardware is in each one. Or the cross-vertical applications of the hardware. My brain is short-circuiting even trying to think of words to think about this thought.

**TL:DR -** üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

&#x200B;

# Okay, this is getting long so let me wrap up with the most important point...

# MVIS Competition

So far the two main competitors for Microvisions LiDAR are looking like **Luminar (LAZR)** and **Velodyne (VLDR). Let's look at some simple numbers.**

**Luminar (LAZR)**

* **Stock Price - $37.45**
* **Market Cap - 12.13B**
* **Float - 177.19M**
* **Shares outstanding - 218.82M**

**Velodyne (VLDR)**

* **Stock Price - $23.53**
* **Market Cap - 3.97B**
* **Float - 55.52M**
* **Shares Outstanding - 168.71M**

**Wow!** Look at those market caps! Now let's see how Microvision compares...

**Microvision (MVIS)**

* **Stock Price - $7.25**
* **Market Cap - 1.097B**
* **Float - 145.69M**
* **Shares outstanding - 151.31M**

# WAIT A SECOND! I THOUGHT YOU SAID MICROVISION WAS BEST IN CLASS?!!?!?!?!?!?!??! WHY DO THEY HAVE NO MARKET CAP?!?!?!?!?

Well fellow autists, this is where the undervaluation comes into play. **LAZR**, who just started talking about LiDAR and aren't anywhere close to where **MVIS** is, is valued at **12x the valuation of MVIS**. **Yet, MVIS has the best in class LiDAR, first to market, and FOUR OTHER VERTICALS BESIDES LiDAR. Same with VLDR, trading at 4x MVIS with only the LiDAR vertical.**

**This is where the play becomes really juicy.** Let's play with some valuation numbers. If Microvision is even **CLOSE** to delivering on their LiDAR promises, shouldn't they be valued at **AT LEAST VLDR?** Well, let's play and see how that works out...

**Let's work with $7 as each billion in valuation for MVIS,** VLDR is 4B which is 4x MVIS. **So $7 per billion \* 4 = $28 stock price**. Keep in mind, this isn't even them being best in class, this is just average for **ONE VERTICAL.**

**So let's work it with a LAZR valuation, which is 12x MVIS currently. So $7 per billion \* 12 = $84 stock price! AND THAT IS STILL ONLY ONE VERTICAL!**

&#x200B;

# Conclusion

I wonder how many of you even made it this far. Probably no one so just remember **MVIS actual valuation should be 4-12x what it currently is! So many tendies.** I'll link in a few more DDs if anyone is interested in reading a bit more in-depth. I highly recommend going to check out [r/MVIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/) as I would be nowhere without their genius. 100% best DD on Reddit outside WSB.
