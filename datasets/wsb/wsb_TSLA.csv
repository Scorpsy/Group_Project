2021-02-02 18:38:54,Message from a TSLA veteran: Shut the fuck up and hold,"Every other comment right now is a shill lamenting the stupidity of everyone who‚Äôs still holding or how sad it is the big guy won again or some other gloomy horseshit. 

To all of you who are out there who‚Äôve ever thought ‚Äúoh man, if I‚Äôd only bought X stock X years ago I‚Äôd be rich!‚Äù - if you aren‚Äôt holding right now, you‚Äôre wrong. 

I‚Äôm an actual investor, not a swing/day trader (I know, gay) and I went all in on TSLA back in 2019, so I had days where my account would lose 20% of its value. Weeks where it would lose half. I didn‚Äôt sell a share as it went from $960 to $330 pre-split. Nor the $460-$300 drop post-split. These are just a few examples. 

I bought GME because in a worst case scenario some crazy illegal shit happens and I now have a long term position in a solid company. I covered my cost basis in tranches on the way up and now I‚Äôm holding the remaining 300 shares with house money. If it‚Äôs too late for you to do that, take it as a lesson for next time.  What was Melvin‚Äôs mistake? No actual hedging. Don‚Äôt be a Melvin. . 

A good investment requires holding 9/10 times. The overnight million dollar plays are very rare, because they take a higher ratio of luck than confidence. This shit is a lot like dating - your confidence won‚Äôt help if you‚Äôre making shitty picks, but your good picks will never pan out without confidence. $GME has my confidence- the numbers are in our favor. And so, I hold. And I sleep like a baby at night. I have 300 shares, and I‚Äôve lost a nauseating amount of money the past two days. 

But I don‚Äôt give a fuck. 

Hold, relax, forget about it. We own the stock, we aren‚Äôt the ones bleeding interest. As much as the hedges have their cheating, we have nuclear bombs too- one whale, one great piece of news, one exercising of stock options by a certain Ryan Cohen... I could go on. 

It‚Äôs not a sure thing, but anyone acting like we‚Äôre in dire straits probably didn‚Äôt comprehend what was going on in the first place. Just shut the fuck up and hold. Do you want to be the ‚ÄúGolly I could‚Äôve had Apple 20 years ago!‚Äù guy for the rest of your life, or do you wanna be the strong motherfucker who actually took the leap?",60235,0.87

2021-01-26 16:47:41,Curious why Papa Elon is shilling $GME? It‚Äôs because Melvin Capital shorted $TSLA for years and bragged about it.,"Elon has battled shorts for almost a decade. We all remember when he complained that shorting should be illegal, and when he released ‚Äúshort shorts‚Äù when he finally defeated them. 

But guess who used to brag about shorting Tesla? Gabe üåàüêª Plotkin. 

From [Bloomberg:](https://www.bloomberg.com./news/articles/2019-07-19/cohen-cub-gabriel-plotkin-sees-fund-surge-about-44-this-year)

Plotkin described Melvin as ‚Äúa very human-intensive place. We have a lot of analysts, we require a lot out of them.‚Äù The team has modeled more than 500 companies in ‚Äúsignificant detail,‚Äù while a data science group reads into trends.
He added that the firm has an ‚Äúintense focus‚Äù on the short side, with about 70% of profits in Melvin‚Äôs first year coming from bearish bets. Plotkin expressed skepticism about mall real estate investment trusts, as well as electric-car maker Tesla Inc.

$GME to the üåö, then profits back to a safe store of value: $TSLA.

UPDATE 1: 
FAQs since y‚Äôall ask the same god damn questions 
- Why exercise instead of sell the contracts and just buy the shares? Because they were so in the money I would have had to pay massive short term capital gains taxes. 
- when did you buy the contracts? 9-12 months ago. 
- do you still believe in TSLA? Yes, it‚Äôs my biggest holding. It‚Äôs the most innovative company of our lifetime and will probably be the world‚Äôs most valuable company before the end of the decade. 
- will you teach me options? No, read/watch everything you can to learn. 
- what options are you buying right now? Basically none, all you degenerates have driven up the premiums and there are few good deals. I buy shares and I sell options on occasion. Only ~5% of my portfolio is options. 
- what stock should I buy right now with my $38? I don‚Äôt give financial advice. Read my post history to see what I‚Äôm buying and decide if you like any of the ideas.

2021-03-06 03:02:58,The TSLA bubble has finally popped,"Good morning fellow Daddy Musk fans, it's time we talk about what's  happening with TSLA and why it's happening.

As many of you are by now  aware TSLA has been in free fall for the past month blasting through  multiple ""support levels"" and leaving a **trail of loss porn** behind. Now you may be wondering why your OTM weekly calls are  going to zero week after week and I'm here to tell you it's not going to  get better.

Let's take a journey aboard the modern day EV Titanic known as TSLA.

**Disclaimer: This is fan fiction I write at night after I drop off my wife at her boyfriends place, not financial advice.**

Before you blast my ass how TSLA shorts have been fucked every single time during the past years I'll explain to you why **this time it's different**. I'll start with a late 2019 quote from our autistic uncle Dr. Michael Burry.

*""Passive investing has removed price discovery from the equity markets.""*

What  does this mean? Well, the quote applies to the overall market but in  the case of TSLA it means actively managed mutual funds with TSLA long  positions have been replaced by passive index funds and ETFs. Passive  funds have overtaken active mutual funds market share in the past 2  years. How the fuck does this relate to price discovery? It means for  the past 2 years retards and degenerates like us have been piling money  onto ETFs like Mommy Cathie's ARKK without actually doing any DD on what  turds the ETF is actually holding. I know, the gains have been  impressive with CNBC and Bloomberg praising Cathie's ETFs to the fucking  moon. Fair enough, however let's take our lips off **Cathie's tits** for a second and look at what ARKK is actually holding.

Here's the punch line (taken from a random tweet yesterday):

**Top  10 ARKK companies have a combined market cap of $1200B with revenues of $76B and  earnings of $2.5B. If it was a single company it would be trading at  480x earnings, 16x sales with a profit margin of 3,3%.**

Let that shit sink in before we move on.

Now back to the situation at hand. ARKK is down 25% in the past month and so are the other **simp funds** trying to ride **Mommy Cathie's ass**  to the moon. Outflows from the ETF have accelerated in the recent  month, which will cause Cathie to sell off her overvalued babies and dump  them onto the street with TSLA being the biggest and most overvalued  stock she's holding with a weight of 9,99% of ARKK. The outflows may  cause overall liquidity issues for her fund, [/u/seldomsage](https://www.reddit.com/u/seldomsage/) wrote a great post about this shit on [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) . Go read that shit to understand what's about to happen.

Let's leave the **certified GILF** alone and jump into a hot tub time machine back to December 2020. Our **gay uncle Burry**  came out of the closet early December last year and stated he's  shorting TSLA. Why? Well he recognized active players on TSLA had gotten  out and short interest was extremely low (limiting any short squeeze  risks, I believe it was around 5% of float). I believe after reading the  üåàüêª erotica uncle Burry has been tweeting for the past months, the **cocaine nosed HF suits**  on Wall Street started to pile onto his TSLA short. You can clearly see  this in TSLA options chain, the put/call ratio and spiking short  volume. It seems right now everyone and their retarded cousin is  shorting TSLA. This will lead to a cycle where TSLA goes down, ETFs  holding TSLA will go down, outflows from ETFs will continue and TSLA  will go down even more. Thus, there's a chance TSLA will drag down the  overall market with it.

In addition here's a list of smooth brained arguments why I think TSLA is still going down.

1. The **P/E is still 938**. No fund manager with an IQ above 80 will touch this stock at these prices.
2. The stock is at **$597 a piece**. Most of us work at Wendy's and don't have the cash to buy a single share.
3. Call options are **expensive as fuck**, again, Wendy's.
4. TSLA stopped taking orders for entry level Model Y. Together Model 3 and Model Y account for **90% of TSLA sales**.
5. **Lithium shortage**, probably related to point 4.
6. Ford and Volkswagen. Particularly **Ford Mustang Mach-E**, which started eating away TSLA market share.
7. The  jig is up. Selling flamethrowers and tweeting memes wont make TSLA  profitable any time soon, eventually the market will go back to the  fundamentals and realize that TSLA is actually just a car company with **low profit margins**.

Lastly I'm not saying TSLA is a bad company or that the products are bad. In fact I think they're making **great products**, the company is just **BIGLY** overvalued at this point.

Good Afternoon,

The music to this post is **Dream Rider** by **Wice.**  Put it on.

I have no idea what I am saying, this post is not financial advice.  I am probably hallucinating.  **Med Status = Not taken**.  You shouldn't ever by any means listen to anything I have to say or take this at all as recommendation to invest.  I am currently a brain in a jar being deceived by a Cartesian demon. I am not even real...

Edit 12 - If you want to skip to the **money shot** [find the psycho-tier options ladder discussion here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzd9js/goev_the_bull_case_of_canoo_inc_aka_goev_aka/gq5rnbz?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)

Edit 15 - We were wrong on the math... The money shot is good but its not go to prom in a helicopter good... Its show up in your dads WRX with in a mexican suit, hair slicked back sunglasses indoors good...  Either way you're still going to get laid....

Edit 4 - You read something I write that's wrong, Call me out.

I own a share and 25 15$ 4/16 calls

**$GOEV needs no introduction.**  It is a pig of a stock that has burned many... many hands... Had I the will or desire to put this thing I would be a rich man... however I was a wide eyed, impressionable STONK Noob .. always looking for that dose of Hopium. I looked up its website, when I saw its futuristic products I thought of the Star before the TREK, I thought of 3d Jetsons, A brave new world... I bought hard into the Apple car myth and gladly with a smug expression YOLO'd away a few K of hard earned money into some 30 dollar calls that sat hopeless on my account bringing nothing but misery and sadness... I bought these calls at a few dollars!!!!  An albatross of shame... Even the GOEV reddit is full of embarrassing cope posting offering nothing and taking every last shred of dignity.....**(Edit 7 : the Canoo one is much better)** Being long in GOEV is like being a eunuched Tesla bro... All whisky no dick..  All hat no cattle...

**But no longer!** **my friends no longer...**

You will come to understand that I am **UNCONCERNED** about the current SP.

It is only a meal ticket to golden palaces and walkways paved with diamonds... no ice.

# The quick Stats -

**Origin Story -** GOEV SPACed into existence DEC 2020 on Nasdaq.  Ulrich Kranz -  The CEO built the BMW Z3, x5 and the Mini and led BMW's ""project I"" and is balls deep in the automotive world.  They are advising Hyundai on their EV vehicles and creating their own with a subscriber model.  Their main addition to this crowded space is the ""Skateboard"" style drive train that you can build on top of... Fly by wire functionality allows designing all sorts of awesome things.... Oh and the ""You will own nothing and be happy about it"" car subscription which is like leasing but probably even worse...

**The Myth** \- **Apple car**... Probably not happening... But they talked to CANOO!@#@! Canoo and Hyundai/Kia are in bed together... they gotta be part of it. I Saw nothing but money $$ bills and convinced some of my friends that absolutely there would be an apple car ad for the superbowl. I didn't even care about the game... I couldn't wait.... When that failed to drop I told myself... ""They were totally acting like an apple partner, not tweeting, its smart... be silent, they are going to drop news any day now... Apple Rumors bro...  I got addicted to copium.... Every day was just another opportunity to buy the dip...

I woke up.. strung out... Eyes bleary red, shirt untucked, tie askew I hadn't shaved for weeks... Shambling around at work muttering ""Apple partner, they're silent... Its a good thing....  Cheaper now... Its on sale... Hold forever.... New tesla... You can't tell me I'm drunk, thats my decision...""

I got burned on this one kiddos.... Turned me to the dark side... I learned about Puts...

I felt my power RISING.... I got into Ortex... I troll on Stocktwits.. I enjoy the suffering... I owned the world, the streets were full of blood and I was their king...

So while many of you were crying I went shopping in the trashcan last Friday and took a sarcastic look at $GOEV again...

**What I found was beautiful.**

I felt something stir... was it hope?  Was there something here?  Can I believe again?  Is there anything good left in this world?

You tell me...

# Some Important numbers

# Float: 235.6 Million

**Free Float - 53 percent (120 million)**

**Short Shares on Loan 6.94 Million**

# Short Utilization - 99.7 percent let me say that again 99.7 percent of the shares available to loan are loaned!

# Ortex predicts short interest 8.4 Million Shares!

# More than 100% utilization! Naked Shorting!

^(Edit 13 - \^\^Probably legal)

*Edit 2: I originally said 100% Short Interest but meant* ***utilization*** *thanks* /u/SheriffVA *for pointing out the typo...*

**DTC is 1.4!!!**

By my  estimates (Ortex numbers) shorts are short from 17 to 20 as we see a spike in short activity at those prices... the SP of 11 is currently well below the 20day moving average...  SP of 18 will create a squeeze...

# The play

March 11th at 1:40 Pm there will be a press announcement by Canoo who is attending the prestigious Motor Press Guild's Virtual Event.   Canoo promised a manufacturing partnership announcement Q1... Who else is there... let me see **Jeep Honda Acura Toyota VW Infinity**... and **Fisker** which develops EV's but higher end luxo models... Canoo and Fisker don't need to compete...

**But brotherluminous EV cars are a bubble?**

You're a bubble... Should they announce a top tier manufacturing agreement that revalues the company all the money in the other parts of the bubble will flood in and then it will be gucci bubble palace and fat stacks of Tendie gains...  what better time to do it than during a press event at an industry magazine...

Edit - 13  Canoo is world premiering their pick up truck... I don't know which way this will go...

I predict an old fashioned Short squeeze as Shorts will be trapped at **17 - 20** and **the SP will be on mars somewhere looking for the keys to its electric Lambo...**

# Do you want an electric lambo?  I do...

# I'll see you at the dealership...

No more cope posting $GOEV bros.. Only tendies now...

Edit 1- [https://u.teknik.io/Wy7Mm.png](https://u.teknik.io/Wy7Mm.png) Ortex Screenshot

Edit 3 -  So perhaps some expectation management.  With an estimated 8million shares being sold short there will be a noticeable impact to the SP of a squeeze... Will we see GME?, **probably not**, It will be more like $RKT with portfolios being liquidated into the AH robo-buying the ask.. If we are lucky enough to get a 25-30 sp. **I fucked up and held some $RKT calls overnight the day of the fappening, don't be like me...**  There will be a certain number they will defend and open up more short positions from.  **It all depends on the DV presented by the company Thursday.**  Should there be a reason to revalue the company then we win... Should it just be a showcase and nothing Materially different offered then... well that sucks for everyone involved... In fact.. much like earnings calls most people buy the hype and sell the news... there will be no expectation that this will be different than that...

But look, If they bust on the stage with The Canoo-UBEREATS-Amazon Party VAN drone Apple Car complete with integrated Pornhub socket... And you diamond handed that shit.... Giddyup

2021-02-12 23:00:16,$TSLA is positioned for a massive reversal,"Tesla's current market cap is the result of multiple positive feedback loops which has pushed its price to a ludicrous level via Short + Gamma Squeezes (it is also important to note virtually all TSLA shorts are out^(1)). This campaign has been largely led by large hedge funds. Without S&P inclusion, the story might have ended there with hedge funds trying to escape with their profits and leaving retail the bag. However, S&P inclusion presented these hedge funds with a much better option to close out their positions while also riding the stock down. The shares that hedge funds no longer wanted began to be picked up by passive funds leading to selloffs by the active funds which pushed prices to this level.

&#x200B;

With passive funds holding the bag, the hedge funds which lead the rally seem to be attempting to push the price back down through a reverse gamma squeeze^(2).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l9c5bcwnz6h61.png?width=871&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea1381af1f64f4e29a5bfcd4082f5df4e394283

No retail trader is buying 1m+ in deep OTM puts, this is an attempt by hedgies to push the price down.

We can also see this from the massive shift in options volume. $190B of calls open interest and over $250B of puts open interest, a massive put skew. This is especially significant because ""To put it in context it is equal to the combined $AAPL and $AMZN bullish skew or if you‚Äôd rather to the combined  $BABA, $FB, $MSFT, $GOOG and $WMT combined."" reflecting extremely bearish sentiment in an very very bullish market.

Once the reversal begins there will be nothing stopping it as OTM puts get less and less OTM. There are no shorts left to be squeezed and the bag holding passive funds which are largely barred from holding derivatives will have no way of rebalancing the options skew.

2021-03-05 08:52:34,What's happening to TSLA right now?! Down 36% this month. Most shorted stock?,"In the last month, TSLA has dropped 36%. I'm curious as to why it may have been so affected. The stock dip seems a little extreme compared to any of the potentially negative public news rumors that I've read:  


* There was a two-week production line shut down due to battery supply issues that have been restarted.
* Price cut to Japan car imports.
* Discussion of federal interest rate hikes that could affect growth stocks that were later alleviated to some degree.
* Tesla did not announce a hard number for expected deliveries for 2021. Instead, they said that they expect more than 50% growth this year due to a doubling of their gigafactories.
* Tesla bought $1.5 billion of digit currency which opens them up to additional risk
* Ford Mustang EV has launched, though the number of units sold has been quite minimal  


I read in a number of articles that TSLA is the number one shorted stock. I wonder how much that may be affecting the current stock price. With their new factories, the price of their digital currency, new CyberTruck, new tradeable, automotive regulatory tax credits, and the new EV tax credits being discussed. I was leaning towards 2021 being another big year for TSLA.  


By and large, there has been a lack of Tesla-related news this quarter for this amount of movement. I wasn't expecting Q1 to be great but this seems crazy.",119,0.83

2021-02-28 09:47:40,Is the TESLA #TSLA Hype over or we are heading to new Highs soon?,"Last week was a good week for all the Tesla sceptics who are waiting for the so-called ""Hype"" to be over and the price to drop. But are they right? Let's look at some of the macro and micro trends and let's see where the share price could be possibly heading.

**1. Macro:**

* In the US, Biden has made it clear that the EV boom is just getting started. This means, that those who are already ahead of the curve are in a very strong position.
* He made it clear that we are going to see a major shift, stating he plans to replace the entire government vehicle fleet with electric vehicles.
* That includes 245,000 in various federal agencies‚Ä¶ 225,000 in the United States Postal Service‚Ä¶ and another 173,000 in the military.
* That adds up to a grand total of 643,000 cars, trucks, and vans set for an upgrade on the U.S. government‚Äôs dime.¬†
* Also across the world, more countries are following or have already started.
* For example, Norway imposed several changes in the government years ago just like the United States, and it‚Äôs led to a sweeping transformation.¬†
* In fact, 54% of all vehicles sold in the country last year were electric vehicles.

**2. Micro:**

* Tesla's forecast in terms of deliveries is looking very promising.
* Deliveries are expected to rise from about 500,000 last year to 894,000 this year and 5 million by 2024. By 2030, annual deliveries could climb to about 9 million.
* This is mainly due to increased efficiencies in the production and new productions plants being built in China, Germany and Texas
* Some analysts also expect that Tesla could be generating 37bn free cash flow by 2025; just as a comparison Facebook is currently generation 23bn.

To summarise: Before any sceptics get too happy, Tesla is still a very much hold for us and some well-known analysts even anticipate the **price to head towards $1200 next year**.

Why is this important? Tesla continues to dominate every sector of the EV market. If VW can‚Äôt sell the ID3, then who the fuck has a prayer of competing? 

Every car Tesla sells is another candidate for Fsd take (100% profit margin), premium connectivity, Tesla insurance, and future entertainment options. FSD and insurance are going to be paired‚Äî use of the former will reduce the cost of the latter, providing a massive incentive to go all in

2021-02-24 13:00:34,A üåàüêª perspective on $TSLA,"Long time lurker, first time poster, super üåàüêª on $TSLA. 

EDIT: I forgot you guys can't read - TL;DR: short term üöÄüöÄ, long term = big ‚¨áÔ∏è. A good way to look at it is - to increase in value Tesla has to do everything right for years and still get lucky. For the stock to go down they only have to fuck up once, or maybe not even at all. 

Before I start let me make it clear that, I eat crayons for breakfast lunch and dinner and I am by no means an expert - this is hardly a *serious* DD like some others I've seen here before. This is just my opinion and my take, do what you will you beautiful retards

Also - I like Tesla, and I respect them a lot. I love that they made electric cars S3XY, and I want one, but God damn if they aren't insanely overvalued. I'm betting against the stock, not the company. Let's just start off with some easy facts you paste eaters can understand - Tesla right now is more valuable than basically every major car manufacturer (+Lyft) COMBINED. I love their cars, but dude holy FUCK. You absolute apes drove this stock into the stratosphere and beyond. So let's talk why this action today is expected, natural, and IMO, only sealing Tesla's fate towards reality.

First - Tesla was practically insolvent not that long ago. Elon even admitted as much [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/03/musk-tesla-was-about-a-month-from-bankruptcy-during-model-3-ramp.html). While they have done extremely well since then, and have insane amounts of cash coming on hand (especially Q42020 where they skyrocketed in cash on hand up to 16 BILLION USD from $3B), this worries me more than encourages me. Why aren't they spending this cash on future R&D efforts, paying down debt, making even more factories (yes yes India I know, but MORE), charging stations, battery tech, or even give a bonus to all of their overworked laborers and employees that worked almost 60 hour weeks non-stop despite Coronavirus and rampant wildfires last summer to hit (barely) their delivery targets, etc? Tesla already has mega churn because Elon/'the culture' burns people out, and a bonus would be super well received I'm sure. Nope, they buy some digital currency (you know the one). Look, say what you will, Elon is a bit of a weirdo. Love him, but man if he isn't unusual for a Billionaire visionary, and that move was definitely weird for a large(ish) corporation to do with so much money given they're so young, relatively unproven (compared to other auto makers, at least in the eyes of the boomer clan) and looking to aggressively ramp up production. To me, it shows they don't have significant ideas for rapid future growth that they can realistically hit with that cash, so they'd rather drive traffic to sales via, well, a meme. That might be a genius move, but it's definitely non-standard and doesn't speak to confidence in new development coming easily. This means, at least to me, with Tesla, what you see is what you get. They don't have any huge surprises coming, or new products lurking that we haven't already heard about (robotaxi lol, $25k car, etc). They don't have a huge pipeline of new tech ready to roll out, and they aren't aggressively rolling funding into even further development to not only stay ahead of the giants that are creeping up but to run past them and push farther ahead. Ford, BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Porsche, etc all have EVs on market this year, and all have significantly more infrastructure and capital on hand to shift to meet the growing EV demand. They're behind, but not for long. They may be slow giants, but they didn't get there for free, and they have been there that long for a reason. Finally, EV is the future for now, but what if in five years it's hydrogen, or fucking fusion, or maybe even some bad stuff happens with EV and everyone wants ICE again - Tesla is super exposed to one industry while the giants have their feet in both pools at once - might make them slower, but it's also less risk, and they're not THAT slow seeing as they're already on the market. It is legitimately retarded to count those auto-makers out. At that point just roll your 401k into Robinhood.

Second - let's talk Tesla fundamentals (ish). I'm not gonna dig into the numbers and financials because I am a moron and I don't know how. What I am gonna talk about is the business compared to their peers. Here is what Tesla (currently) sells and bulls say they are going to be insanely profitable from: Cars (duh), Solar roof/Solar wall, Robotaxis eventually, Insurance eventually, Semis eventually. People like to lump batteries in here as some sort of profit saving thing but it really might not be (maybe, maybe not, time will tell), and I'll talk about that in a second. 
Cars, duh, Teslas are dope as hell. They have had their issues in the past, but they're sick and people want them. Demand is there for sure and growing rapidly, I won't deny. BUT, others are catching up just as fast as the market is shifting towards EV. Meaning, when the old, crusty ass MFs who don't know ""What's an electricity"" decide they want an EV, they will have SIGNIFICANTLY more choice as consumers than you or I today if we were to go car shopping. This will, undoubtedly, pull away from Tesla sales. You can assume that Tesla somehow magically doesn't lose any interest in a field with increasing competition, but this just isn't reality. People like new things, and companies that make new good cars will see sales. Tesla is that right now, will they be that in the future? I'm not certain. See production scaling concerns above. To really assume they won't lose any consumer interest despite growing competition, they'd need to be pumping out multiple different models. I'm talking a non ""cyber"" Tesla truck, some sort of hatchback/sport crossover, maybe even an 'adventure sport' rig like an EV 4 Runner or the EV Hummer that's coming out. Americans like big cars, it's a fact. Just because it's an EV and saving the planet doesn't mean consumers want to sacrifice - this is why Tesla was and has been successful, because they finally made an EV that wasn't fugly as shit and a laughing stock, but if they don't continue to drive innovation into existing ICE sectors with EV tech, they're going to get left behind. Tesla is gonna want to capture this market share, and they haven't even hinted at it so far. I don't know specific numbers, and I don't think anyone legitimately does so take everything you read with a grain of salt, but Tesla isn't going to be leaps and bounds ahead of competitors in the future EV sphere unless they really buck up. If anything, by not doing these things now, they're backing themselves into a corner and a specific 'look' that might be hard to shake later.
Next: solar things. Solar wall and roof are dope, but they're not cheap, and pretty niche right now. It requires living in an area with enough sunlight and being able to afford them in the first place. There's also just not a ton of consumer demand for this right now. We *could* see a huge consumer shift towards personal responsibility for green energy, in which case this stuff may become ultra profitable, but it's still a matter of scale. I don't know their production numbers but with how little I've heard about it, I don't think they're huge, and if demand spikes, they won't be in a great place to capture it if they aren't scaling appropriately (see cash concerns above). 
Now let's talk Robotaxis and Insurance. Insurance is a dud, that's not big money. Maybe I'm not just a retard, but also an idiot, but I truly don't think Tesla offering insurance does ANYTHING positive for their bottom line. The way I understand the proposition is that because they're so confident in their self-driving tech they would become your insurance company, insuring you if FSD made any mistakes. This is a lot of liability forrrr nothing. They can't really take payments for it, unless it's well below what consumers pay now for insurance, otherwise are they really so confident about their tech? If that's the case, insurers will drop rates and lay off employees/close locations to meet those rates because a) they like money and b) it's even easier money than now if they're less likely to pay out. At a certain point, Tesla's ""insurance"" is more just a warranty than anything seriously profitable for Tesla. They take on a lot of risk, and can only really do this once a certain number of autonomous vehicles are on the road to ensure their liability isn't too high (AND after regulatory bodies have been coerced into approving this), otherwise they're taking on a lot of risk for basically no gain. Robotaxis are equally dud-ish. Again, maybe I'm just a fucking mouth breathing smooth brained ape but people like people. Even though people bitch about other people, everyone bitched about being inside/away from society during Rona and never seeing anyone. Some people like those random interactions you get with a real person, and some people just truly don't trust robots. Both of these take away from potential customers/market share Tesla is likely to see from Robotaxis. Also old people and tech don't generally mix. Getting better, but still, old people and robots likely won't be a hot seller. Further, regulation and the required insurance/warranty/coverage whatever for this whole operation won't be quick or cheap. What happens when someone has a heart attack or passes out (asleep or faints) in your Robotaxi? What happens if it does happen to get in an accident, or if it gets a flat tire? What happens if the address is wrong, or someone needs to change where they're going? What if they have a thick accent and the vehicle doesn't respond, or what if they aren't a native speaker or are disabled (mute, deaf, blind, need assistance getting into trunk or into/out of car)? How do these situations get handled? Finally - not everyone wants to have random people in their car, especially without supervision. What if someone trashes your car? Or pisses/shits/pukes in there while they're drunk? Sure Tesla or whoever might cover you, but Robotaxis won't clean themselves. Further - what about charging? The cars won't charge themselves after they're done with their 'shift', so unless you're able to go out and plug it in, what happens if charge is too low for you to then drive home? Guess you gotta wait. Not saying it's impossible, just that there are a lot more factors that need to be addressed before this is a slam dunk. And here's the kicker - it's not even a super profitable industry. Uber is operating at a loss and they're the defacto millennial ride calling service. Lyft and Yellow Cab still exist, among a host of other ride sharing services especially abroad in places like Asia. Europe is much more walkable IMO so it's not *as* popular from what I've seen, but in major cities (London) sure it still is. Overall Robotaxis aren't really gonna be the future unless a fuckload of good shit happens for Tesla and basically every boomer suddenly loves robots. Plus, if everyone has a Tesla, who the fuck is riding in the Robotaxis? Even if you assume somehow Tesla starts being like USPS or Amazon and delivering packages/groceries/becomes a god damn short bus, there still will be competitors and it's still not as easy as saying 'but it's the fUtuRe'.
Semis - I don't know shit about shit here, but I haven't heard much more than a peep about this, so I'm naively assuming it's not a huge corner of Tesla's business projections for the future. Maybe Tesla becomes the Daimler of EV and sells only big ass EV Semis, but I doubt it. I don't see this being a huge money maker, perhaps I'm very wrong.
Lastly batteries - lots of people like to say how Tesla's batteries are gonna make them tons of money and much better than their competitors, blah blah, but I don't really buy this. Their tech may be really good now, but other companies with a lot more money and history of development are coming HARD for the money in the EV sphere. I don't want to assume that these companies will necessarily make their own battery tech - but SOMEONE will. People like money, a lot. If these companies don't figure out how to build their own batteries like Tesla, someone will. And here is where Tesla's battery strategy becomes not super useful - Tesla paid a fuck load upfront in capital expenditure to finance and develop factories to make these batteries - if another company starts making batteries that are even remotely comparable to Tesla's, they will likely end up a lot cheaper (eventually, not immediately) because they will begin producing en masse to support allllll the other EV makers, (standardizing in the process no less) not just the batteries Tesla needs. And if that never happens, it means the EV makers made their own, which means they are confident enough in their own cost/performance/etc, and Tesla really isn't that far ahead. I know Tesla has a big advantage here now, but that doesn't mean people who worked on Tesla batteries won't go work elsewhere for more money, and it doesn't mean these other companies won't hire young and hungry Masters and PhD grads to develop cutting edge battery tech straight off of their full ride to Yale. In fact, that tech is probably already being developed in Ivy League labs for fun by those exact types of people for their PhD and Professors using their grant and research money, hell some boy scout in a garage in Iowa might be doing it right now. Tesla may be a leader now, counting on them to stay dominant and leaps and bounds ahead forever is not just foolish but stupid. Everyone buying in and hoping for this stock to go to $1500+ is either completely braindead, irretrievably stupid, or not paying any attention whatsoever. They're assuming Tesla is operating in its own little quarantine zone where nobody ever competes with them and they're the golden child forever. Look, I like Tesla, but no matter what endeavor they go after, someone else is gonna go for it too. Tesla may end up being better at it, but that doesn't make them insanely profitable off the rip and it doesn't mean everyone will use Tesla's stuff. Some people don't like the brand, some people don't like Elon, others may just like other stuff more. 

Finally, look at the ""anatomy of a bubble"" and compare it to Tesla's stock chart. It's shockingly similar. I know, I know, that's moronic, but I'm a moron and a üåàüêª so what can I say. The other eerily similar chart and comparable situation is Radio Corporation of America circa 1930. Radio was hot new shit and everyone thought it was the FUCKIN FUTURE dude. So shares skyrocketed and everyone hopped in but oopsie, turns out radio wasn't the paradigm shifting thing everyone thought it would be, and stock prices tanked. This has happened with every bubble, ever. Everyone thinks they're invincible, everyone thinks this time is different, everyone thinks the institutions know their shit and are never wrong, ever (Cathie Wood √§hem √§hem), but every. single. time. they've been proven wrong. Fundamentals always matter, and Tesla ain't there chief. Finally - Graham, Dodd, Buffet, some of the most legendary investors/investing advice people EVER whose advice has withstood many many decades and market conditions, warn about 'buying at any price, assuming the stock will continue to increase so no matter where you buy in you'll make money'. This sound familiar? How about those ludicrous price targets of $1600/share? Sound reasonable? Unless Tesla fundamentally shifts the way we as a society think about and approach transportation as a whole (and I don't just mean ICE to EV retards), their valuation is completely temporary and entirely fucked.

There's a few catalysts that I can think of as well - some bearish, some bullish. 
For some bullish ones: UK announced Uber has to treat drivers like employees not contractors, meaning their profits will be hurt. This does mean good news for Robotaxis, if and only if they can actually make them work profitably. Further, ""loos-id"" (don't think I can say this name here) is going public and Rivian is slated to go public this year as well. If these companies, or NKLA, or NIO or some other companies have significant and public blunders, Tesla stands to gain. 
However - some bearish catalysts are that those other companies are coming and if they DONT fuck up, they're just more competition in an increasingly crowded space. More choices means less profits for Tesla. Also, in case you guys forgot, Tesla is a pretty shitty company in terms of workers rights. They don't offer 401ks and they have been staunchly anti-union. Further, Elon basically forced people back to work during the pandemic and reopened the factories early despite governmental orders, and fired employees for not coming back into the office after having stated publicly they could remain at home. He might not have been directly involved in this, but Tesla sure was. While those have already eclipsed, it isn't a promising outlook for the future, and the breakneck speeds workers are being pushed to meet along with long hours to meet delivery targets are going to be very hard to maintain if they see worker fatigue and dropout. I'm not saying they're gonna miss targets, but there is a chance that workers unionize or otherwise strike/rebel and want more representation/compensation/work life balance. This would reduce delivery targets and decrease profit margins. Further, with a democratic party leading all branches, and pretty activist voices in some pretty powerful positions, companies like Amazon and Tesla that don't treat workers well may see legal/punitive backlash from the government if they don't change things themselves. I for one would be *popcorn meme* watching AOC and Elon duke it out on twitter over something like this. Also, Tesla is opening a new factory in India and there are factories in China, but these might not be as great as people think. India is in a lot of turmoil right now with the farmers revolt and there are some serious issues with the government there, along with China and the Uighurs. I would be not too surprised to see some sort of governmental sanctions or tightened restrictions on trade until these countries resolve those issues, which could spell bad news for Tesla. These countries are great new markets, but like the USA, they also have their own car manufacturers and other EV players - Tesla isn't going to have a monopoly anywhere so chill the fuck out.

So all of this paints my pretty grim picture for Tesla's stock price, but here's where I do my retard math. If you look at Yahoo finance for Tesla's book value, you get like $20/share. This takes into account all of Tesla's assets and liabilities. Now Tesla could take on more liabilities/debt in order to fund more R&D and drop their book value by doing so, but here's the thing - they have like $16B cash on deck to do that, and they haven't. I don't see them taking out massive loans that haven't been 'normal business procedure' for them in the coming year(s). So, take this book value and assume they grow at a rate of 50% year over year for 5 years straight (which would be fucking insane). This gives you like $154/share Book value. Now, let's look at their peers and their sector. EV as a whole is in a bubble IMO so I don't think it's really legitimate to compare to their EV peers (EV is the tech bubble, Tesla is the specific 'stock issue' in question affected most heavily because of name/brand recognition). So, compared to companies that have made cars longer than you or I have been alive (Toyota, VW, BMW, Honda, Daimler, Suzuki, Ford, GM) the average price to book ratio of those companies is 1.16. Tesla's is 35.25. If you take the insane growth figure I listed before (which represents 50% YoY TRUE growth in the company - averaged out over the 5 years to reduce any weirdness with new debt reducing book value) AND you add on a 125% INCREASE of the P/B ratio (so 225% raw) compared to their peers (this assumes they're 125% more pricey than their closest competitors, after insane growth for the next five years, meaning we're assuming basically fucking everything above goes right for Tesla) and you price all of that in TODAY you get a value of $401/share. Tesla is almost double that today. 

In my opinion, Tesla's true value lies around $100/share. With an assumption of 20% YoY growth of book value 5 years in a row and a 50% increase of P/B relative to peer average (Tesla is the P/B sector leader with this factor added on), you get $75/share. If you wanna be bullish and assume more goes right and things turn out better, call it $100 or $150. This 'book value' (and its growth expectation) wraps in things like profit margin and other fun little gotchas a lot of Tesla bulls like to point to saying how Tesla is supreme and much better than companies like Toyota which literally fucking created 'Lean Manufacturing' (it's called ""the Toyota way"") that transformed not just auto manufacturing, but any industry that remotely has anything to do with manufacturing in general. Put up against that, Tesla may be a maverick, but they have some big fucking shoes to fill and stiff competition. Anything more than $200/share and I think you're truly ignoring fundamentals and living in fantasy land like every other bubble occupant in the history of the stock market and human history. 

So where does that leave us, today? Well, Michael Burry, despite being pretty crazy, is actually pretty brilliant, and has been skeptical/short on Tesla long before I decided to jack myself to the tits (quantity wise, not so much cost) on cheap premie puts. I don't think anyone can truly time a bubble, and the actions that the Fed has been taking, along with upcoming stimulus checks and tax returns could prolong any 'top' well beyond its natural range. I could get totally fucked because of this but whatever, I didn't throw in more than I can afford to lose so whatever happens, happens, plus as a üåàüêª I'd probably deserve it anyways. The selloff that has happened over the past week I believe is the start of the 'blowoff' phase. We're on the way down now, it's just a matter of how long it can hang on, IMO. The big dip yesterday was our 'local bottom' until we ramp back up to the 'back to normal' section. If you're long Tesla, personally, I'd sell there. I do think short term there are some decent gains to be had if you buy now and hold for a week or two. I'm not an expert but I'm guessing in about a week or two we're back up near $800-820 and that'll be about the peak. After that, I think the stock loses steam and drops off to its natural level, wherever that ends up being (between $90 and $1600 if you listen to analysts, really insightful shit, really narrows it down). The bounce back today for me has more just confirmed the shape of the bubble and reactionary tendencies that people are pretty predisposed to, and kind of just confirms that the movement is based more on sentiment and human psychology than true fundamentals. I might be wrong about the timing, but I'm as close to certain as I've ever been about a stock that this is going to go to sub $200 levels in the next year. If I'm right, I'm buying a Tesla.

Positions - lots of 3/19 puts at different sub $300 strikes. Planning on buying more cheap OTM short term puts every month until this stock goes down or I go bankrupt. Sadly was a greedy fuck and didn't sell one 2/26 $590p during the big dip yesterday

I now have about 1,000 shares at an average strike price of $330 (wish I had bought more, haha). Turns out, I was right about the future and I don't plan to sell a single share for at least five years, maybe ten. I'm also not prepared to buy a whole bunch more TSLA because I need diversity in my investments at my age and I am probably a bit overweighted with this single stock. BUT, I still want to play. In preparation for this playtime, I've opened a margin and options account with my broker.

Hypothetically, if I believed that TSLA stock would trade at or above $720 per share on or before May 14, 2021, and hypothetically, if I was willing to risk 100 of my 1,000 shares on that prediction, is there an options contract I could create to capitalize?

I think Tesla (and daddy musk) has a long runway ahead especially if they‚Äôre going to grow productions 50% compounding YoY in auto sales which means that by Apple makes their first car in 2025, Tesla will be producing $2.5million electric vehicles. Their current automotive gross margins are 21% in comparison to 2.1% from Ford, gm, etc.

Tesla‚Äôs auto business: has a lot of potential and there‚Äôs a big runway in selling FSD which adds ~80% margin to every sale. 

Tesla insurance: they‚Äôre hiring actuaries everywhere so they can sell insurance to Tesla owners. One of the most important thing that ALL insurance companies want to know is HOW you drive. Usually they‚Äôll give you some discount to put in an obd sensor in your car for a few months and give you a rate accordingly. Now imagine a car that already does this so they know every action the driver takes and can understand risk every second on the road. Imagine an insurance company that can gather all camera feeds from the cars to evaluate accidents/damage claims and pass savings down to the customer. Win win. Huge potential.

Tesla Solar: with the new administration and their focus on renewable, solar will be front and center. With an existing relationship with over 1.3 million auto customers, Tesla will easily convert many of them to solar owner - FYI Tesla has the cheapest solar by a long margin. If even 10% of the total households in the US get basic solar added it‚Äôll equate to over $1T in yearly revenue.


Tesla Semi: this is one I‚Äôm super interested in. Walmart and other logistics businesses already bought thousands on back order. Compared to a 18 wheeler, a semi is 35% more efficient (and faster) meaning 35% or more reduction in transportation cost expanding margins for businesses. No brainer.

So, who is Kinder Morgan?

Kinder Morgan is one of the largest energy infrastructure companies in North America. We own an interest in or operate approximately 83,000 miles of pipelines and 147 terminals. Our pipelines transport natural gas, gasoline, crude oil, carbon dioxide (CO2) and more. Our terminals store and handle renewable fuels, petroleum products, chemicals, vegetable oils and **other products**. 

Now, almost everyone that knows Kinder Morgan knows them as one of the largest natural gas distributors/pipelines in the country.

2019 rankings (as 2020) are not out yet:

[https://www.aga.org/contentassets/d68b868b7cd94ed2889b704b441ab469/1002totvol.pdf](https://www.aga.org/contentassets/d68b868b7cd94ed2889b704b441ab469/1002totvol.pdf)

It is going to take a while for natural gas to get back to levels where it is profitable for drillers, but it is still being used and you need someone to distribute it.

$That is where $KMI comes into play and they are expanding the distribution and pipelines:

[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210104005083/en/Kinder-Morgan-Announces-Commercial-In-Service-of-Permian-Highway-Pipeline](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210104005083/en/Kinder-Morgan-Announces-Commercial-In-Service-of-Permian-Highway-Pipeline)

Ok, so you understand that they are big and move a lot of natural gas.

What they also do is handle logistics for other commodities and where we are concerned:

**STEEL, SCRAP and COKING COAL.**

Their terminals handle **59 BILLION TONS** of dry bulk goods annually.

$KMI's terminals are used to store and ship steel scrap, finished steel coils, slabs, coal etc.

Where this becomes juicy is China's entry into the US steel scrap market for the first time in many, many years.

Do you know who the largest exporter of scrap in the world is?

**THE UNITED STATES.**

This was talked about today on $CMC's conference call - China's desire for our scrap and the buying will soon start.

$KMI will be one of the main players exporting scrap and importing finished steel goods.

They also store product for US Steel manufacturers like $NUE.

So, I believe these terminals will be very busy exporting scrap and importing steel to be used in the manufacturing of automobiles and many other products in the US.

Just go to any financial statistics website and look at the PE ratio of the majority of the stocks inside ETFS like QQQ. Their PE ratio and net revenue / cash flow to stock prices are not actually up but either stable or slightly lower. The only exception to this rule are meme stocks like TSLA, GME etc. AAPL is an exception too but AAPL's net revenue is quickly catching up. But ETFs and tech stock market in general are not in a bubble, you are looking at less than a handful of stocks to make this determination.

You guys are also forgetting that we are currently undergoing a technology revolution like never before. Covid-19 put technology in the forefront and it's like the invention of the steam engine right now. Everything in tech and the cyberspace in particular is literally going to skyrocket in the upcoming years. People who are going full time in right now will be the winners and history will know it. Jury is out for if these meme stocks are overvalued too because we don't know their future potential (TSLA, NIO etc - minority of the tech stocks). What is happening right now is that safe money is moving out of stocks and either into bonds or cash. Because of inflation cash is going to take a huge hit in a year or so when we finally have the figures for how much Covid-19 cost us in American dollars. So not only will people miss out on the huge gains post-tech revolution but they will also take a big hit for holding cash.

I am not going to say if I am a financial expert or not. It is common sense. But I was never a part of these PLTR, GME and TLRY ponzi schemes. These people are worse than the hedge funds because they are just as greedy but far less educated / invested. It was a pyramid scheme where the first guy in took the most gains. I don't believe in something like a store that sells physical copies of video games to ever succeed rofl. Let's not forget Gamestop offering $3 for a game they would later sell for $40. All you bozos did was bail out the assholes that were invested in an asshole company and had poor retail investors take the hit for it. You people took advantage of depressed anxious jobless individuals and now many of them are left without much. I took a big hit from TSLA too (silly me). But I do believe in the cyberspace taking off big time in the upcoming years and it'd be the most valuable resource imaginable. You are seeing news right now about tech stocks being in a bubble over and over. You are also seeing news about some bond bullshit going up. It's the news that wants you to get out so the big whales can go in cheap - right before Biden administration goes all in on the clean energy and tech sector. Tech in the 1990s was nothing like it is now. India and China did not know what computers were back then, now every person has an iphone and tiktok in their hands. Cars are running on cyberspace/cloud that did not exist back then. Revenue of tech companies dwarfes the oil giants. Currency itself is produced using technology (Cryptos). Globalism / latest tech and the cloud itself has become the most valuable resource not just in America but also in India and China which have 10x our population. Instead of going to war for oil now we are spreading peace for likes.",8,0.53

Nothing has changed with Tesla other than two more giga-factories coming online this year and possibly launching the very first Semis along with the Cybertruck. Not only that, Tesla will potentially produce more vehicles in 2021 than over the entire life of Tesla.

Sounds like a busted growth story for the shorts and bears right?

2021-03-10 14:15:31,Iqiyi ($IQ) - the Netflix of China - poised to soar - TSLA all over again,"**TL;DR**

IQ is undervalued and technically promising. It has a cocktail of factors similar to TSLA 4 months ago before the 1000% rise. If it breaks out of its current trading range, it can soar very high.

**Fundamentals**

iQIYI is currently the #1 video streaming site in China. Truly the 'Netflix of China', it has more users than any other platform. Competition is intense - Tencent and Alibaba have competitor platforms - but iqiyi is still number 1, and that gives them the opportunity to grow their lead.

IQ is a growth stock, currently being valued as if it isn't. It's heavily in debt - as you'd hope all growth stocks would be - and it continues to invest in producing original content, at the expense of more tangible assets. They don't seem to care about profit, and have very rough financials. This is typical for growth stocks with a high valuation - the valuation is usually based on speculation about the future. However, IQ has a low valuation. Speculation about the future is *not priced in*. Its market cap is just $22b. It is currently being viewed like a struggling company - which it isn't. This means it is highly susceptible to a huge change in valuation, just by viewing it as a growth stock and pricing in the value of the huge array of exclusive content, and more users than any other platform. This current valuation is insane.

IQ is also being shorted, based on some very, very, uninformed claims ('[faking their numbers](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/08/iqiyi-accused-of-fraud-by-wolfpack-muddy-waters.html)' - a company surveyed people in China and basically didn't find as many using Iqiyi as their numbers would suggest. A completely unreliable unscientific study that used a tiny sample size (1500) and drew sweeping conclusions, aided by a single ex-employee, and some unspecified *'data'*, this is garbage, probably produced for self-promotion purposes among the Sinophobic investment crowd. This study launched an SEC investigation, which heavily suppressed the stock price, but the whole thing is simply ridiculous). Regardless, shorts get squeezed when the price goes up, whether they're right or wrong.

**TECHNICALS**

*IQ has been in a trading range for 2 years

*It has just closed at the very top of that range.

*Momentum has been VERY strong approaching this level - rising almost every day, even when related stocks/indicies fell.

If it breaks out of the range, it will soar - due to: 

1. The technicals (the end of the trading range leading to a breakout)
2. The short squeeze
3. That price rise causing reevaluation as a growth stock and pricing in the intangible assets.
4. Then, renewed interest and maybe even the hype it deserves.

**SUMMARY**

This is a growth stock being wrongfully viewed as a struggling company, beset by shorts and in a trading range for 2 years. This is *essentially the exact same scenario that Tesla ($TSLA) was in 4 months ago*, before its 1000% rise. If it breaks out, it can go very high.

If it doesn't break out, it will likely go down to the $15-$17 area at the bottom of the range. Trading ranges do continue more than they change, but it's hard to see that happening now.",15,0.65
2021-02-11 10:30:29,[TSLA] Pelosi leaps playbook,"You may have all heard that Pelosi's husband bought [1m in tsla calls.](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/ptr-pdfs/2021/20018011.pdf) last month.

Maybe some of you are getting sick of chasing after GME and APHA wrecked your asses and wanna play some real stocks IDK.

I believe that bets are best placed BEFORE the stock is at ATH, so I think this is a good time to post this while TSLA is going through some dips.

There is a lot to talk about when it comes to everyone's favorite CEO, but I think the biggest headwinds are these:

1. EV credits are coming
2. FSD beta currently being used by 1000 lucky(?) Tesla drivers.
3. The House Majority Leader Pelosi bought leaps. 
4. *censored topic here*

I don't wanna make this really long, so I just want to go over what exactly she bought.

25 contracts [$500 strike expiring at March 18, 2022](https://imgur.com/Nlw4PWZ) 

Note that she's actually down about 30k on these as of today. Are you mad about politicians insider trading? Well holy fuck you have a chance to get in at LESS than what she paid.

This is what her payout looks like: https://imgur.com/blP7gLZ

Basically she can't lose any money unless TSLA closes below $940 in by March 2022. However, you will notice that the leverage applied is only 1~2x. Basically this is like baby leverage vs holding shares.

I wanted to entertain some alternatives. So what if you got bigger balls and say TSLA doubles from here at the minimum? https://imgur.com/ZZGDYUN

You can see the upside is so much higher but tsla has to move a lot fast to outrun the theta burn.

So what if you thought about theta and want to spread it instead? (A spread is when you buy a call then sell a call further otm.) https://imgur.com/HoPgNl1

You probably noticed here that payout distribution gets bigger as you get close to expiration. Personally I think this is a better play than ITM calls, but of course, if TSLA pulls another 5x from here, nothing beats the uncapped upside of plain calls.

At the end of the day however, if TSLA just goes down 10% from here and doesn't come back for a year, all of these are expiring worthless. Btw kind of fucking crazy that if you have 100 TSLA shares you can collect almost guaranteed 60% a year. 

Did you buy GME because you hate the establishment and their privileged trading free money? Well, they're doing this one in broad daylight. Would you take it? 

Also not financial advice. Gamble your chrome money at your own risk.

2021-02-23 08:04:29,Case for TSLA 2030,"Case for tesla long term:

Its a lot of speculation.  But we have an idea what tesla is targeting.  And we have teslas track record for the past 10 years or so.

20M deliveries by 2030.  Power revenues equal to auto revenues.  Plus robo taxis.  Not to mention anything else like service, superchargers, insurance, possible air craft down the road, etc.

So you can use that, 30% margins on autos, avg selling prices of say $25k. To get auto revenues estimates.  Double that revenue for power.  Then multiple by a probability of success.

Robo taxis are a real outlier that could possibly double both of those or be equal to zero.

So its really difficult to assign value. Which is why the stock is so volatile.

The high price is due to tesla historically high success at hitting 50% CARG since 2012.  Just try carrying forward 30% CARG for 10 years and see what estimates that gives you.

As such market is expecting tesla to do well.  Production is lined up for 1M autos this year to not be an unreasonable number, double of 2020.

Do all the above and assign a price multiple to the revenue.

So teslas track is strong, its history is strong, and its potential is even stronger.


So do the math.  20M autos at 25k sale price yields 500B in revenue.  Double that to include power potential, so $1T in revenue.  30% margins leaves us with 300B in profits (assuming they can get earnings to near equal auto margins, they currently do NOT).  A 20 P/E gives us $6T market cap.  This ignores robo taxis.

So $6000 a share by 2030, assuming no robo taxi revenue, production hit targets, and 20 P/E.  Obviously a lot of risk to these targets though.

Alternatively, 40% CARG (tesla has had 50% since they IPO'd) would put 2030 revenue at $896B.  Not far off from the above.


Big questions are

1) can it hit/maintain 30% margins as EVs race to the bottom on prices/commodize.  Apple has done well with phones but autos may be more difficult, idk

2) can it turn revenue into profits equal to 30% profit margins.  Current earnings are no where near the declared auto profit margins. 

3) can it scale manufacturing fast enough to hit target with batteries being a big limitation, driven by limits in battery supply chains, which they have to take in house and reinvent to achieve 

4) is a 20 P/E reasonable.  If not what is?  Most autos are much less then this.  But most autos have terrible debt positions and near no growth.  

5) biggest what if, can they make robo taxis a global thing?  How will that affect revenue and margins?

May be a good time to BUY THE DIP

This Wednesday TSLA has earnings, and they will have a reveal as well. Earnings are after hours. That being said, there are a few reasons to get in now.

A new product is coming, which will be revealed Wednesday. I believe this is the case because of Elon‚Äôs twitter activity. Also l, I haven‚Äôt heard shit about Tesla in the news aside from S&P 500 inclusion, so it‚Äôs time Elon makes sure papa Bezos doesn‚Äôt pass him up. 

POSSIBLE NEW PRODUCTS

1.) NEW BATTERY 
    
     
Tesla has been working on new battery tech after realizing they will run out of 3rd party supply by 2022. It‚Äôs been in the works for a while, and it‚Äôs needed for them to move forward as a company. QS tendies are nothing compared to TSLA battery tendies. Also, if you were here for the battery day disaster, here‚Äôs your shot at retribution.

[battery day 2.0](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.teslarati.com/tesla-4680-battery-cell-production-elon-musk-alien-dreadnought/amp/)

This is likely the best case scenario. 

2.)25k car (Unlikely)
The $25,000 car is expected to hit production in 2022. Cheaper car = more people can buy it. Stock goes up. This is dependent on the battery being completed first, in which case the battery and 25k car are both introduced. 

3.) Model S/X refresh 


Here‚Äôs some drone footage from one of the factories. Footage shows a different production method, and they‚Äôre clearly trying to hide the products.

Congress and media will use Robinhood as the scapegoat but the real issue here is Citadel.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Robinhood deserves all the shit it‚Äôs going to get thrown at. After ‚Äúthe call‚Äù with Citadel, Vlad could‚Äôve told them to fuck off, ‚ÄúWe built Robinhood for the people.‚Äù He could‚Äôve raised margins to 100% for those stocks, something reasonable, but no he caved into Citadel‚Äôs request. But destroying Robinhood isn‚Äôt going to stop the problem.

For those of you that don‚Äôt know, Citadel is a Market Maker. They are literally the definition of Market Manipulation. I‚Äôm not going to explain that to you, look it up. All done now? Good we can move on. They make their money selling option contracts. How is that manipulating the market you ask? Well, it is when you have brokers like Robinhood selling you data and you working with shorts keeping prices down. Why else do you think they bailed out Melvin? Connect the dots you autists!

Nothing will happen with them anytime soon because they have paid off everyone that could expose them. Everyone on Wallstreet knows this, everyone in government knows this. Yes even AOC, even fuckin Ted Cruz who‚Äôs just clout chasing (His wife‚Äôs a top exec at GS, he knows this shit, he knows nothing is going to happen.) AOC hinted of this during her Twitch stream yesterday. Congress has BS committees whose job is to ‚Äúmake money.‚Äù They even paid off Janet Yellen. She ain‚Äôt no JPow.

Your natural follow up question is ‚Äúokay how do we stop Citadel if they have so much pull?‚Äù The simple answer ‚Äúbuy fuckin TSLA because Elon is papa.‚Äù I‚Äôm not going to bore you with all the TSLA DD because they‚Äôre all over this subreddit and all over twitter. If you fuckin reply with gordon johnson, teslacharts, or mark spiegel, fuck off you really are a retard. The only thing I will touch upon is FSD. Listen to the earnings call. Elon says they‚Äôll start offering FSD subscription in 1-2 months for $200 per month. I‚Äôll do the math for you autists taking into account that only 20% of drivers will pay for that (that‚Äôs a lowball number). There‚Äôs currently roughly 1 million Teslas on the road capable of FSD.

[https://www.statista.com/statistics/502208/tesla-quarterly-vehicle-deliveries/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/502208/tesla-quarterly-vehicle-deliveries/)

If you take a 20% FSD take rate of those 1 million Teslas, that‚Äôs 480mil revenue yearly just from FSD alone the first year. This is not including the 800k+ deliveries expected this year. By 2025, when there‚Äôs roughly 5 million Teslas on the road, FSD revenue will be about 2.4 billion annually.  Don‚Äôt listen to all the FUD on how Tesla missed EPS or auto margin % is down. Those analysts are missing the big picture. This is why even Elon himself said Tesla is well worth the 1 trillion valuation

Okay let‚Äôs get back on track because those of you who made it here want to know how to expose Citadel. Not only are they a Market Maker, they‚Äôre a known Tesla Market Maker.

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/hedge-fund-citadel-discloses-huge-stake-tesla-stock-51587762771](https://www.barrons.com/articles/hedge-fund-citadel-discloses-huge-stake-tesla-stock-51587762771)

They‚Äôve been manipulating the price on Tesla for years. The media have helped make their jobs much easier. Watch CNBC, that‚Äôs all the evidence you need. You know who else is short Tesla that connects all of this with GME? You guessed it: Melvin fuckin Capital. 

[https://lostinthoughtt.medium.com/elon-musk-tweets-about-gme-because-melvin-capital-shorted-tsla-for-years-6d00512080c5](https://lostinthoughtt.medium.com/elon-musk-tweets-about-gme-because-melvin-capital-shorted-tsla-for-years-6d00512080c5)

Where do you think all that money that Citadel is bailing Melvin out with is going to go? Yup shorting Tesla. Who else is going to benefit from that? If you guessed Citadel, come on down and get your free stock. Before I get to my next point, let‚Äôs take a look at Tesla short interest.

[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/short-interest](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/short-interest)

As of 1/15, there is still 56mil shares shorted. That‚Äôs a whopping 46-47 billion $ worth of shorts (3x that of GME). To add on to those shorts, there‚Äôs also a new ‚Äúsynthetic short‚Äù made by Tesla joining the SP500. To summarize for you, there are active funds which track the performance of SP500. At the end of the year, they‚Äôre judge by how well they do with respect to the index. A surprising amount of them still do not own Tesla so YTD, they are well behind the index due to not owning any Tesla. A good amount of them are waiting until post Q4 earnings (now) to buy shares thus creating a ‚Äúsynthetic short.‚Äù

How do we get the ball rolling? The same idea as GME, buy what TSLA you want, force Citadel to start having to buy shares for their calls, get these synthetic shorts to start buying and you can probably guess what happens next. This time, if they decide to pull the same shit, they can‚Äôt say they‚Äôre ‚Äúprotecting the investor‚Äù because Tesla ‚Äúis‚Äù a great investment. Congress and Joe can‚Äôt say they‚Äôre for climate change if they‚Äôre going to choose the likes of Citadel over Tesla. 

With that, I want to end this and remind you again to NOT FUCKIN SELL GME. If you have to take, some profits from the rest of your portfolio. I‚Äôm selling everything else in my portfolio and going all in on TSLA and GME.

2021-02-16 07:59:47,Weekly Stock Market News | TLRY / PLTR / TSLA / DIS / AAPL / GM & other Stock Market News [02-16],"**The stock market finished another great week at record highs. Investors turn even more bullish with semiconductors & pot skyrocketing. Let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of last week, as we saw all 3 major indexes finish at all time highs with the [Dow Jones](https://imgur.com/9QkK5ca) gaining 1% for the week, while the [SP500](https://imgur.com/o3g9vaq) rose by 1.2% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://imgur.com/TMdS1Ly) outperformed rising 1.7%, as 8 of the 11 [sectors](https://imgur.com/VejvtiI) finished the week with gains, with Utilities and Consumer Discretionary losing over 1%, but it‚Äôs important to note that the Volatility [Index](https://imgur.com/qFVLzd6) also closed at the lowest level in almost a year, as it closed under 20 on Friday.

[HERE](https://imgur.com/cvTchF7) is the HEAT MAP from last week, that shows pretty mixed results, with semiconductors & financials popping while the rest of the stock market had mixed results.

We also saw some interest economic data last week, as the TD Ameritrade January [Index](https://imgur.com/V78bPVC) came in at 6.91, up over 10% over December as most retail investors bought Apple, AMD & AT&T. The other interesting number that we received was the investor sentiment [survey](https://imgur.com/Pi3tk6d), which showed what I was expecting, as it came in with a more bullish view of the retail investors as I predicted last week, which is one thing to look at as a contrarian indicator, so right now, I‚Äôm not really adding anything to my portfolio, but I am still gathering some cash for the next correction/pullback.

In terms of Job numbers, we saw Job [Openings](https://imgur.com/URoCI4p) in December coming in slightly better than expectations as the job opening rate stood at 4.5% while the jobless [claims](https://imgur.com/Ouf4H1d) came in down almost 20k vs last week but was higher than expected by analyst as the number of continuing jobless claim grew by over 50K.

This [week](https://imgur.com/1foTccl) is pretty quiet in term of economic data, with only jobless claims and some preliminary numbers of the PMIs while on the [earnings](https://imgur.com/rySV2ud) front, we do have a couple of interesting ones left with names like Shopify, Fastly, Roku, Walmart, Fiverr & many others reporting.

In some other stock market news, we saw pot stocks torching the market towards new highs in the beginning of the week, only to [crumble](https://imgur.com/TNZOw4X) on Thursday, but still, most of the stocks managed to finish the week with very big gains. We can see that the [ETF](https://imgur.com/XgntUvu) for these stocks has crushed the markets and has almost doubled already this year. This hole spike started after Tilray announced an agreement with Grow Pharma for a [deal](https://imgur.com/TuznO0z) in the UK and of [course](https://imgur.com/21Lt9F2) the ‚Äúchatter‚Äù on Reddit‚Äôs biggest stock market forum. And by the way, it‚Äôs still interesting to watch the Aphria/Tilray merger developments, to see if either Aphria spikes again, or if Tilray goes down to counteract the current 30% discount on the merger.

Meanwhile, despite popping on Monday after a [new](https://imgur.com/xwv5lEU) partnership with IBM which will be available starting in March, Palantir finished the week more than 5%, ahead of the Q4 earnings results that will be announced this morning, and should be interesting to watch if they sustain the huge rise of the stock in the past months. (Later edit: PLTR beat on revenue but posted an unexpected loss of $0.06/share)

We also saw numbers from Tesla‚Äôs China [sales](https://imgur.com/fc8gduC), which more than doubled in 2020 and now stand at 21% of their total sales at almost $7B, as the model 3 was the best-selling electric car in China in 2020. Tesla also slumped last [week](https://imgur.com/KNzzLHK), despite popping on Monday after the disclosure of $1.5B in digital currency assets bought in January, as more [analysts](https://imgur.com/eMxGtXU) are pointing to a potential battery cell supply shortage in the future for EV companies.

Regarding earnings reports, there were a couple of interesting one‚Äôs last week, with Disney [posting](https://imgur.com/4x7GFjt) a surprise profit of $0.32 and beating on revenues, as Disney+ subscribers are nearing the 100M mark, while the current total direct-to-consumer subs stand at 146M. This helped the company return to profitability after just one quarter of negative [results](https://imgur.com/kvEjJN3), which is incredible given the big hit taken by the rest of their revenue streams.

Apple also had an interesting week after [reports](https://imgur.com/wHUEKv9) that they are not in talks with Hyundai, Kia on developing a self-driving electric car, while JP Morgan [speculated](https://imgur.com/UX2MvzG) they might partner with Renault, and pointed to a couple of interesting things, like Renault‚Äôs 1million units of excess capacity, their track record with contract manufacturing and the flexibility this might give Apple to having a bigger input on the manufacturing process. It‚Äôs also to be noted that this could be a nice synergy for them, as Renault & Nissan have struggled with their EV products, so this could provide a big presence across key regions for both of the companies, while also offering premium products, as Apple pretty much stands for premium offerings. Though, it‚Äôs still very [unclear](https://imgur.com/IYjOfBX) which way Apple will go, but it‚Äôs pretty safe to say, they are definetly moving forward with this project.

Also, regarding earnings reports we did have a couple of interesting ones, as the recent green energy favorite, [Enphase](https://imgur.com/tvpnxk0) beat expectations by $0.11, as the stock popped on better-than-expected guidance for the next quarter.

We also saw [Twitter](https://imgur.com/KQb4ClB) beating expectations for the quarter on the top and bottom line, but disappointed on monetizable daily users which came in 1.5M lower than expected, though this didn‚Äôt stop the stock to pop to new highs at over $70.

Meanwhile, [GM](https://imgur.com/Yk0tdaK) also posted great beats on the earnings report as the company showcased an EBIT 20% beat than expected, but this didn‚Äôt help the stock as it sold off after the report that it may also be high be the global chip shortage, as this has made big companies like [NVIDIA](https://imgur.com/oVFjne0) to bring back older products to meet the insane demand for semiconductors.

One last piece of news for the week was that Qualcomm unveiled their [new](https://imgur.com/vrKYXlS) 5G modem to compete in this new 5G rush, while also [objecting](https://imgur.com/9epoJGz) to NVIDIA possible ARM acquisition, as this could possibly limit other chipmakers accessing the intellectual property possessed by ARM, as this is used in 95% of the world‚Äôs smartphones.

So, let‚Äôs hope for a good week in the stock markets again, as we have to keep an eye on what big companies like Walmart & Shopify announce later in the week.

Almost all of the analysts are valuing TSLA purely on automotive revenue.

They are not looking at the actual product, which is ENERGY.

What does TSLA do?

* ENERGY GENERATION
* ENERGY STORAGE
* ENERGY ARBITRAGE
* ENERGY DECENTRALIZATION
* ENERGY AS TRANSPORTATION

2021-01-14 19:36:45,TODAY TSLA quietly launched its own solar power inverter. ENPH & SEDG's 3 year DUOPOLY ENDs. DD,"**EARLY   TLDR: Today Tesla quietly launched its very own solar power inverter.   This wasn't announced until today. This is the first real threat to  ENPH  and SEDG's duopoly (and their subsequent absurd x30-x200 rise in  the  last 2 years). BUY ENPH or SEDG PUTS/SHORTS asap.**

Ok retards, I've been following the solar space for some time and I just had to write something before others do.

**Background - The reason behind SolarEdge and Enphase's meteoric rise.**

As   you can see in the charts below, ENPH and SEDG have rallied like crazy   the last couple of years. ENPH especially... it went from under $1 to   $208 as of today. Although ENPH was sort of a turnaround story, the  real  reason behind their rise was due to regulation (NEC 2017) that  required  rapid shutdown devices on solar systems in the US. This  basically  killed chinese and other inverter manufacturers in the US  that didn't  have module level hardware. Long story short, it created a  beautiful  duopoly in the residential solar market in the US during a  rapid growth  in the industry.

**Current Valuations of SEDG & ENPH**

I'm   not going to get into the financials etc, but SEDGs P/E is 99 and   ENPH's is 163. Enough said. Of course the whole sector has rallied with   DEM win and recently with the senate upset. Fine. But this rise, like   EV's, is frothy as hell.

Having  said that, I wouldn't typically recommend anyone short or buy puts on any of the  solar names (RUN, JKS, CSIQ, DQ, SEDG, ENPH, TAN, ICLN, etc etc).   They were overvalued 3 months ago. They can keep going up up and up. As  a  lot of people have been posting here recently, the clean energy ETFs   have done incredibly well. HOWEVER with ENPH & SEDG's.....

**Besides like Apple or Amazon, what's the WORST company to suddenly become your competitor...?**

TESLA obviously. Elon Musk is the only guy that keeps bald nerd-turned-into Vin diesel looking mfer Bezos awake at night.

With   big dog Tesla entering the space, and becoming a DIRECT COMPETITOR out   of nowhere to ENPH and SEDG, this changes things. For those invested  in  any of the solar names, it's time to hedge by buying some ENPH/SEDG   puts. For any degenerates looking for a quick buck, ENPH and SEDG will   most certainly start coming down to reasonable valuations. You heard it   here first, this is the END OF THE DUOPOLY. Once chinese manufacturers   get back into this space, then it'll get commodified like the solar   panel guys (hello <10 P/Es).

**PS: TAN and ICLN's biggest holdings are SEDG & ENPH...**

Happy   Hunting Retards. For ENPH Longs... Please don't give me shit about  ""but enphase has micro-inverters, they are better than central inverter  blah  blah blah"". Don't be like the sleazy solar sales guys that knock  doors  in Long Island every week. Customers don't care if its micro vs.   string inverters. They care about price and brand recognition. From   Electrek *""Finally, the greatest   advantage (although it‚Äôs uncertain) is potentially the cost. Tesla could   potentially be able to achieve a better cost than the competition by   leveraging its already large power electronic production capacity for   its electric vehicles and charging stations.""* Price will certainly  be lower than ENPH or SEDG. You think anyone knows wtf enphase or  solaredge is? They all know what Tesla is, they have one parked in your  mom's house.",155,0.93

2021-02-25 09:32:54,Some basic TSLA Tech Analysis for you Smooth-Brained Apes,"So, TSLA, along w/ the rest of the Tech stocks is on a downward trajectory, which leads to the obvious question: When does it stop so I can buy in and maximize my upside potential?

I took a look at some historical Moving Averages to get an idea of how far this may go and my initial conclusions are below:

1. Crashed through the 50-day SMA on 21 Feb and has stayed >10% below since.  This MA has historically been TSLA's support level and staying below leads me to think it may be here a while.
2. 100-day SMA is the next logical support level, which is $625 so I'll be watching closely to see if the downward trajectory continues at the same rate, or starts to level out as it approaches that 100-day SMA support level.

The stock is at $688 now so that 100-day SMA isn't really far off and it could rebound sharply so set your alerts and/or limits, raid your wife's boyfriend's wallet, and hang on for a fun, and potentially lucrative opportunity.

Initially I had it set at $700/share, but thought others might have set that price, so settled on $695.  As the market closed, the stock price didn't go up the max 10% I thought might happen.  However, when I checked my portfolio.  The sell order went through!  lol someone had a market buy order for all of my shares!

I still hold the majority of my shares in my individual trading account as I don't want to pay taxes yet.  Closed out most of my near term calls for about $400k profit but still holding a bunch that are deep in the money.  CNBC is showing my sell price as the closing price!  In fact, TSLA would be up after hours if it wasn't for my sale lol

Let‚Äôs get ready to tumble! Come Monday, $TSLA enters the S&P 500, as the world is aware. This is the one you will tell your grandkids about, or at least the new crop of investors, wondering what the bubble of 2020 was like. Tesla can be your example of the insanity....1/ 

For all of the cost-saving benefits of passive investing, the Standard & Poor‚Äôs committee that actively chooses the components for its indices will prove why passive investors are the dumb money with this coming Monday‚Äôs inclusion of $TSLA into its venerable S&P 500 index. 2/ 

The committee is not known for a price consciousness. It chases what‚Äôs hot and eliminates from its august roster what‚Äôs not. 3/ 

It‚Äôs disregard for fundamentals or value was seen sharply in late 1999 & early 2000 when bubble darlings like Peoplesoft, New Century Energy, Global Crossing, Xilinx, Teradyne, Quintiles Transnational, Citrix and JDS Uniphase made their way into the index. 4/ 

Pull up the long-term charts to see how these ‚Äútimely‚Äù additions fared post admittance. The most prominent additions in 1999 were America Online (discussed in my 12/5 thread) and Yahoo, whose mania also reminds me of Tesla... 5/ 

Yahoo went public in 1996, priced at $13 per share, opened at $24.50 and closed at $33 on its first trading day, a market cap of $850 million. From there the shares zoomed ahead by more than 6x in 2 years reaching $354 in January 1999. 6/ 

The company then bought Geocities for $3.6B and Broadcast for $5.7B and the stock was more than cut in half, trading down to $120. Recovering by late 1999, the wizards at S&P announced they would add Yahoo to the index on 11/30/1999. 7/ 

The stock climbed 67% from $210 on the day of the announcement to $350 on the day of its inclusion on 12/7, one week later. Sound familiar? The rollercoaster didn‚Äôt high point for another month. 8/ 

Yahoo peaked not quite a month later at a share price of $475, a market cap of $127B on January 3, 2000 (the cap didn‚Äôt include another 124 million option shares, 38M granted in 1999 alone, which implied an additional \~$50B in market cap on January 3, 2000). 9/ 

In hindsight, or for anyone with reason, which was lacking in those days, there was no need to count the fully diluted shares. Why? Those options would not be exercised. The stock fell 98.3% over the next 1 ¬æ years, from $475 to $8.11 on 9/26/2001, a market cap of $2.2B. Yep. 10/ 

At the peak, Yahoo's $127B market cap compared to $600 million in trailing 12-month revenues, so 211 times revenues. 11/ 

But the Yahoo and tech bulls would get right in your face (or on the Yahoo Finance message board) and tell you, moron, that sales had grown 141%, 248%, 258% and 1,345% in the prior 4 years, which they did. 12/ 

Heck, even after the stock dropped from a STOCK PRICE of $475 to $30 (a mere 93.7% in a year for those counting) by the end of 2000, sales still GREW by 88% to $1.1B, to ‚Äúonly‚Äù 15 times revenues! From there, however, the company flailed. 13/ 

Sales actually fell 35%, from $1.1B to $717m from 2000 to 2001, which is what drove the shares down to $8.11 and a $2.2B market cap. To what had been the first and dominant home page, and really the dominant search engine, competition came fast. 14/ 

Yahoo even eventually outsourced its search function to upstart Google if you can believe that. Yahoo did ultimately grow its revenues another 5x to $5B by 2016, when it was bought by Verizon $VZ in 2016 for $4.5B, excluding a sub's partial investment in Alibaba. 15/ 

The buyout was at a far cry from the day Yahoo came into the S&P 500 as the 30th largest capitalization in the index, with a market cap of roughly $90B and I‚Äôd guess at a weight of 0.7%. 16/ 

At its January 3, 2000 peak, Yahoo had climbed to the #15 spot in the index, well ahead of Berkshire Hathaway $BRKA $BRKB (which was not yet in the index despite its mere $83B market cap, $131B in assets and $38B in shareholders equity.) 17/ 

Had Berkshire been in the index the day Yahoo peaked it would have held only the 37 spot, behind notorious tech darlings Cisco at $358B, Intel $290B, Time Warner $184B, Lucent $171B Sun Mico $168B, AT&T $160B, WorldCom $148B, Dell $130B, HP $120B, Oracle $120B, EMC $116B,... 18/ 

Qualcomm $116B, DirecTV $102B, Verizon $93B, AOL $93B, Motorola $90B, and Bellsouth $87B. Many of these are gone today, which leads us back to $TSLA. 19/ 

Never has the S&P 500 committee brought in a company so large by market cap as will be the case with Tesla's inclusion. Nor have they ever brought in a company at so high a spot in the cap-weighted index, at #6, one notch ahead of Berkshire Hathaway. Insanity. 20/ 

Of course, by sales & profits, plenty of companies have entered the index as larger constituents, but that‚Äôs not what counts in the passive index. It‚Äôs all about float adjusted market cap. Fundamental valuation matters not. Qualifying for index inclusion required some hijinks.21/ 

Tesla had cut R&D & SG&A, drew on reserves and leaned on environmental carbon credits to ‚Äúearn‚Äù a GAAP profit for a necessary four quarters. They did so for five. Oddly, revenues only grew 15% in 2019, prior to the pandemic, in part for a reduction in customer tax incentives. 22/ 

Impressively, they have grown revenues 15% for the first 9 months of 2020 during the crisis while the incumbents saw sales decline. No doubt the business is growing. But how to value it? 23/ 

On November 16, the S&P index committee announced Tesla would be added on December 21. The market cap was $380B. Here on Saturday December 19, the stock price at $695 yields a market cap of $659B ($BRK, the current #6 is $528B) up $279B or 73% since the announcement. 24/ 

The gain matches the percentage rise seen by Yahoo during the week between its announcement & addition. The $279B gain is LARGER than the $215B market cap of the world‚Äôs largest auto manufacturer, Toyota. Tesla‚Äôs $659B cap is on 948M shares out at 9/30 (up 5% since YE 2019). 25/ 

The share count excludes another 157M unvested or unexercised option and RSU shares, which would add more than $100B to the market cap on a fully diluted basis. 26/ 

Let‚Äôs not count those for the same reason they were excluded in the Yahoo calculation. Why? Many may go unexercised. Why? Nobody in their right mind would pay $659B, $760B diluted, for a car co w/ $30B in sales, little or no economic profit and an enormous growth capital need.27/ 

25x sales? 2,030x GAAP earnings? 422x earnings assuming Toyota‚Äôs best in industry 6% profit margin? Heck, even 85 times Microsoft‚Äôs 30% profit margin (a bone for the Tesla is not a car company but also a software/robotaxi crowd). Welcome to the game, index fund investors. 28/ 

80% of Tesla‚Äôs shares float, not owned by insiders, which means the adjusted market cap weight will be $528B, compelling somewhere between $50 and $75B of direct index purchases, not to mention those needed by index huggers and closet indexers. 29/ 

The stock will come in at \~1.75% of the $30.5 trillion index, itself significantly overvalued, not unlike when Yahoo peaked in January 2000 and the index peaked at over 30x earnings and 44x cyclically adjusted (CAPE) shortly thereafter. 30/ 

What prospective return does the Tesla bull expect, or the passive investor with 1.75% of capital in the shares come Monday? At 15% a year, the market cap, assuming no further dilution, grows to $3T over the next decade, \~10% of the market value of the entire S&P 500 today. 31/ 

At ‚Äúonly‚Äù 10% per year, the fully diluted market cap grows to $2 trillion, almost where $AAPL is valued these days. At a 10% shareholder return, to trade at 30x earnings, Tesla will need to be earning $67 billion. 32/ 

For grins let‚Äôs assume the company actually earns some blend of auto maker profit (most earn \~3%, Toyota \~6%) and a subscription software, robotaxi margin of 30%. Generously call it a 20% blended profit margin, which I‚Äôd bet heavily against. 33/ 

At the impossible 20% margin, $67B would sit under $335B in revenues, roughly 11 times today‚Äôs run rate. Revenues will need to grow by almost 28% per year, and profits to 20% of revenues, to get to a 30x multiple on earnings. 34/ 

To finance the necessary capital stock to produce $335B in revenues will require about half that much in capital, either debt or equity. 35/ 

Car companies require roughly a dollar in capital to produce a dollar in revenues, but remember we are ""assuming"" this is a software company or whatever else hallucinogens conjure up in the minds of bulls. 36/ 

The best course of action for Tesla is to keep selling ‚Äúat-the-market‚Äù blocks, with no prospectus, road show or risk warning, to the dumb money that is willing, or compelled, as is the passive crowd, to pay dangerous prices. The dilution at today‚Äôs prices is infinitesimal. 37/ 

Through the end of 2019 Tesla had sold $12.7B in shares and borrowed $16B in debt and preferred stock. Total capital raised of $28B exceeded FY 2019 revenues of $25B and produced a $6B cumulative LOSS. 38/ 

So far in 2020, Tesla has borrowed an additional net $200m and sold $12.3B of new shares (assuming a sale of the most recent $5B ‚Äúat-the-market‚Äù). Bulls revere the cash on the balance sheet, but it didn‚Äôt come from profit or free cash. 39/ 

Total capital raised is now $40B before retained losses. What does Tesla earn on capital? Nothing yet. Equity is less than capital raised from stock sales by the amount of cumulative losses. Per share book is of course higher thanks to successful stock sales way above book...40/ 

From a business case and investment standpoint, the math doesn‚Äôt work. Consider that total automobiles sold worldwide peaked two years ago at about 95m passenger and commercial car and truck units. At $20,000 per new vehicle, we can call the global auto market $2T in size. 41/ 

Our example has Tesla‚Äôs market cap growing over the next decade at ‚Äúonly‚Äù 10% per year to a like $2T. Car companies, with the exception of Ferrari, which makes three cars per year, don‚Äôt trade for one times sales. They trade for less. 42/ 

Toyota, which earns a 6% margin and 6% on capital, trades itself at an all-time-high $215B on revenues of $280B in 2019, less in 2020. 43/ 

Auto manufacturers trade for less than sales because they make \~3% net margins and earn that same \~3% on capital and revenues grow at \~3%. We can call the industry 3x3x3 (new material here folks). The car business is a bad business, and that‚Äôs what Tesla is trying to disrupt? 44/ 

The best case for shareholders: If Tesla grows the aforementioned sales for the next decade by 28% to $335B (it won‚Äôt), the stock will trade for no more than 1x sales, because it‚Äôs a CAR company. 45/ 

If it earns Toyota‚Äôs best in class 6% margin, even allowing for software ‚Äúupgrades,‚Äù it earns $20B and trades for 25x, or a $500B market cap, which is a 33% loss from here people using diluted shares. If sales, margins or the multiple are lower, shareholders lose more. 46/ 

The realistic case: The performance of the stock from here is a giant loss over time and the Tesla cult loses interest in the brand. In fact, they come to hate the brand because of their coming stock losses, customer and employee mistreatment. 47/ 

Ask the guys and gals on the S and X lines about their unpaid ‚Äúbreak‚Äù here at quarter end. Rumor has it they can ""volunteer their time"" to help boost production before yearend. Sales grow nowhere near 28% a year. The incumbent auto manufacturers won‚Äôt roll over and play dead. 48/ 

My prior tweet elaborated on [@elonmusk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) using his inflated shares as currency to acquire another manufacturer w/ capacity, as he mentioned he‚Äôd be up for in a friendly merger of equals. The point of that message was that the incumbents won‚Äôt take his dangerous scrip in a deal. 49/ 

That leaves Elon with having to sell new shares perpetually to finance his growth. It makes 100% sense when the shares are insanely overvalued to do so, and despite the ethics of doing so in these recent at-the-market deals. 50/ 

By contrast, Mr. Buffett points out he‚Äôd prefer new and current shareholders to have a fair experience in his company‚Äôs shares. If the auto makers won‚Äôt take them in a deal, and they shouldn‚Äôt, then that leaves new shareholders to provide growth capital. Hello passive crowd. 51/ 

We‚Äôll see what happens after Monday, when Tesla assumes the #6 perch in the index. When the argument for passive is low fees, remind me in ten years how much of the loss in Tesla‚Äôs shares from here should be considered a ‚Äúfee,‚Äù or a tax on stupidity. 52/ 

At 1.75% of the index, a decline of 80-90% would be heavy, but realistic. Impossible to decline that much? An 88% drop takes you all the way back to‚Ä¶.where Tesla‚Äôs shares began the year. 53/ 

A 90% decline takes the cap to $66B, 2.2x current run rate revenues & 37x a hypothetical 6% net margin. A mere 80% drop gets to a $132B cap, 4.4x revenues, and to give the bulls on Tesla not being a car company credit, still 37x a 12% hypothetical profit margin. Ridiculous. 54/ 

You can play around all you like w/ assumptions for growth, market share, expansion into new markets, profit & returns on capital, but paying for some fractional ownership of today‚Äôs $760B fully diluted market value is highly likely to produce a disastrous investment result. 55/ 

Bravo, S&P. The decision to add $TSLA at present valuation is almost sure to exact pain on passive investors, compelled to ‚Äúinvest‚Äù 1.75% of capital in one of the most overvalued companies on record. Brilliant. As the other Buffett sings, ‚ÄúCome Monday, it‚Äôll be all right...‚Äù 56/ 

As disclosure, I have a small short position in $TSLA. Don‚Äôt take this note as investment advice because it‚Äôs not. Do your own research. Stocks go up & down, and shorting is extremely dangerous. Upside is capped and downside is unlimited. $TSLA has risen 8.3x just this year. 57/ 

If Tesla repeats the same return over the next year the market cap would be $6.3 trillion. Two years of repeat performance and the cap becomes $52 trillion. Of course, that‚Äôs 70% larger than the entire S&P 500, but by then any short seller is long bankrupt. 58/58 END

TL;DR1: TSLA may go down, not probably but maybe at some point after SP500 inclusion. Why? It's mentioned somewhere in above points comparing it to some historical events and what TSLA makes!

TL;DR2 (from u/rch0wdhury): Yahoo failed after being added in S&P. Tesla can fail, or maybe not. We will get to know in future.",225,0.86

It‚Äôs nothing earth-shattering, but my sheer stupidity still bugs me.

Last year in mid-Sep I felt super smart buying 100 shares in TSLA at ~440$ and selling a deep out of the money call at my take profit target of 510$ for mid-Dec expiry, which gave me 3000$ (plus another 1000$ for selling a put for the same date also deep out of the money ~200$). 

Move ahead two months and it‚Äôs a late evening in mid-Nov: I am in Asia so live US trading is late nights. Had a great night ending up with my special Negronis that made me extra positive and (at least I thought) alert.

Before bed I checked the stock and at ~400$ I had lost around 4000$ on the stock, but the call had reduced enough in price to be nearly worthless, so I was willing to buy it back and sell a new call, ie neutralize my stock loss on the options, hold the TSLA stock position, and perhaps make some extra cash on selling farther out dated and money call.

So I log on my brokerage account, see TSLA, click close position, skim but don‚Äôt really read, and click submit... aaaand that‚Äôs when my stock position vanished.

I had closed the wrong position.ü§¶üèª Instead of taking profit on the shorted call, I had stoploss‚Äôed the stock position. Ie now I had not only realized 4000$ in losses on the stock, I was also sitting on an uncovered short call.

After this disaster, I called it a night and just left the call where it was, telling myself it‚Äôs not so risky since the stock will not reach 510$ in one month, so I could just let my shorted options expire for free.

Fast forward a month later: stock is indeed not at 510$, but instead at 700$! I scramble and barely manage to close my call at 16k loss on a dip on expiry day.

1. I took a -4000$ loss on equity position by mistake.
2. By mid-Dec that position would have been worth +16k and by now has doubled.
3. I did this instead of buying back my call at 3000$ realized profit
4. Instead I kept that cursed now uncovered short call, which ended up costing me another -16k to close eventually.

So a 2-3month play with 44k invested that would have yielded already +20k plus by mid-Dec turned into -20k loss (with fees). It looks even worse now, since I of course would have kept the stock position going and get a new long dated far out of the money short call. ü§¶üèª

The moral: don‚Äôt drink and trade (+my Negroni‚Äôs are awesome). Anyways, I‚Äôll use that excuse, but my smooth lazy ape brain likely would have done so anyhow.

With TSLA sitting at a 800 billion dollar market cap, you would need it to hit a 1.6 trillion market cap to make 100%.

&nbsp;

On 7 Jan 2020, Royal Bank of Canada admitted that ""There is no graceful way to put this other than to say we got TSLA's stock completely wrong"" and upgraded TSLA from $339 to $700. And on 6 Jan 2020, Morgan Stanley upgraded their TSLA price target to $810 when just 18 months ago they announced their comically low price target of $10 (that's $2 post split) resulting in a massive rally. Did  Morgan Stanley dive head first into WSB level 3 autism territory, or is there something that the uninitiated could be missing? Let's do a deep dive into Tesla the company and see if their stock really is in a bubble, or if there could be some substance behind the current insane rally.

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

The common FUD narrative among TSLAQ is that TSLA's $800+ billion market cap is now larger than the 10 largest auto manufacturers combined. (edit: Apparantly this is a common FUD talking point that is/was false. TSLA is/was nowhere near that level when it was touted around as so. Although it is undeniable that [Tesla's market cap became more and more absurd throughout 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/kts8ar/oc_tesla_is_not_bigger_than_the_next_10_biggest/)) 

&nbsp;

Indeed, this is quite insane. Even without us autists doing complex calculations, a simple google search shows that they would have to sell around [65 million vehicles a year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_manufacturers_by_motor_vehicle_production#2017) to be priced at that level. So how many vehicles did Tesla produce? Tesla announced on 2 January 2020 that they've sold a little shy of 500K vehicles for CY 2020 with plans to increase production by 50% YoY. This would ultimately bring them to 20 million vehicles produced by 2030. 

&nbsp;

20 mil by 2030. Although we all know the term ""Elon Time"", which refers to CEO Elon Musk casually announcing an estimate of a product and missing projected timelines by large margins, there seems to be some credibility to this statement. Back in 2014, Elon Musk [gave an interview (2:28)](https://youtu.be/arauCxOuDxU?t=148) where he stated ""I feel comfortable that we'll be able to achieve at least half a million cars a year by 2020"". 

&nbsp;

OK. So let's give him the benefit of the doubt. As a matter of fact, Tesla is actually building factories at breakneck speeds with construction literally running 24/7 and each of their large factories (Austin and Berlin) is said to be capable of producing up to 2 million vehicles a year. Giga Berlin which was an empty field 9 months ago is already [close to finishing its outer construction layer](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0173/8204/7844/articles/2_c51cdcab-d351-40f5-860f-1aa95dd1d3d7_1800x.jpg?v=1609802044). Obviously they plan to announce more factory constructions in the future as well. So they do seem to be on track to grow on average 50% YoY for now. But 20 million cars produced by 2030 is still massively shy of 65 million vehicles. Even with growth factored in, TSLA's stock valuation still seems insanely high. So what gives? The common explanation among the Tesla fanboys is that TSLA is a tech company, not an automotive company, so it should be valued just so. 

&nbsp;

So what is this mystical technology the fanboys speak of, and how is it being deployed in terms of profitability for Tesla? Well, it turns out that Tesla has three main technological advantages and two main revenue streams that might put them leaps and bounds ahead of competitors.

&nbsp;

1. **Autonomous Driving** - Tesla is the current market leader in vehicle autonomy. It has over [3 billion miles logged](https://lexfridman.com/tesla-autopilot-miles-and-vehicles/) as of April 2020. The next industry leader Waymo (owned by google) has approximately 20 million miles logged. One thing for sure is that no company will be able to catch Tesla in terms of pure data advantage within the next 4-5 years. And when it comes to Artificial Intelligence, data is king. This could be the bread and butter of Tesla. Tesla already charges customers $10k per vehicle to enable full self driving in which 25% of their customers choose the option. However, Tesla hasn't taken full profits on their books yet due to it still being in beta mode. Once they solve autonomy, an over-the-air (OTA) software update will be sent out just like how your iPhone updates and bam! now you have a self driving vehicle. Let's say Tesla charges $2k a year for a self driving vehicle that can also function as an autonomous uber driver which will help you pay down your vehicle or self driving subscription service. That's like selling two iPhone pros per every customer every year. And customers on their robotaxi network will also have to share 20% profits with Tesla. Think about this. The highest cost of ride hailing are for hourly wages. If no human is required to drive that vehicle, the cost of the ride hailing service will become insanely cheap. So cheap to the point that many people who live in cities will feel like they no longer need to own a vehicle and just call a robo taxi. People already do this in large cities! As this process accelerates, vehicles that don't have autonomy solved will lose market share dramatically every year. People who want cars will mainly want to buy a vehicle with an autonomous option, and people who don't care about owning a car will use robo taxis. If Tesla solves autonomy 4-5 years ahead of competitors, the entire auto industry will be disrupted by Tesla just like how the iPhone ended Blackberry and Nokia's dominance.

2. **Vehicle Manufacturing** - Tesla is an innovator when it comes to vehicle manufacturing technology, specifically robotics. Along with their insane factory automation process, they also have giga casters that mold car pieces quickly and efficiently that no other manufacturers have, and giant automated paint shops. This cuts down massively on labor and allows for quicker production while keeping margins high. Due to innovative technologies like these, it is estimated that Tesla's Shanghai Model 3 vehicles [net around 30% profit margins](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/13/teslas-shanghai-gigafactory-will-boost-margins-morgan-stanley.html), even after they've recently slashed their prices by 8%. Tesla recently slashed their [Model Y price by 30%](https://insideevs.com/news/463797/china-tesla-announced-new-prices-model-y-sales/) but still boast an [astonishing 29% profit margin](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-china-model-y-gross-margin-30-percent-report/) which is approximately 3 times the industry average. So even if robotaxi doesn't work out, they are still an industry leader by a large stretch in terms of profit margins. These margins will only increase after Giga Berlin is operational due to no longer having to ship vehicles across the Pacific to European customers.

3. **Vertical Integration** - Tesla is well known for its vertical integration. This is mainly due to having supply chain issues in the early days, but what this has enabled is agile production capability and larger profit margins. Due to this capability, Tesla improves components of their vehicles on the fly instead of the annual model release the traditional industry uses. Also, they don't have to share profits with suppliers or worry about constraints, delivery delays, or slow progress on contracts. 

4. **No Advertising & Dealerships** - Elon Musk is a walking billboard. The media literally gives Tesla free advertisement every day. As production increases, Tesla might have to start advertising in the future. But for now it seems like Teslas are selling themselves. Tesla has literally sold 100% of the vehicles they've ever produced, and they have never advertised any of their vehicles. Also, they do not have to share profits with dealerships with direct-to-consumer sales. If their market dominance and technology superiority continues, it is bound to stay the industry leader just like apple did with its iPhones. And if they solve autonomy first which they seem on track to do so, what's more to say?

5. **Regulatory Credits AKA Carbon Credits** - This is one that TSLAQs love to bring up when it comes to Tesla profits. You see, a handful of US States enacted a law that requires manufacturers to sell a certain percentage of [Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEV) in their state](https://www.currentautomotive.com/what-is-a-zev-credit-and-how-does-tesla-make-money-with-them/) which will earn them ZEV credits. If not, they will either have to pay a massive penalty fine, or buy ZEV credits from vehicle manufacturers who have plenty to spare. And Tesla has an overflow of ZEV credits laying around. So Tesla is literally getting paid by other vehicle manufacturers to build their vehicles. TSLAQs (incorrectly) state that the only reason Tesla makes a profit is because of regulatory credits. However, Tesla's [**ZEV credits only make up around 5% of their revenue (page 4, row 3)**](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/4E7BR9_TSLA_Q3_2020_Update_P0Q85U.pdf?xseo=&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q3-2020-Update.pdf%22) and it is slowly falling. No serious vehicle manufacturer will likely produce ICE vehicles in the year 2030 so ZEV credits fazing out is to be expected. Tesla vehicles are massively profitable as mentioned in bullet #2 even without the ZEV credits.

&nbsp;

So we went over the main revenue streams of Tesla. And if all works out well, it seems likely that Tesla has a good chance of 'winning' if they maintain their market leadership. However, the competition is coming, right? We have our favorite EV players such as Nio, XPeng, Li, Rivian, BYD etc. Also the traditional ICE manufacturers VolksWagen has their ID.4, Ford has thier Mustang Mach-E, Audi has thier etron, Porche has their Tycan, and GM has the Chevy Bolt and 30 EVs planned for the future. It seems inevitable that these industry giants with their massive resources will overtake Tesla. Or will they?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## **Why the Competition is NOT Coming (Tesla's Moats)**:

&nbsp;

1. **Difficulties of creating an EV vs. Mass Production**: Creating a shell of an EV or a prototype is extremely easy. If anything, Nikola has showed this to be true. Rivian seems to be having the same issue Tesla had when starting up where they had to constantly push back release dates due to how difficult it is to engineer and manufacture an EV. So designing a prototype is easy. Manufacturing an EV is another thing. But mass production is a whole different beast. It took Tesla well over 16 years to perfect their technology and mass produce their model 3 despite having the best engineers in the world working for them. Ever wonder why every single vehicle manufacturer has constantly been pushing back their EV production timelines? It's because EVs are difficult. Also to note is that no vehicle manufacturer other than Tesla has been able to achieve mass production in EVs. And until then, Tesla has no competition in the near horizon.

2. [**Supercharger network**](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErACHc5XUAA7RD-?format=jpg&name=medium): Tesla has the largest charging network in the world by orders of magnitude and they will continue to grow. VW is a low trailing second in the market due to penalties in their dieselgate scandel and as a lucky maneuver, [decided to build their electrify-america charging network](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/10/vws-2-billion-penalty-for-diesel-scam-builds-ev-charging-network-across-us.html). BTW, due to sunk costs, VW will likely be the only traditional ICE manufacturer that stands a chance of survival in the long run. Tesla owners barely get range anxiety like they used to back in the day. This is because it is easy to find a charging station even if they are going on a long trip with their map integration. However, you cannot say the same for the other EVs.

3. **Lidar vs. Camera**: Tesla's vehicles notoriously does not use lidar technology. Instead, they almost only rely on vision (cameras). There are three main reasons for this. (I.) Cameras are extremely cheap. Lidar is not. One of Waymo's vehicles are estimated to have [cost over $250k](https://qz.com/924212/what-it-really-costs-to-turn-a-car-into-a-self-driving-vehicle/) back in a 2017 estimate. Although in recent years Waymo seems to have developed lidar hardware that costs 90% less at $7.5k, it is still ridiculously expensive compared to cameras without adding much value. Here is Elon Musk's explanation, massively paraphrased: ""Cameras augmented with AI can do almost all the things that lidar does chiefly depth sensing. Human vision does not require a separate depth sensor, and the entire driving infrastructure is built with human vision in mind. Lidar is a fools errand."" Instead, Tesla augments its self driving technology with radar and maps. (II.) Lidar technology is usually augmented with something called HD maps. This is extreme detailed mapping (to the centimeter level) that helps lidar depth sensors with navigation. However, the issue with HD maps is that the file sizes are obviously large. And when detailed maps need to be updated due to construction or whatever which happens everywhere, every day, an OTA update needs to be sent out. And how do you update a fleet of all your vehicles when nationwide full coverage of 5G isn't a thing? So vehicles like Waymos are extremely good at driving within their geo-fenced locations, until they leave the area. And then they are absolute crap at it. OTOH, vision-based self driving vehicles are initially bad at the task until they have sufficient data and then they can drive well in almost every situation even without it being connected to the network. (III.) Vision-focused self driving AI can be augmented with additional sensors such as radar/lidar afterwards, but the inverse does not work. To put it short, if your lidar sensors disagree on the information they see at the moment, its entire system cannot function.

4. **Technological Dominance**: Tesla's vertical integration and engineering produced innovative solutions such as the [octovalve](https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/deep-looks-into-tesla-model-y-s-octovalve), [heat pump](https://www.currentautomotive.com/model-y-is-the-first-tesla-with-a-heat-pump-heres-why-thats-a-big-deal/), [leadership in battery and vehicle efficiency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK79ioBW8Mg), [custom designed AI chips](https://youtu.be/Ucp0TTmvqOE) and an AI supercomputer server ([Tesla Dojo](https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/tesla-supercomputer-dojo-v1-0-will-be-ready-in-about-1-year-says-elon-musk#:~:text=The%20Dojo%20is%20a%20Neural,during%20Autonomy%20Day%20in%202019.)) specifically made for autonomous driving advancement. No other company can come close to what Tesla is currently doing.

5. **Misdirected Competition**: Remember how we talked about ZEV credits? Well most ICE vehicle manufacturers only sell their vehicles in ZEV mandated states and nowhere else. [They literally lose money when they sell their vehicles](https://www.hotcars.com/gm-admits-bolt-not-profitable/#:~:text=A%202016%20report%20from%20Bloomberg,that%20left%20the%20dealer's%20lot.), or have to massively hike up their prices to make a profit even with tax credits, unlike Teslas. For this reason, they only make enough vehicles to make up for their ZEV credits. Naturally, one can assume the limits of effort gone into such vehicles. Now, let's talk about the EV start ups. I've already mentioned the massive growing pains they will have to reach mass production. However, the Chinese EV startups have one thing to their advantage - massive 5G infrastructure within China which will undoubtedly benefit automation, especially in the case of HD maps. However, this doesn't apply outside of China. To add to this, they do not produce in-house custom AI chipsets which is a [massive hinderance](https://equalocean.com/analysis/2020072714353) in processing data. Tesla did this with Nvidia for a while and ultimately decided that they had to design their own chips because of the lackluster performance.

6. **OTA Software Updates** - A minor point, but Tesla has been designing their own software for years now. Well known to the public, Teslas update very frequently and with each update gets slightly better UI and performance. Yes - a software update allows Teslas to get better efficiency out of their vehicles. One can argue that any auto manufacturer can implement OTA software updates, but Tesla is leagues ahead at the moment with top notch software developers.

7. **Talent Pool**: Guess what the [#1 company engineers want to work for](https://electrek.co/2020/11/11/tesla-most-attractive-company-engineering-students-massive-advantage/) is? That's right. Tesla. #2 is SpaceX. Try all they want, but the best engineers aren't going to want to work with Ford or GM.

8. **""The Competition""**: I already mentioned the half-assedness of traditional ICE vehicle manufacturers but I wanted to bring up another point. One thing that traditional ICE manufacturers have weighing them down are their employees. Their ICE engineers don't translate well into a totally different EV drivetrain. There are sunk costs (equipment etc) that deal with ICE manufacturing processes. Also, Ford, GM, and VW all have unions, pension funds, and stockholders. What do you think their reaction will be when they decide to ditch the currently-profitable-but-soon-to-be-shrinking ICE vehicle component and transition into resource intensive EVs? That's right. They won't like it. The only solution is to half-ass it and slowly transition into EVs while trying to keep afloat their ICE vehicle component. With massive product line diversification and lack of focus, this is not going to be an easy transition. VW CEO Herbert Diess famously stated that ""*My goal for the future is clear: leading the Group into a sustainable and successful future. The global transformation in the industry will take roughly ten years, with or without Volkswagen*."" and tried to convince board members basically stating that [**VW will need to transition into EVs within 10 years or go bankrupt**](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-we-transform-volkswagen-herbert-diess). Ultimately, Diess wasn't successful in achieving full cooperation of the board and had to compromise in his goals to a more gradual transition. The competition is NOT coming. Oh, and as for Waymo and Uber? Well Uber recently sold off their self-driving startup, and Waymo [sunk a jaw dropping $3.5 billion](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a30857661/autonomous-car-self-driving-research-expensive/) for their operation. LOL. They are paying drivers to monitor their expensive ""autonomous vehicles"" while Tesla gets this done while making a profit. As of 2020, Waymo still [only has 600 vehicles](https://www.ft.com/content/6b1b11ea-b50b-4dd5-802d-475c9731e89a) and has never left the bounds of Pheonix, AZ. 

&nbsp;

OK. So I'm sure I've missed some points but I think this paints a decent picture on why Tesla is considered the one and only market leader at the moment. Now let's go into...

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

## **Tesla's Disruptive Potentials**:

&nbsp;

1. **The $25,000 EV**: In Tesla's battery day announcement, Tesla projected that their battery technology will enable them to build a $25k vehicle in the future. According to [projections using Wright's law](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/wrights-law-predicts-teslas-gross-margin/), this seems to be plausible. Most think this will happen around 2023-4. Think of the disruption this will bring. EVs are well known for having lower maintenance cost vs. ICE vehicles due to not having as many moving parts. The true cost of ownership for a $25k vehicle will be vastly superior to a $20k ICE vehicle. Once this happens, **ICE vehicle demand will fall through the roof**. The only ICE vehicles being sold at high volume will be used vehicles. What happens to the traditional ICE manufacturers then? Tesla vehicles are already [perceived to hold their value much better than other brands](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a33935142/tesla-model-3-depreciate-electric-car/) because of the overall feature it comes with. 

2. **Tesla Auto Insurance**: Tesla collects massive amounts of data. They can easily profile their customers' driving patterns, check if they have self driving enabled, the route they drive etc. Currently Tesla vehicles are insured at a much higher premium vs. economic ICE vehicles. Once Tesla goes fully into the insurance business, traditional insurance companies will not be able to compete with them on price or margins. This is because the insurance business is based upon data on the customer and projections.

3. **Solar City** - Tesla's other business deals with solar panels, Tesla power walls, and their Autobidder software which sells the electricity that you generated back to the grid. Tesla currently offers the lowest solar panel price in the U.S. and moreover, takes 20% of the revenue generated from their autobidder software. Renewable energy is poised to grow. More than 50% annually is the current projection. And Tesla seems to be one of the industry leaders in this market as well.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## **Risks**: 

1. **Failing autonomous driving**: definitely a major risk as the current stock price is largely betting on this single technology to materialize. However, [their current progress and the rate of improvement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHe4hFvgDc) after rewriting their autopilot code seems promising.

2. **Failing mass battery production (battery supply issues)**: Although Tesla is the largest producer of batteries in the world, they will need to produce more if they want to keep up with the current pace of expansion. This will be a major bottleneck for Tesla if they cannot solve this issue. As a solution, Tesla has reduced their reliance on copper and are said to be producing batteries with little to no copper. We shall see how this pans out.

3. **Tesla is infamous for its poor Quality Control** on their vehicles and **slow/poor Customer Service**. We shall see if time solves this issue.

4. **Lack of Tax Incentives**: Tesla's vehicles no longer provide Federal tax incentives to U.S. customers. However, they seem to be doing fine with over 80% EV marketshare in the U.S. alone. They're [stealing market share from BMW, VW, Acura](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/01/11/bmw-usa-sales-2014-2019-getting-slammed-by-tesla-or-not/)... you name it.

5. **Elon Musk Death**: Elon Musk has been able to achieve amazing engineering feats. If he dies, I'm sure a lot of the company's potential will go with it.

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

## **Alternative Battery Technology**: 

&nbsp;

1. **Solid State Battery** - Quantumscape which is currently the leader in this sector has plans to enter mass production by 2024. We shall see if their battery technology turns out to be as efficient as Tesla's. If QS's SS batteries turn out to be superior to Tesla's, they might have to start purchasing from them.

2. **Hydrogen Fuel Cell (HFC) Battery** - Likely not a good use for vehicles. [Very low efficiency and wasteful](https://insideevs.com/news/406676/battery-electric-hydrogen-fuel-cell-efficiency-comparison/#:~:text=Depending%20on%20the%20model%2C%20the,is%20from%2025%2D35%25.) vs lithium-ion batteries. Currently no infrastructure for HFC in place. Might be useful for freight shipping. Elon Musk famously stated that HFC's are ""Fool Cells""

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## **Tesla Future Products Lines**: 

1. **Cybertruck**: Insane profit margins, amazing performance. estimated production end of 2021 or 2022

2. **Semi Truck**: estimated production 2022 or later

3. **Model S Refresh**: Insane specs. Likely release is 2021

4. **2020 Roadster**: Insane specs but surprise! The ""2020 Roadster"" renewal never happened and most are projecting 2022 or later

5. **$25k EV**: 'nuff said

&nbsp;

---

## **TSLA Analysis**: 

&nbsp;

TSLA Institutional Ownership: 62.85%

TSLA Insider Ownership: 5.21%

TSLA Fanboy Ownership: estimated 5%+

So there is a stable 70%+ of ownership that will not/cannot sell this stock, unlike PLTR which has only 12% institutional ownership and 63% insider ownership. This is the reason why I think the stock won't drop tremendously even when it tanks. There are plenty of people who are willing to snatch up more shares at a discount.

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

**Why did TSLA shoot up so quickly in 2020**: This is my personal opinion, but TSLA fans are known for doing deep research into the company. In the early days this was in forums such as the [Tesla Motors Club](https://teslamotorsclub.com/) where they shared their own research on revenue, projections, and potentials. Now we have YouTube and information dissemination has gotten easier. Interest in investing has skyrocketed in 2020. Stock market trading GLOBALLY has gotten easier via smartphone with apps such as Robinhood and the prosperity of the American stock market has no doubt attracted global retail investors. For years, Tesla's stock has been pushed down by FUD analysts. Paid by big oil and traditional ICE manufacturers? Or really that dumb not to do any DD and spread completely false information on a company that you are massively shorting. We might never find out. Retailers have caught onto Tesla's potential ahead of analysts this time. And as in Morgan Stanley and RBC's case, analysts have just been catching up on the future potential of Tesla to not make a further fool of themselves.

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

**Future scenarios and Personal Opinion**: Currently, Tesla holds over 18% of the global EV marketshare. As more EV players come into space, it might seem like Tesla is in danger of losing marketshare. Not everyone wants a Tesla and that is understandable. But as the overall pie is growing, Tesla, with their 50% YoY production increase plans (which is exponential growth), will likely remain a market leader sustaining their current 18% market share even in 2030 just like how the iPhone did. This is, of course, if they can keep up their growth.

&nbsp;

Even if TSLA fails to develop their robo-taxi network technology, their full self driving subscription seems highly likely to materialize at the current pace albeit a lower revenue model. 

&nbsp;

Ultimately, do I think the current stock price is a bubble? Fuck yes I do, maybe by up to 20%. I'm not buying any more TSLA shares anywhere near this price. My FOMO was back when the stock price was $415 after doing my DD and this was with the intention to buy more shares even if the stock bottomed out. Well, it never bottomed because the S&P inclusion was announced shortly after I purchased it. 

&nbsp;

But if you ask my personal opinion, you gotta be a ""buy high sell low"" type top level autist if you're looking for short term gains and purchasing at this level. I'm looking at long term, slow moving, dead ass boring, Bitcoin HODLing, Warren Buffet style ""time in market beats timing the market"" boomer gains here. My next purchase will be whenever the stock price, if ever, bottoms out. However, just because I think TSLA is overpriced doesn't mean that I'm shorting this stock either. 

&nbsp;

Amazon was notoriously non-profitable or barely profitable until 2015 because they were reinvesting their profits into expansion. That is what Tesla is doing right now. Remember all the analysts who continuously warned investors for over a decade to stay away from AMZN because they are unprofitable? Well, I don't see any sane analysts parroting that narrative anymore. And then its stock price shot to the moon after they enabled profit mode. It's stock price nearly doubled due to the pandemic and I'm still not planning on shorting this stock even though the pandemic will likely go away in less than a year. 

&nbsp;

I don't know how TSLA will do in the short term. Nonetheless, I do believe that Tesla has the best chance among any auto maker out there to reach a $2-10+ trillion valuation within 10 years. So I'm just going to lean back and enjoy the show.

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

**TL;DR**: Tesla HAS NO COMPETITION. This is as if android wasn't developed until 4 years after the iPhone was released. Do NOT short or buy puts on TSLA. Although the current run seems absolutely insane, there is some substance to hold it up and possibly keep shooting up higher

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

**Positions**: TSLA shares @ $415 and a bunch more with an average price of $518. No calls because my wife's boyfriend did not permit.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## **Back of the Napkin Calculations**

**Warning**: These are literally back of the napkin, pure crack fantasy calculations based on four factors:

1. Tesla will be able to increase production by 50% YoY until 2030 without fall in demand or issues scaling. As a side note, Toyota sells 10.5 million vehicles in a year so only time will tell if Tesla is able to sell 20 million vehicles a year.

2. ZEV credits will gradually diminish due to manufacturers switching to EVs.

3. Tesla will solve level 3 autonomy by 2022 and will charge customers $1k/yr. Tesla will have level 5 autonomy by 2026 and launch its robotaxi network by 2027 which it will then charge customers $2k/yr. 

4. The robotaxi revenue is from the 20% profit sharing Tesla plans to do, but as far as the numbers go, I straight up pulled it out of my ass while referencing Uber's revenue and fudging numbers.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

As you can see, I omitted R&D expenses, operating expenses etc., and haven't even attempted to calculate their net profit or factor in that Tesla's revenue might drop due to introducing cheaper variants. But this back of the napkin, crack infused revenue model shows that Tesla's potential can be gigantic. This is even without its other businesses like Solar City or Tesla insurance etc. Please... don't reference this anywhere because it is dumb math and I likely made some huge errors lol.

This has to be one of the best videos they have ever put out. I have never seen a video where someone so condescendingly tries to prove the guest wrong and it turns out the guest is 100% right. Just goes to show the arrogance on wall street and how stupid some of these fund managers truly are.

2021-01-25 04:56:34,Stock Market News for Today | PLTR / GM / AAPL / TSLA / FB / MSFT & Other Stock Market News [01-25],"**Stocks close out the week with big gains, as Big Tech comes back in flavor. The earnings frenzy starts with Apple, Tesla, Facebook & Microsoft reporting. GameStop, GM & Ford spiked last week, let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of Friday as we saw most of the stock market giving up some of the big gains of the week, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/ZxdGSkm) losing .30% & the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/MRn5Q40) Industrial dropping 179 points while the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/F3wm2d8) barely managed to post a small gain for the day as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/JRkwsZn) ticking up a little but finishing under 22 for the week, with the Nasdaq gaining 4.2% in the short week the SP500 rising 1.9% and the Dow Jones posting a .6% gain.

About 55% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/hFF1hSm) were advancing on below average volume as the number of companies moving above the moving averages still remains very high. We only saw 3 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/pPJpQCk) posting small gains for the day while the biggest losers were the value play in Financials, Energy and Industrials, all losing more than .50%

For the week we saw communications outperform with a big spike after Netflix reported earnings, while Energy had more than one ugly day dropping big on Monday, Thursday and Friday.

Small-caps faired better to close out the [week](https://ibb.co/y0C39gJ), with all 3 groups posting gains of more than 1.5% while Large-Cap Value companies underperformed losing more than 2.5% for the week, as Growth Companies & Especially the big-caps finally outperformed this week, gaining 2.3%.

Here is the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/MnWSRV4), which was a pretty mixed bag, with Apple posting a big gain ahead of the earnings report while the other big tech companies also posted small-gains. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/BfYRHWS) though, we saw huge gains in most of the big tech names with all the FAANG names and Microsoft gaining more than 5% for the week, while Banks alongside Oil & Gas companies were the biggest losers

We also got some economic data on Friday as existing home [sales](https://ibb.co/KWxRW9m) rose again while the inventory is still at all time-lows of under 2 months of supply while the January [PMI](https://ibb.co/x54dqCy) current read came in at 58, way above the 55.5 expected and 55.3 in the previous read as both the Services and Manufacturing PMI saw a spike of more than 2 points

This week we also start the [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/2nsRvBx) frenzy, with AMD which might benefit from Intel‚Äôs drop last week, Microsoft & Starbucks reporting after Tuesday‚Äôs close as JNJ might also give some updates regarding their vaccine, while big value companies like Boeing, AT&T & Caterpillar report before the open on Wednesday & Friday. We also have some of the big tech names reporting on the same day, with Apple which is expected to have their first $100B quarter, Tesla & Facebook reporting after Wednesday‚Äôs close which might be a bigger volatility moment for the market depending on how the results come in.

In terms of economic [data](https://ibb.co/Fx6TWyw), we start off [today](https://ibb.co/4K4DDvp) with the Dallas FED Manufacturing survey but the most interesting ones are on Thursday & Friday, while we also wait to see what the FED announces in terms keeping the rates low & the money printer going with asset buying on Wednesday.

In some other stock market, we saw [Palantir](https://ibb.co/zV2vxft) soar on Friday, rising more than 25% to break the $30 levels after they updated their Demo Day scheduled for tomorrow. It‚Äôs expected that they will reveal the latest developments in their big software platforms and also reveal [new](https://ibb.co/swYH61R) software platforms that will continue to help the company grow such as SDDI, Low-Code/No-Code and other modular strategy software.

We also saw [Ford](https://ibb.co/D8cmmZn) soaring again, as the company is having the best monthly performance in more than 10 years and spiked more than 6% after JP Morgan upgraded the company based on their new product line which is what I‚Äôve been saying about the company in some months now. Tesla is going to face serious competition in the next decade with all the other car manufactures pushing harder and harder into the EV world, with some of the most popular cars out there like the F150, the Bronco and other models joining the sector that will continue to improve and might actually become a good alternative to Tesla‚Äôs models. It‚Äôs the same with others like [GM](https://ibb.co/42G3ttK) which might be a good catch-up play compared to Tesla. By the way‚Ä¶ [GM](https://ibb.co/vPwbPCs) is outperforming Tesla recently based on their developments in the EV & self-driving sector.

Meanwhile, [GME](https://ibb.co/bXYsj4k) had a wild day on Friday, gaining more than 50% despite being even higher as the battle between WSB & the shorts continues, with this move making Citron‚Äôs Left deciding to avoid further talks about the company probably in an attempt to avoid future attention at the GameStop short squeeze. Short Squeeze has seen a big rise in terms of [search](https://ibb.co/qn51BPH) interest after these latest moves in the GameStop stock and might even put more pressure on the bears, as retail investors might run up this stock even more.

So, guys, this week might bring a lot of volatility depending on many of the important events we have. Earnings seasons & especially big tech results will be important to justify these high multiples most of the tech names have received, while we also have to see how the GDP comes in, as it is expected to have seen a 4% growth for the 4th quarter while the FED is under pressure to keep the money printer on and the rates low, if not, or if there is any doubt in their commitments and also some numbers come in worse than expected we might see the long-awaited correction/pullback. But I don‚Äôt think numbers or the FED are going to disappoint really, but that doesn‚Äôt exclude the possibility of the pullback‚Ä¶ keep investing safely & have some money available to buy the dips if they appear, use them as a buying opportunity, not a panic sell.

So, let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/929L2rz) are pointing to a very good open, with the Nasdaq leading the way up almost 1%

2021-01-03 13:01:34,"Ten(die) Traits of the TENBAGGER ($PLTR, $RKT, $TSLA)"," Fellow smooth brains, broke boiz, and gainz girls,

I've had a lot of down time this week since I'm cooped up in q-tine with the vid. Figured I'd change it up and spend time to listen and read about people who actually made money in the markets, instead of edging to EOY loss porn for 10 days straight.

I found a few different hedge fund daddies to keep me company during the alt reality of rona isolation. These dudes weren't smooth brain; they read books and wrote them too. They made all their tendies in the pre-dawn era before the internet, but a lot of their concepts are the foundations of today's DD flair.

One of these hedge fund daddies is Peter Lynch; the silver fox averaged 30% returns over 13 years as manager of Fidelity's Magellan Fund. He frequently & routinely states ""Stonks only go up"" and ""Buy the FKN DIP"" in pre-internet era interviews and he's got a rager for the market advantages of individuals (retail, us, idiots) vs. wall street (chads, citron, warren buffet). He actually walked away from Wall Street at relatively young age to spend more time with his family. This decision can only be interpreted one way; he made enough tendies to send his wife's boyfriend back to instructing $PTON classes and preying on other men's wives. For this, the legacy of he Silver Fox must be immortalized - he is legend.

Anyway, Lynch is pretty famous for coining the characteristics (traits) of a ten bagger. Since I've got lots of time and there's no loss porn on the weekends, I thought it would be an interesting idea to back test some of these ideas on WSB favorites & active bag holders like $RKT, $PLTR, and $TSLA.

**10 Traits of a Ten Bagger:**

**1. Name is Dull or Ridiculous: All tickers check.**

¬∑ Red $RKT? Sheesh dude calm down.

¬∑ $PLTR? Fool of a took!

¬∑ $TSLA? That socialist electrician?

**2. It does something dull: All tickers check.**

¬∑ $RKT: Mortgage loan processing.

¬∑ $PLTR: Data aggregation & integration. wut?

¬∑ $TSLA: Sells cars.

**3. It Does something disagreeable: All tickers check.**

¬∑ $RKT: Online loan processing is perceived as untrustworthy by institutions & individuals.

¬∑ $PLTR: Blah blah blah oppression, NSA & data privacy

¬∑ $TSLA: ""There will never be a market for EVs!""

**4. Institutions don't own & analysts don't follow: Only $PLTR checks.**

¬∑ $RKT: 15 analysts have coverage with an avg. PT of $24.7

¬∑ $PLTR: 7 analysts have coverage with an avg. PT of $15

¬∑ $TSLA: Everyone talkin' TSLA these days. Irrelevant.

**5. It's depressing: All 3 tickers check with some massaging of the interpretation.**

¬∑ $RKT: When I grew up, home loan refinancing was a bad thing borne from necessity. Exchanging equity for better loan terms prolongs payments and adds long-term interest. These improve affordability and increase in popularity with each recession.

¬∑ $PLTR: Literally sells system solutions for crisis situations. Think COVID/Conflict/Fraud.

¬∑ $TSLA: The narrative sells because the climate crisis is the defining issue of our age.

**6. The industry isn't growing: All 3 check with some massaging of the interpretation.**

¬∑ $RKT: Growth is not the same as appreciation. The housing market continues to spike in part because of archaic housing & city planning policies that prevent new supply from entering markets.

¬∑ $PLTR: New data points & software solutions continue to be introduced & sold, but PLTR is unique in it's integration & aggregation capabilities. Nobody else is selling this particular solution; in fact, PLTR views their biggest competition as a companies' desire to internalize this solution.

¬∑ $TSLA: EVs sales are in fact growing exponentially, however the sales are pulling demand from the existing market share of the automobile industry, not creating new market share. Additionally, modern transportation policy ***likely*** reduces the amount of new cars on the road as EVs are increasingly exposed as an edge case for addressing climate change. Also, ARK (momma Wood) has done a bunch of research re: the pending used-car bubble that will put further ownership equity pressure on loans, dealers, and individuals still buying used ICE cars. The combined pressures of costs associated with personal vehicle ownership, rapid asset depreciation, autonomous ride hailing, modern transpo plans focused on decreased congestion & emissions, will significantly reduce the size of this industry in the near/mid term future.

o P.S. I <3 Pete Bootycheeks, US Transpo Sec. Build all the rails & bike lanes.

**7. It's got a NICHE: All 3 check.**

¬∑ $RKT: mobile loan processing. Speed speed speed. Ease ease ease. Cheese cheese cheese. $RKT's solutions saves time, better prepare buyers & refinancers, simplifies the process, and reduces monthly expense. Rock solid like my $RKT in the mornings.

¬∑ $PLTR: how many of you work at a fortune 500 (not Wendy‚Äôs) that requires you to query data for routine reports? How many logins do you have? how many systems do you need to navigate? Do you know how your co addresses this? They pay managers who can't write =sumif() excel functions, to piece together PowerPoints and workflow diagrams that communicate system enhancements to $100k+ soft devs and system architects who then Frankenstein together 10+ paid SAAS ""solutions"" in 1-3 years. $PLTR comes in hot and ready like the domineos pizza pie delivery guy ready to feed & seed the shmeat lovers. $PLTR works with what you got, growers and showers, to create a highly scalable 2 way data integration & aggregation system in hours.

¬∑ $TSLA: Battery & self driving tech are the biggest niches at this point, but don't sleep on those EV credits. Wall street industry idiots are salty that $TSLA can improve margins by selling polluter permission slips to allow polluters to pollute, but co's love to pollute so those things print.

**8. Recurring Revenues: All 3 check.**

¬∑ $RKT: Definition of ""Recurring"": ""occurring again periodically or repeatedly."" $RKT reports a lot of money each quarter's earnings reports. Don't @ me.

¬∑ $PLTR: the business model is designed to scale billing in tandem with gains made from solution utility.

¬∑ $TSLA: At this stage, car sales are growing and we haven't hit an extended downturn in the cyclical environment. Just wait till the FSD, energy credits, insurance, ride hailing, and grid energy revenues print infinitely and indefinitely. Anticipate unrealized earnings & receivables to pace with earnings growth.

**-(9. Insiders are buying: $RKT & $TSLA check.**

¬∑ $RKT: Daddy Dan Gilbert & Juicy Jay Farner were loading up on shares < $20 in August

¬∑ $PLTR: Mithril (a Papa Thiel fund) got clearance to buy an s-ton of $PLTR at some point last week. Basically, a buy back, but we'll see more when the lock-up period ends.

¬∑ $TSLA: Denholym sold 43k shares at \~$400 per, but Emperor Elon is diamond handing his market cap option tranches which counts IMO.

**-(10. Its buying back shares: $RKT & $PLTR check.**

¬∑ $RKT: Announced a completed $1B buyback on the last earnings call

¬∑ $PLTR: Momma Wood (ARK) has been adding $1m+ in shares each week, but it basically just went public so too early for this.

¬∑ $TSLA: Issuing new funds to improve cash positions at elevated market cap.

Positions:

Buy the dip, LONG $RKT & $PLTR until $75b market cap, then readjust thesis. $TSLA to $1T market cap, then pivot into 2% divvie stocks till' I transcend into a Silver Fox incarnate.

2021-01-19 07:09:27,$TSLA Prediction for End of 2021.,"**EDIT: Prediction for End of January 2021.**

Here‚Äôs my slightly bold predictions in anticipation of Tesla‚Äôs Q4 Earnings Call on 1/27.

On market close of 1/15 $826.16 per share, marking a 6.5% decline in value from TSLA‚Äôs all time high of $880.02 just two weeks prior. As TSLA‚Äôs history has proven time and time again, these temporary reductions in price represent a perfect time to invest, as TSLA shares tend to climb in a roaring fashion following short bursts of decline.

[TSLA 1\/19\/2021 Immediately Prior to Post Submission.](https://preview.redd.it/nrhqdjrg1bc61.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc8fb13d1e6466bb746b64d36f7a90b3141b032b)

This is not to mention Tesla‚Äôs record-breaking numbers that will be announced on the earnings call 1/27. I predict by the month‚Äôs end, TSLA shares surpass and create a new all time high, possibly greater than $900/share.

This is definitely extremely bullish, however here are the key components that make up this prediction.

&#x200B;

1. Tesla‚Äôs Q4 earnings call will announce record-breaking free cash flow, revenue, deliveries, and gross profit. Actualizing these numbers to investors will drive shares up.
2. Many casual investors and bystanders underestimate the profit margins of the new Model Y. Retailing for $4,000 more than the Model 3, Tesla has previously shared that the cost of manufacturing a Model Y is less than a Model 3 due to improving technology in the manufacturing process. Not to mention Tesla‚Äôs Q4 press release did not include the rumored 100k MYs sold in under 10 hours in China as a result of the lower than expected retail. All in all, Tesla will have delivered excess of 500k vehicles and a net profit higher than expected.

3. 2021 Guidance. It is understandable that many Tesla investors are eagerly awaiting Tesla's projections for 2021 deliveries. The current ""expert"" consensus is \~771k deliveries, whereas I predict Tesla's 2021 guidance for deliveries to be around 850k. However, I bet internal goals will be closer to 1M vehicles delivered, as both gigafactory Berlin and Austin are slated to begin producing vehicles mid-2021. If the 850k guidance is correct and reached at the end of 2021, that will mark a 70% expansion in deliveries from 2020, putting Tesla on pace for another record year in sales & deliveries.

4. Expect Tesla to unveil additional details to current and future projects during the Q4 earnings call. Projects that could be mentioned include: Tesla Roadster, Tesla \~$25k car, Cybertruck, Semitruck, and New Gigafactory.

It will hit over 900 and likely over $1000 this week, and what's worse for those who didn't hold your calls is that if they expire this week those gains will be 10x more than normal, you just lost out on the key to the safe to take $10 and buy Burger King instead.

Now that we have the pleasantries out the way; what you ppl do not understand is that the recent continuation of $TSLA's mooning has nothing to do with its technical analysis or news cycle. The $TSLA diamond handers and FOMO boomers have driven the price up so hard since inclusion to the $SPY that benchmark funds and even some major funds have yet to balance their ports and are still in process of doing so.

Im not gonna act like Im a fkn ETF's and index savant so correct my retard interpretation if I'm wrong but from what I do know--is that $TSLA is going up so hard that its already weighted at 2% in $SPY. Thus, if these benchmark funds aren't in $TSLA or properly balanced w/ $TSLA then you're essentially short $TSLA. Thus, price will continue to rise till equilibrium is achieved in the funds--allegedly. For the 5 of you that can read, the source is a twitter thread discussing these topics.

So will $TSLA have a doomsday drop as you paper-handed bitches claim? Maybe. But that can be attributed to almost any stock that meme'd in 2020. The take-away is that $TSLA is still serving tendies, and I'm definitely still in that mufuckin' line. I couldn't give a fuck about the constant fluidity of the inner workings of corporations and ETFs and shit, so if any of you autist boomers can add any insight if you aren't sleep already at 11pm on a Saturday night, go ahead.

And how the next day it went up almost 12% to $630? They're DESPERATE trying to bring the stock price down. Tesla knows that it will be hard to capture new talent if their stock trades at their 2025 earnings... that means no returns for those engineers if the stock goes down from here or trades sideways.

But see how hard it was to keep the stock under $600? Well there are a bunch of traders and fund managers that know that $600 is an important level of support and that keeping the stock down would lead to a chain selling reaction... they can't afford that. So they've been doing their best efforts to keep the stock below $650 and above $600.

**There are three forces at play here:** momentum hedge fund managers that bought shares in November and have been selling this week to secure profits; Tesla which tried to hit the stock hard selling 5 BILLION dollars in shares in ONE DAY (who does that if you want to keep the stock up?); and WEALTHY TRADERS that don't wanna be bag holders and are waiting for FRIDAY to send this stock to the moon.

All traders until now have been bag holders and funds. These traders will try to push the stock on Friday as far up as they can, I can see it going to $700 premarket and get a 20% day after that. **THE REAL WAR BEGINS NOW.**

I'm all in on this. It will be insane but we must fight like Spartans and I wanted to post this to give some perspective, because some of you might've felt discouraged by the couple last red days. But I think we can win this.

EDIT:

Many champs saying that these funds have been buying up until now and will exchange the shares on addition date. First, there are trading funds that wanted to capitalize momentum but here we're talking the index tracking funds, these index funds don't wanna beat the index they must and want to imitate it, so they will try to add TSLA at as close of a price as possible to official closing price on Friday 12/18. Second, it is ILLEGAL as per SEC regulations to cross sell shares between funds even if the funds are own by the same company (E.g. Vanguard), SHARES MUST PASS THROUGH MARKET. That's why when Ark invest shows that they sold Tesla shares they show the shares sold per fund, or if one fund buys and the other sells they show in the trading report because the shares must pass through market, they can't simply move them from one fund to the other.

***TLDR:*** **$**TSLA is likely partnering with $VALE to produce the insane quantity of Nickel needed to make Tesla‚Äôs vehicles, this is almost certainly happening for the following reasons‚Ä¶

***READ FULL BEST DD ON WSB***

* $VALE is the largest nickel producer in the entire world, with Tesla constantly calling for more Nickel production the partnership potential for these two companies is a match made in heaven.
* $VALE notified creditors on September 14th that it was paying off it‚Äôs $5 billion debt, suggesting a large deal leveling them an insane amount of capital.
* $VALE‚Äôs trading volume is up 37% from it‚Äôs average and has bullish whale activity in the options chain.
* Earlier this month, $VALE announced that they would be paying an extra dividend, on top of their regularly scheduled dividend, reinforcing the thesis of a strong balance sheet
* Tesla and $VALE already have a history of being bidirectional business partners for over a year.
* Conservative estimates reveal Tesla's growth plan leaves $VALE‚Äôs competitors ill equipped to deal with the demand for nickel Tesla needs to produce it's vehicles within five years.

**>>>TESLA NEEDS NICKEL<<<**

If there is one to take away from this post, it is the fact that Tesla vehicles need nickel and insane quantities of it. No one is better equipped to supply nickel to Tesla than $VALE. During Tesla‚Äôs Q2 earnings call, Elon [painstakingly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lvmOJGC_es&amp;t=37m39s) laid out how badly they were looking for a nickel producer.

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôd just like to re-emphasize, any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel. Okay. Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel and don‚Äôt wait for nickel to go back to some long ‚Äî some high point that you experienced some five years ago, whatever. Go for efficiency, obviously environmentally-friendly nickel mining at high volume. Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time, if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally-sensitive way. So hopefully this message goes out to all mining companies. Please get nickel.‚Äù

**>>>THE STARS ALIGNED<<<**

The following points are largely circumstantial evidence, however when stacked together create an extremely powerful narrative and points toward the extreme likelihood of $VALE actually having lined up a *revolutionary* deal with Tesla.

**Quotes from Tesla Q2 2020 Earnings Call**

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so much to be excited about. It‚Äôs really hard to kind of fit into this call, but the sheer amount of hardcore engineering, especially on the autonomy and the manufacturing/engineering front is mind-blowing. And then of course there‚Äôs Battery Day, which is coming up pretty soon. And I think that‚Äôs really going to surprise people by just how much there is to see.‚Äù-Elon Musk

‚ÄúYeah. The real limitation on Tesla growth is cell production at affordable price. That‚Äôs the real limit. So that‚Äôs where ‚Äî we‚Äôre going to talk about ‚Äî a lot more about this on Battery Day because this is a fundamental scaling constraint. And any part of that supply chain or processing at the cell level will be a limiting factor. So whatever it may be, anywhere from mining to refining ‚Äî there‚Äôs many steps from refining to cathode and anode, cell formation. Whatever the choke point is, that will set the growth rate. And so we expect to expand our business with Panasonic, with CATL, with LG, possibly with others, and there‚Äôs a lot more to say on that front on Battery Day.‚Äù-Elon Musk

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôd just like to re-emphasize, any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel. Okay. Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel and don‚Äôt wait for nickel to go back to some long ‚Äî some high point that you experienced some five years ago, whatever. Go for efficiency, obviously environmentally-friendly nickel mining at high volume. [Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lvmOJGC_es&amp;t=37m39s), if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally-sensitive way. So hopefully this message goes out to all mining companies. Please get nickel.‚Äù-Elon Musk

‚ÄúLike the thing that bugs me the most about where we are right now is that our cars are not affordable enough. We need to fix that. So we‚Äôre all making progress in that regard, just sort of steadily gaining progress. So yeah, we need to not go bankrupt, obviously. That‚Äôs important, because then we‚Äôll fail in our mission. But we‚Äôre not trying to be super profitable either, obviously, profitability is like 1% or something, just 1% or 2%. It‚Äôs not crazy. Last quarter, it was only like 0.1%. So we want to be profitable. Like I think just we want to be like slightly profitable and maximize growth, and make the cars as affordable as possible, and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre trying to achieve.‚Äù-Elon Musk

‚ÄúYes, good afternoon. Thank you. You mentioned a few times about the constraint to growth is battery capacity still. And I was hoping you could clarify the scope of the Berlin plant you‚Äôre building right now. Will there be ‚Äî the battery capacity consistent with the amount of assembly volume you expect to come out of Berlin? And if not, will you be able to source your battery requirements out of Europe? Will you have to import batteries from outside Europe to ensure production in Berlin?

[According To Tesla CEO Elon Musk, This Metal is The New Gold](https://insideevs.com/news/440582/elon-musk-lithium-ion-battery-nickel-is-new-gold/)

The demand and future of nickel will continue to grow for the foreseeable future. Electric vehicles and other modern technology NEED nickel to function.

‚ÄúWith demand expected to increase from 2.2 million metric tons to somewhere in the range of 3.5 million to 4.0 million metric tons by 2030, the nickel market could become constrained.‚Äù-McKinsey and Company By Marcelo Azevedo, Nicolas Goffaux, and Ken Hoffman

**Elon Musk‚Äôs Emphasis on ‚ÄúEnvironmentally Friendly‚Äù**

During the call and clip that was hyperlinked above, Elon emphasizes the demand for an ‚Äúenvironmentally friendly‚Äù mine. Historically, we all know mines have run into trouble with being friendly toward the environment. Today more than ever, a company's concern for the environment must be vocally expressed and physically acknowledged. If not, the reporters and media will bash Tesla for not being environmentally sensitive. Elon Musk understands this and is aware that the nickel company Tesla chooses must at least appear as if they are environmentally ‚Äúsensitive"". Vale‚Äôs website has information on how they are [sustainable](http://www.vale.com/EN/investors/information-market/annual-reports/sustainability-reports/Sustainability%20Reports/Relatorio_sustentabilidade_vale_2019_alta_en.pdf) and [conscious](http://www.vale.com/esg/en/Pages/Home.aspx) of the controversies surrounding the mining industry.

‚ÄúGiven Tesla‚Äôs focus on sustainability, the company is likely to prefer to buy from miners of higher-grade nickel sulphide, which requires less power to process than laterite ore, said Lachlan Shaw of National Australia Bank.‚Äù-Reuters, Yilei Sun, Melanie Burton‚ÄúThere are three key suppliers - Brazil's Vale VALE3.SA, which operates in Canada using some hydropower, Russia's Norilsk Nickel GMKN.MM and BHP Group's operations BHP.AX in Western Australia. **""**[**Vale**](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/please-mine-more-nickel-musk-urges-as-tesla-boosts-production-2020-07-23) **is in the box seat,""** he said.‚Äù-Reuters, Yilei Sun, Melanie Burton

Just the appearance and attempt to be environmental is enough to scare away most journalists who are looking to make a hit piece on Tesla. To wrap it up, Vale has the efficient, sustainable, and environmental mining that Elon Musk is looking for.

**News Doesn't Care About Technical Analysis**

No matter how good the TA setup is for $VALE, news does not give a FUCK about TA. If it has a catalyst to moon... moon it will.

**Cash Flow**

The increasing and regular cash flow has built a very strong balance sheet for VALE and the consistent high yield will keep the loyal investors around. In addition to this year's regular dividend, $VALE is paying investors an extra dividend of 1.63% on the same day as the regular. According to research firms such as CFRA, the management team has been very active and engaged to keep the company moving in the right direction despite COVID-19 setbacks and a decrease in steel demand.

**Competition**

$HNCKF (Giga Metals corp) a competing mining company ***fell*** 18.84% today after being in the news about [potentially](https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/tesla-discussions-low-carbon-nickel-supply) being a candidate for Tesla‚Äôs nickel demand. Currently, at a conservative rate, Giga‚Äôs mine would stop being able to satisfy Tesla‚Äôs Nickel needs by 2025, assuming they would be able to begin mining operations immediately. On the other hand, yesterday (Sept. 16), Vale announced that they had created buffers to reach production of 400 million metric tons of total mineral mining per year in a filing that was part of an investor tour presentation. Nickel is one of the five metals Vale mines.

**I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine**

Tesla and Vale already have a bidirectional relationship that GM and NKLA could never even dream of. Tesla and Vale have a history of working together. In March, ‚ÄúAntonin Beurrier, CEO of Vale-NC and Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, signed a contract, an offtake agreement for the delivery of intermediate mixed nickel and refined cobalt (Nickel Hydroxide Cake-NHC) produced in New Caledonia. The product will become part of Tesla‚Äôs battery composition. The purchased volume remains confidential.‚Äù-Tesmanian by [Eva Fox](https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/tesla-nickel-and-cobalt-contract-for-goro)  ([original french source](https://la1ere.francetvinfo.fr/nouvellecaledonie/tesla-contrat-nickel-goro-usine-du-sud-854234.html)). Tesla and Vale have already signed a confidential contract in regards to Tesla‚Äôs battery composition materials needed.

In 2019, Tesla hired an Engineer from Vale-NC to ‚Äúfacilitate procurement and familiarization with the products of the Caledonian plant‚Äù

""Tesla has recruited an engineer in a nickel-cobalt refinery in New Caledonia, that of Vale, in order to facilitate purchases for its large European electric vehicle factory in Berlin.""

**Vale using Tesla‚Äôs Lithium batteries at Guaiba iron ore port**

‚ÄúIron ore miner Vale is installing a Tesla battery energy storage system at Ilha Guaiba terminal in Rio de Janeiro state to help meet power needs at the port as it moves toward energy saving technology.‚Äù[\-London](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/082520-miner-vale-to-use-tesla-lithium-batteries-at-guaiba-iron-ore-port)‚Äú

The project will substitute 20% of the facility's power costs using Tesla manufactured lithium-ion batteries with technology contributing to decarbonization plans, Vale said in an Aug. 24 statement.‚Äù[\-London](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/082520-miner-vale-to-use-tesla-lithium-batteries-at-guaiba-iron-ore-port)

**Tesla‚Äôs technology is being used to lower costs at Vale‚Äôs iron ore** and to contribute to the ‚Äúdecarbonization plans‚Äù. If you remember in the Q2 conference call, Elon Musk was searching for *environmental and efficient* nickel. Vale has that now thanks to Tesla's battery technology.

***More Vale environmentalism***

‚ÄòVale recently announced investments of over $2 billion to reduce direct and indirect carbon dioxide emissions by 33% until 2030, in accordance with the Paris Agreement. Vale said it intends to become carbon neutral by 2050.‚Äù

""As Vale continues to decarbonize its operations, the use of batteries will become an increasingly important part of the electrification of our fleet,"" Vale's energy director Ricardo Mendes said in the statement.

""This project allows us to test new technology in the field and accelerate Vale's energy transformation, which aims to achieve self-sufficiency by increasing electric power generation mainly through solar and wind sources in addition to our hydroelectric power generation,""-[London](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/events/americas/caribbean-energy)

Guess [who](http://www.vale.com/indonesia/EN/business/mining/nickel/Pages/default.aspx) has a large nickel mine in Indonesia, $VALE

**Pricing and Math**

After calculating a very conservative estimate of how much nickel Tesla would be needing in the future, these were the results‚Ä¶ (see figure below)

With a *conservative* estimate of a $43 billion dollar contract, $43 billion minus the operating margin (38%)= $16.5 billion. This gives the stock 28% upside. The price target for $VALE is **$15.36** with a 5% variance giving a low at $14.80 and a high of $16.00 Not to mention the stock market acts very irrational in times of hype, the stock could very well overreact to $20+CFRA‚Äôs current 12 month price target for VALE is $15.00, whom most likely have not anticipated Tesla news. (If they get the news, this thing will FLY based on what we have seen this year)

Elon Musk [stated](https://youtu.be/3lvmOJGC_es?t=2295) that Tesla ‚Äúwill give you a ***giant*** contract for a ***long period of time***

&#x200B;

This is not taking into account that the price of nickel is lagging in comparison to its current and future demand. Current nickel price as of 9/16/20: $15,229.50 per ton

Once the demand for nickel goes up and the supply grows scarce, that's easy economics theory, nickel price goes up.

2021-01-10 11:34:31,When Reasonable Insanity Gets Out of Hand - TSLA,"üåà üêª content warning

TSLA is in for a reckoning. 

TLDR;  Tesla is being propped up by short term traders (read: austists and retards alike). I have no positions long or short in Tesla (not like this post fucking matters). 

Source:[The Reasonable Formation of Unreasonable Things](https://www.collaborativefund.com/uploads/Collaborative%20Fund%20Bubbles.pdf)

There is a distinct difference between volatility and things getting completely out of hand.

Stocks fell 19% in the summer of 2011, and quickly recovered. That‚Äôs volatility. The Nasdaq fell 80% after 2000, and didn‚Äôt recover for a decade. That‚Äôs something else.

But the fact that markets spread from volatile to utterly out of control -- like a bubble -- makes sense. Rational sense. It makes so much sense that we should expect it to keep happening.

One of the biggest flaws to come out of academic finance is the idea that assets have one rational price in a world where investors have different goals and time horizons.

Ask yourself: How much should you have paid for Yahoo! stock in 1999? The answer depends on who ‚Äúyou‚Äù are.

If you have a 30-year time horizon, the smart price to pay was a sober analysis of Yahoo!‚Äôs discounted cash flows over the subsequent 30-years.

If you have a 10-year time horizon, it‚Äôs some analysis about the industry‚Äôs potential over the next decade and whether management could execute on its vision.
If you have a 1-year time horizon, it‚Äôs an analysis of current product sales cycles and whether we‚Äôll have a bear market.

If you‚Äôre a daytrader, the smart price to pay is ‚Äúwho the hell cares?,‚Äù because you‚Äôre just trying to squeeze a few basis points out of whatever happens between now and lunchtime, which can be accomplished at any price.

When investors have different goals and time horizons -- and they do in every asset class -- prices that look ridiculous for one person make sense to another, because the factors worth paying attention to are totally different.

People can look at Yahoo! stock in 1999 and say ‚ÄúThis is crazy! A zillion times reve- nue! This valuation makes no sense!‚Äù

But many investors who owned Yahoo! stock in 1999 had time horizons so short that it made sense for them to pay a ridiculous price.

A daytrader could accomplish what they need whether Yahoo! was at $5 a share or $500 a share, as long as it moved in the right direction. Which it did, for years.

Money chases returns. Bubbles form when the momentum of short-term returns attracts enough money that the makeup of investors shifts from mostly long term to mostly short term.

That process feeds on itself. As traders push up short-term returns, they attract more traders. Before long -- and it really doesn‚Äôt take long -- the dominant price-setters with the most authority are those with ever-shortening time horizons.",39,0.72

SIX (three) years ago, this guy had tsla, said it was not just a car company. But see, how he says AES does the same thing and isnt getting as much hype?

I'm not saying AES will go to $1000, but I think it deserves a $23 price target, the one morgan issued BEFORE earnings. If they issue a new, higher one, AES has a chance of moving even further.

&#x200B;

[Heres a random picture for the retards who dont want to read, dont know how to read, are retarded.](https://preview.redd.it/q2h0vvskjaz51.png?width=303&format=png&auto=webp&s=69e013c001c457fbc7da63be40455828d66f1619)

Furthermore, AES has had massive call buying, if you check CVS, FISV, they had the same and ended up breaking out to the upside. Now, I'm no technical analyst, but AES is EXACTLY at its pre-covid highs, and just check the options chain for yourself on yahoo, or barchart. The volume and open interest is OUTSTANDING.

There is a serious chance for this stock to break out, wallstreet is waiting for a break to $23 based on the options. I have $1800 on the company!!! I can post screenshots if u really want. this is not a pump and dumb, tis is LEGIT DD!

**TLDR**: **read the stocks link post i gave, do you**r own DD, check analyst price targets in thinkorswim and compare how morgan price targets have risen and actually changed and accurately predicted price.

current price target from morgan is $23, calls that are crazy is like 22k in nov 20 (WEEKLY NOW!! WOW) $22 and 22k in dec 18 $22. So this option buyer predicts $22 AT LEAST?

&#x200B;

hmmmm?? you do the math boys. remember FISV and CVS, CVS had hard bottom support for so long between $55-60 and then came back to $70 after earnings. FISV had been in $95-$102 channel for MONTHS, easily swing trading calls at each bottom, now after its earnings, biden win and vaccine news it broke on monday out of the range super super. all of these stocks had this same options activity, massive call buying, no puts rly, juts calls crazy all rolling out every month too.",498,0.87

2021-01-01 05:33:45,The TSLA 2021 Trade Plan,"Happy new year WSB, here's my perspective on how to trade TSLA in 2021

**TLDR:**

Tesla enters 2021 with huge tailwinds. Bullish for the first half of the year. More caution in the second half as competing EV products start entering the market at an accelerating pace. Biggest risk is the market discounting the effect of strong EV competition starting in 2021. Avoid shorting TSLA.

# The 2021 TSLA trade plan

## What moves the stock?

Knowing that TSLA is decoupled from its business metrics, an inquisitive investor will wonder what drives the stock's price. The answer is partially uncovered by understanding who owns the stock. According to Macroaxis.com, as of December 30th, Institutions own 42.52% of Tesla's stock, the Public (i.e. Retail Investors) owns 37.46%, and Insiders own 20.02%.

>Institutional investors aren't selling

TSLA's institutional investor base consists of large passive funds such as funds tracking the S&P500 (which recently added TSLA) to more active hedge funds specializing in innovation and growth. Passive funds increase the buying pressure of TSLA while adding minimal selling pressure. Today, the majority of the workforce regularly contributes their salary to passive funds for retirement and said funds are unlikely to trim their holdings of a stock unless during an infrequent rebalancing event. The active funds that remain invested in TSLA tend to have celestial expectations for the company and are also unlikely to sell at this valuation. For example, billionaire fund manager Ron Baron believes that Tesla, currently at a $659 billion market cap, should be a $2 trillion dollar company. Another major fund manager, Cathie Wood, gives TSLA a 2024 price target of $7,000. Assuming minimal changes in total float, that equates to almost a $7 trillion dollar market cap!

So TSLA's institutional investor base are hardly sellers of TSLA and still believe there is significant room for the stock to run despite its incredible 2020 performance.

>Retail investors aren't selling

What about TSLA's retail investor base? This question is easily answered. Over the years, TSLA has built a diehard fanbase that has equally high, if not higher, expectations of the company than some of the institutional investors. Some people believe the company's CEO, Elon Musk, has developed a cult-of-personality. Tesla's cult-like fanbase manifests online as a large number of YouTube channels and online forums dedicated to the company, and in a broader sense, Elon Musk. For example, the main Tesla subreddit, r/ teslamotors, has more than 901,000 subscribers at the time of writing.

>Insiders aren't selling

Of the remaining 20% of TSLA stock, the majority is held by Elon Musk and he's certainly not eager to sell noticeable quantities of his holdings given the ensuing bad PR.

So if investors are hesitant to sell TSLA, TSLA is bound to appreciate aggressively every time there's good news and appreciate slowly in the absence of news as passive funds and its ardent fanbase continue to buy in. In other words, TSLA is a heavily news-driven stock with a heavy bias for upside.

This is exactly what we saw in 2020. TSLA entered the year having solved its Model 3 production problems while managing to maintain solvent. This act alone unceremoniously discarded a dark cloud over the company on whether it'll manage to produce cars at scale before its heavy debt-burden catches up with the company's treasury. With that, the path was clear for a string of good news to catapult the stock to grandiose heights. They included the opening of the Shanghai factory, the 5-for-1 stock split, the S&P500 inclusion, and record sales and deliveries in the third quarter. Even good news from the tangentially-related company SpaceX, who Elon Musk is also the CEO of, has been positive for TSLA.

# The Plan and Headwinds

Tesla will enter 2021 with boosted by tailwinds from its 2020 success. If Tesla maintains its current pace of execution, ceteris paribus (fancy business major speak for ""all other things being equal""), its stock price is expected to continue to appreciate and befuddle its critics. Tesla is finally able to produce Model 3's at scale, has a foothold in the Chinese market, and is readying to launch the Cybertruck to a red-hot North American pickup truck market. In addition, like Pavlov's dogs, 2020 has conditioned investors to not bet against TSLA with the stock shrugging off multiple negative news events like the COVID-19 pandemic, the expected post-S&P500 inclusion sell-off (which never happened), and the Apple EV announcement.

**In 2021, it's recommended to continue to avoid shorting Tesla, no matter how tempting.**

With that said, there are significant headwinds facing Tesla that any long positions should be aware of. Tesla currently has an 81.66% market share of the US EV market. The biggest risk going into 2021 and beyond is the significant ramp up in EV and battery technology competition from legacy auto manufacturers. Tesla's stock price has only emboldened the executive teams of these companies to pour significant resources into their EV businesses. GM, Volkswagen, and Ford are leading the pack. GM has invested $27 billion into its EV business and is planning to launch 30 EVs by 2025. Two EVs have already been announced: the Cadillac Lyriq and the Hummer EV, with both receiving an overwhelmingly positive public response. GM has also developed an in-house battery technology called Ultium that's the central pillar for its 2025 plan. A step above GM, Volkswagen is investing $41 billion into its EV business and plans to launch 70 EVs by 2030. It's also aggressively investing in battery technology. For example, Volkswagen has a large stake in QuantumScape, a company that claims to be developing a revolutionary solid-state battery technology. Last but not least, Ford is investing $11 billion into its EV business and plans to launch 40 EVs by 2022. Deliveries of its flagship EV, the well-received Mustang Mach-E, is already underway. An honorable mention goes to Apple, which plans to start production of its own EV in 2024.

If TSLA is a news-driven stock, a growing string of negative news about the company's shrinking North American and European market share should apply downward pressure on price. The worry is that investors are so exuberant about the stock's stellar 2020 performance that the effects of emergent, serious competition from legacy auto manufacturers are heavily discounted.

**In 2021, although it remains very bullish for TSLA going into the first half of the year, it's recommended to avoid aggressively starting or adding more to an existing position in the latter half of the year. This is when the rate of competing EV products entering the North American and European markets is expected to accelerate. Prudent investors should watch how the public reacts to this large structural EV market change before making any moves.**

So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of the last few days as I haven‚Äôt made a post since Wednesday, as I was busy making a full stock analysis on Amazon which you can check by clicking [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxurg0/amazon_stock_150_upside_amazon_stock_price_target/).

So, on Thursday we saw all 3 major indexes finish in the red, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MPQ6PVW) losing .12%, the [DOW](https://ibb.co/GJf3qV9) dropping almost 70 points and the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/r51hS22) dropping below $3800 to finish the day, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/sq1P6gm) rose again by almost 5%, though 70% of the companies were [advancing](https://ibb.co/yhsdpZD) on normal volumes with just 8 new lows, as 4 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/ZW0k1VD) finished in the green with Energy outperforming by quite some gap, while Technology was the biggest loser, as Large-Cap Growth companies were the [underperformers](https://ibb.co/jZW53gf), while small-caps shined, with all 3 segments gaining more than 2% for the day.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/hsmYfRz) from Thursday, with Amazon, Microsoft, Tesla, Netflix & Facebook all losing more than 1%, while the biggest gainers were the Semiconductors, Alibaba and some companies from the Materials and Oil & Gas Industry.

We also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/XZNYQHY), which for me came in better with a drop of almost 1% in bullish investors and 4% in neutral ones, as fear has reached almost 5% more investors in this past week, which is a good sign for opportunities in the stock market.

Meanwhile, Friday was even worse for the broad stock market, with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Ms5m47G) losing .72% as the [DOW](https://ibb.co/dKc4ZV0) dropped 177 points while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MkcyrQV) was the biggest underperformer dropping below $13000, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/RSGmvvN) continued to rise near the 25 level and even had a spike near the 26 level in the early morning, but overall finished the [week](https://ibb.co/SnvsgHc) down almost 3%.

We saw again 4 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/0GTqNZG) finish in the green, but this time Energy was the biggest underperformer, losing almost 4% and giving up some of the huge gains made up this week, while Real Estate was the only sector to post a gain of more than 1% and Communications continued to recover after a bad start to the week, as almost 70% of the companies were declining on [Friday](https://ibb.co/grwfwwM), with Large-Cap Growth Companies slightly recovering to finish the [week](https://ibb.co/vX2mxss) down only 1.2%

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/GdWj575) from Friday, in which you can struggle to find some bright spots, with the gains being concentrated in the Health Care & Real Estate sectors, while for the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/441kLYw), there is some more breadth with Energy, Banks and Semiconductors also posting some gains.

On Thursday we also saw [Powell](https://ibb.co/M7vznm4) reiterating the point that rates won‚Äôt be raised unless inflation becomes a serious problem, as he believes there is still plenty of room in the labor markets until maximum employment is reached, with this point being sustained by the increase in initial jobless [CLAIMS](https://ibb.co/X5brzGZ) which jumped almost 200K, a lot worse than expected and the previous month, as continuing jobless claims also jumped by about the same to 5.27M, a big increase over last week.

Moving on, Friday we also received more economic data, with the January [Consumer](https://ibb.co/n38hy4w) sentiment coming in at 79.2 lower than expected and the previous read, as consumers have lost confidence both in the current conditions and in expectations.

We also saw the New York business [activity](https://ibb.co/92Rydt9) coming in at 3.5, worse than the 6 expected and the 4.9 in the previous month, with new orders seeing an increase but being offset by a huge drop in shipments.

Business [Inventories](https://ibb.co/TRs2SMW) came in as expected at a .5% increase M/M, while Producer [prices](https://ibb.co/py4bpTn) rose less than expected and retail [sales](https://ibb.co/X2v2Y0Z) fell more than expected with a .7% decrease M/M.

This [WEEK](https://ibb.co/VqGMnJT) we start of slow, with no big data coming in until Thursday as we await the Biden inauguration tomorrow while the most interesting [earnings](https://ibb.co/B2T64dc) for me are Goldman Sachs as a continued read on how the banks are doing after last weeks good numbers, Netflix to see how the stay-at-home stocks will continue to perform and Intel to see how they manage to turn around things.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Aphria](https://ibb.co/nwxNpm0) beat consensus in earnings and starting a broad rally in pot stocks, while [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/vw4dXQ7) dropped more than 9% after CITRON went at them again, implying a drop back to under 100$ expected very soon.

We also saw IPOs soar again in the first trading day, with [PETCO](https://ibb.co/KwTHrvY) popping almost 50% and [POSHMARK](https://ibb.co/3cGk45W) more than doubling before dropping 20% as this IPOs are way overbought on every single launch just like most of the SPACs, with [Churchill](https://ibb.co/6JGGKHP) Capital also climbing huge on reports of a Lucid Motors deal, but this is only speculation and could have massive downside if the deal doesn‚Äôt go through.

Meanwhile, [Delta](https://ibb.co/FzGKp9C) Airlines reported Q4 earnings and hinted at a positive cash flow by late-spring or summer as they reduced the cash burn from $24M to $12M/ day in Q4, which helped most of the airlines rally.

Thursday was capped off my [Biden's](https://ibb.co/bzh0fsV) new relief package proposal that seems to be around $1.9T. This will serve probably as a start point of future negotiations. This package includes $400B in crisis aids including $20B for vaccines, $50B for testing, $30B for supplies and $140B targeted at helping schools reopen and stay open.

The plan also includes $1T in aids to individuals including $1400 stimulus checks and extending the unemployment benefits to $400/week through September, $30B in rental assistance and extending the federal moratorium on evictions and foreclosure through September and increasing the minimum wage to $15/hour.

Biden‚Äôs propsal also includes the highly debated help for state & local governments worth $350B & $50B in small business grants and loans. 

This will probably serve as a starting point and I don‚Äôt expect everything to pass even with the blue sweep. It‚Äôs likely going to be less than $1.9T, and most of the debate will continue to happen on the state & local help and is also likely to exclude things like increasing the minimum hourly wage, as this is not something temporary like most of the other costs and is likely to receive big roadblocks. This will likely be a short-term boost for the stock market, but the impacts of this in terms of inflation, debt and other economic factors are still unknown in the long-run.

And moving on, Friday we saw [Tesla's](https://ibb.co/Vqmf9Mm) forecasted deliveries increased to 1M cars by Wedbush who also raised their price target to $950 with a bull case of $1250, as the Tesla [Model Y](https://ibb.co/1Qws23d) has finally started deliveries in China and will be one of the biggest bets Tesla has made, as the affordable SUV demand is much higher than any of the other Tesla models, while in contrast [Nikola](https://ibb.co/r3dFQSk) seems to be having firms jumping board with an early investor recently selling over 7M shares. Some similar action was seen from the director of [GameStop](https://ibb.co/rvyQdvq) who sold 800K shares after the recent pop in the stock. This kind of companies provide high risk/high reward opportunities, but you should have a tight approach to them, you should take profits whenever you can and not risk losing your gains on these highly volatile stocks that don‚Äôt have a good fundamental basis.

So, let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/nr2Pw5W) markets seem to be pointing to a good day, as we await Biden‚Äôs pick Janet Yellen‚Äôs [remarks](https://ibb.co/bsjzK1b) on the proposed stimulus and the dollar while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/S3cfpZq) are also pointing to a green open, with the Nasdaq leading the way.

2020-12-10 20:00:09,PLTR and TSLA 12/11üöÄüöÄüöÄ,"Alright shit stains, here's my TA for Friday:

First off **PLTR**:

[PLTR 5D 5M](https://preview.redd.it/obkegves9h461.png?width=1578&format=png&auto=webp&s=36a7b0ff76b77688987e2f21b4290c56026bbe88)

&#x200B;

It is respecting the hard support zone of 26.95 to 27.30 (red lines)... for some reason it loves that zone, earlier in the week it dipped to this zone and stayed for awhile before dropping down to 25 bucks but as we saw today, it exploded right back to that zone and consolidated in it before breaking that resistance for a short period of time.

&#x200B;

Like I said 27.30 is a hard wall to break but with that being said, if PLTR breaks and can hold above this resistance... 

we will see 29.15...if it holds this level

**All. Time. Highs. Baby.**

Now **TSLA**:

This dirty slut of a stock has given me one hell of an emotional ride let me tell ya...

My personal opinion... I don't think we're going under $600 again for awhile! Wednesday was a complete blood bath and it broke all the way to the 570 range if you needed a friendly reminder. 

As we saw today, people took advantage of the TSLA fire sale and instantly brought it back up to the 1HR Supply zone at around $620-622. If TSLA couldn't break that initial $600 resistance...would've been blood bath pt.2.

Keep in mind that TSLA did bounce off of 635 and instantly fell and consolidated back down to the support zone I just mentioned above. Another friendly reminder...**$635 was the support on Wednesday that BROKE AND TSLA WENT TO HELL.**

If we can break and hold 624.90 resistance, TSLA will say hello to that $635 resistance again...if we break 635

Next stop is $650

2021-01-08 13:29:41,I thought $TSLAs chart looked familiar,"Some people need a serious reality check. This shit is ridiculous. The EV market is shockingly similar to the dot com bubble and its not even like people arent aware, its just that everyone thinks they will be able to sell their shares to some idiot at a higher price which has been true thus far, but that second people stop believing that we are in trouble.

I can already see people saying ""how did we not see that coming"", the writing is on the walls. Countless IPOs/SPACs with companies WITH NO REVENUE. Imagine 2 years ago, if a company with no revenue went public people would laugh. Now people will pay ridiculous amounts for QS, a company with NO REVENUE FOR 6 \*\*\*\*\*\* YEARS.

Companies jumping 10+% just because they announce they will be apart of the EV market. 

Maybe im just not chad enough, but I can no longer stay on this ride with you all. I wish you all the best.

I would absolutely love to write a detailed analysis on why I opened this position; but it would go to waste here.   
It is folly to cast pearls before swine.

Therefore, I'll surmise my post with a primitive form of autistic hieroglyphics.
