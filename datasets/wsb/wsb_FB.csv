2021-02-17 13:58:34,PLTR the next FB? YOLO EITHER WAY,"YOLO PLTR NOW DD (updated)

Updating my thoughts on PLTR from earlier this afternoon, but I just wanted to share an interesting case study from Facebook‚Äôs IPO back in 2012:

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/id/49824482

TLDR: FB and PLTR have many similarities in that they are cutting edge companies that disrupted the entire tech industry. The similarities are eerie: FB had a bearish lock-up period, just like PLTR.

Now, FB was off 40% from its IPO as the lockup approached (PLTR is up triple, but strangely ~40% off the highs), nevertheless, there is much skeptism with PLTR as there was with FB in 2012.

People wondered whether FB would be able to transition from PC to mobile... the Street questions if Palantir can secure a stable corporate client base. There‚Äôs worries about the lock-up expiration with PLTR, just like with FB in 2013 (see the link).

But here‚Äôs the whopper: I don‚Äôt believe this lock-up will be nearly as bad as ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù speculates. Sure, certain directors @PLTR might sell some, but why would they kill it all now? There‚Äôs too much potential.

Cathie Wood reaffirmed her support forholding this bad boy for 5 years by DOUBLING her stake yesterday. You‚Äôre a fool if you think Alex Karp and Peter Thiel are thinking much differently.

This negativity is overblown. Perhaps we see $25 on PLTR, but think: how much lower can we go? We are stuck at a $50B valuation right now, compared to $80B for boomer-based Snowfuck ($SNOW). 

A software that looks like COD (yes Call of Duty)-Gotham Foundry (bad ass name btw) that can prevent terrorist attacks and catch Osama Bin Laden??

A predictive AI that can help manage supply chains and forecast growth/risk? A tech wizard that helps oil companies strategize how best to transition to the renewables era?

Name me one damn company that does any of that, much less ALL of it and stores the data on a mega cloud for proprietary/client computing?

If you feel queasy or unsure, just ask yourself: who else does what PLTR does? A mega, all-seeing, AI mastermind that can solve problems across defense, technology, financials, and energy? 

Certainly ain‚Äôt POS C3.AI or Spermflake. By the way- those other names are wayyyy more *overvalued* than King Palantir.

So I‚Äôm personally doubling down and buying more shares/calls tomorrow. This is simply the greatest firesale engineered on a looming corporate giant in financial history, and we retail investors & enthusiasts are chumps if we sit this one out.

This isn‚Äôt a short squeeze or a big short or any other financial gimmick. This is just about markets recognizing talent, and as more retail investors (us strong ü¶ç) and institutions (who are currently üåàüêª on PLTR) get in, $PLTR will send it to the next dimension.

POSITIONS (very highly requested): https://imgur.com/gallery/pldEQsP

UPDATED (2/18): WOW! Mama Wood just bought 5.3 million more shares TODAY, adding it to her flagship ETF $ARKK for the first time. Feeling ballsy enough to say the lock up is over and to Mars we go. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Reload, double down, do it all!

This is the firesale of a lifetime on the next Google/Facebook. On days like today, you BUY PLTR with a take-no-prisoners attitude. 

Considering Cathie Wood doubled her PLTR stake yesterday, I don‚Äôt feel too fucked in the head.

Reloading on shares and $40 calls, and if this corrects to $25, Wall Street will be asking me to do some pretty ridiculous DCAG trades.

The earnings frenzy starts with Apple, Tesla, Facebook & Microsoft reporting. GameStop, GM & Ford spiked last week, let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of Friday as we saw most of the stock market giving up some of the big gains of the week, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/ZxdGSkm) losing .30% & the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/MRn5Q40) Industrial dropping 179 points while the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/F3wm2d8) barely managed to post a small gain for the day as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/JRkwsZn) ticking up a little but finishing under 22 for the week, with the Nasdaq gaining 4.2% in the short week the SP500 rising 1.9% and the Dow Jones posting a .6% gain.

About 55% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/hFF1hSm) were advancing on below average volume as the number of companies moving above the moving averages still remains very high. We only saw 3 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/pPJpQCk) posting small gains for the day while the biggest losers were the value play in Financials, Energy and Industrials, all losing more than .50%

For the week we saw communications outperform with a big spike after Netflix reported earnings, while Energy had more than one ugly day dropping big on Monday, Thursday and Friday.

Small-caps faired better to close out the [week](https://ibb.co/y0C39gJ), with all 3 groups posting gains of more than 1.5% while Large-Cap Value companies underperformed losing more than 2.5% for the week, as Growth Companies & Especially the big-caps finally outperformed this week, gaining 2.3%.

Here is the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/MnWSRV4), which was a pretty mixed bag, with Apple posting a big gain ahead of the earnings report while the other big tech companies also posted small-gains. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/BfYRHWS) though, we saw huge gains in most of the big tech names with all the FAANG names and Microsoft gaining more than 5% for the week, while Banks alongside Oil & Gas companies were the biggest losers

We also got some economic data on Friday as existing home [sales](https://ibb.co/KWxRW9m) rose again while the inventory is still at all time-lows of under 2 months of supply while the January [PMI](https://ibb.co/x54dqCy) current read came in at 58, way above the 55.5 expected and 55.3 in the previous read as both the Services and Manufacturing PMI saw a spike of more than 2 points

This week we also start the [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/2nsRvBx) frenzy, with AMD which might benefit from Intel‚Äôs drop last week, Microsoft & Starbucks reporting after Tuesday‚Äôs close as JNJ might also give some updates regarding their vaccine, while big value companies like Boeing, AT&T & Caterpillar report before the open on Wednesday & Friday. We also have some of the big tech names reporting on the same day, with Apple which is expected to have their first $100B quarter, Tesla & Facebook reporting after Wednesday‚Äôs close which might be a bigger volatility moment for the market depending on how the results come in.

In terms of economic [data](https://ibb.co/Fx6TWyw), we start off [today](https://ibb.co/4K4DDvp) with the Dallas FED Manufacturing survey but the most interesting ones are on Thursday & Friday, while we also wait to see what the FED announces in terms keeping the rates low & the money printer going with asset buying on Wednesday.

In some other stock market, we saw [Palantir](https://ibb.co/zV2vxft) soar on Friday, rising more than 25% to break the $30 levels after they updated their Demo Day scheduled for tomorrow. It‚Äôs expected that they will reveal the latest developments in their big software platforms and also reveal [new](https://ibb.co/swYH61R) software platforms that will continue to help the company grow such as SDDI, Low-Code/No-Code and other modular strategy software.

We also saw [Ford](https://ibb.co/D8cmmZn) soaring again, as the company is having the best monthly performance in more than 10 years and spiked more than 6% after JP Morgan upgraded the company based on their new product line which is what I‚Äôve been saying about the company in some months now. Tesla is going to face serious competition in the next decade with all the other car manufactures pushing harder and harder into the EV world, with some of the most popular cars out there like the F150, the Bronco and other models joining the sector that will continue to improve and might actually become a good alternative to Tesla‚Äôs models. It‚Äôs the same with others like [GM](https://ibb.co/42G3ttK) which might be a good catch-up play compared to Tesla. By the way‚Ä¶ [GM](https://ibb.co/vPwbPCs) is outperforming Tesla recently based on their developments in the EV & self-driving sector.

Meanwhile, [GME](https://ibb.co/bXYsj4k) had a wild day on Friday, gaining more than 50% despite being even higher as the battle between WSB & the shorts continues, with this move making Citron‚Äôs Left deciding to avoid further talks about the company probably in an attempt to avoid future attention at the GameStop short squeeze. Short Squeeze has seen a big rise in terms of [search](https://ibb.co/qn51BPH) interest after these latest moves in the GameStop stock and might even put more pressure on the bears, as retail investors might run up this stock even more.

So, guys, this week might bring a lot of volatility depending on many of the important events we have. Earnings seasons & especially big tech results will be important to justify these high multiples most of the tech names have received, while we also have to see how the GDP comes in, as it is expected to have seen a 4% growth for the 4th quarter while the FED is under pressure to keep the money printer on and the rates low, if not, or if there is any doubt in their commitments and also some numbers come in worse than expected we might see the long-awaited correction/pullback. But I don‚Äôt think numbers or the FED are going to disappoint really, but that doesn‚Äôt exclude the possibility of the pullback‚Ä¶ keep investing safely & have some money available to buy the dips if they appear, use them as a buying opportunity, not a panic sell.

So, let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/929L2rz) are pointing to a very good open, with the Nasdaq leading the way up almost 1%

2021-01-19 10:10:31,FB -> Stupidly Undervalued. Position: $200k LEAPS [Not YOLO],"Alright, ya cucks. Here's another position for ya.

FB is the most undervalued mega tech growth stock on the market today. Period. I've heard the most insane statements with respect to the future of facebook as a company. ""This is the end!"", ""Everyone's deleting their accounts!"", ""The scum of our society!"", ""Trump will teach them!"", etc....

No one gives a fuck about your conservative right wing viewpoints. No one gives a fuck that you deleted your account (you have zero influence on the global population). This company will continue to steal your wife's boyfriend's daughter's soul and print cash to the cows come home.

Are you still not listening? This company has data on 40% of the global population. If there is nothing else to take away from this. Trust that this company will monetize that data over and over and over again. They will figure out how to make you an addict. Like heroin to the vein. Like you getting cucked by Jimbo the plumber.

Social media is officially a VICE. Same shelf as sex, drugs, gambling....I'll put my money behind these categories every day of the week.

Anyways. Take a look at growth. This company's earnings are ripping YoY. PEG ratio under 1. Forward P/E is trading like a boomer stock in today's environment.

SHUTUP and buy facebook before you realize you were a fucking idiot for not buying facebook.

""BUT ANTITRUST!"" Shutup. Buy facebook.

**Position: 55x Jan 2023 $300C.**

UPDATE: Earnings are next Wednesday, if you want a cheaper and riskier play, buy $265-$275 with term that straddles earnings. I would buy into Feb/March. Rockets.

2021-01-20 12:35:26,"FB stocks will drop, because ad revenue will drop","Let's go straight to the point.

Apple announced in 2020 that they plan to increase the level of privacy of the iOS users, with the release of iOS 14. What does that mean concretely?

\--> As soon as you open a new app, they will ask with a pop up ""Do you allow this app to track you across different apps"". We expect that 10 to 20% of the users will say yes. Bumble officially said while filing their IPOs that could be a major risk for them, to do proper analytics on their users.

Therefore, all the apps relying on paid acquisition, won't be able to track where you are coming from, and if you are a rentable user. Therefore, it makes it even harder to create profitable user acquisition campaigns on mobile. Those who will suffer from it are casino, midcore, casual games, as well as all the apps relying on paid subscriptions. It will provoke a drop of eCPMS (price per 1000 impressions of ads), as there will be less demand on the ad networks.

Certain networks will suffer more than other, but the biggest one is Facebook.

99% of the revenue of Facebook is coming from ads. It means that they will still be able to do targeting on Facebook itself, but not on the networks of apps that run ads (like all the games). Facebook is a key player in this industry, and this will certainly provoke a drop in terms of revenue (9M businesses are relying on their ad network).  They officially said that IDFA change (this iOS privacy update) "" Could Have A Material Business Impact"".

Apple postponed their measure to Q1 2021, but this will come.

Google usually follow suit with these kind of measures.

More info:

 

1. Some quotes:

Facebook [published](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2020/06/18/value-of-personalized-ads-thriving-app-ecosystem/) a blog post outlining a test it had conducted comparing how revenue differed between personalized and non personalized ads on its Audience Network. Facebook said it observed ‚Äúmore than a 50% drop‚Äù in publisher revenue when personalized targeting was taken out of the equation ‚Äîthough it didn‚Äôt publish a detailed outline of the study.

2. The iOS market is the most profitable mobile market. It represents around 50% of the total revenue for app publishers, while only 27% of mobile owners have an iPhone.

3. In any case, the advertisers won't be able to track properly the performances of their campaigns. Even if they will still be able to target users, they won't be able to know how efficient it is, as we used to today. Moreover, if you increase the amount of ads in Facebook, this will definitely have an impact on the retention rate / session length. This is a lot of fine-tuning, but the solution isn't there.

&#x200B;

TLDR : Significant drop in terms of ad revenue on mobile due to the new iOS privacy change. It will prevent targeting and tracking of the users. Facebook will suffer from it like crazy, as well as other ad players such as Unity, Ironsource (IPO soon) or Applovin (IPO soon), and apps Bumble (IPO soon).

Play : Wait for Q4 Revenue annoucement of Facebook. Then short Facebook until next quarter, when the measure will show its impact

2021-01-12 10:07:16,"$FB - ""Ready Player One""","Hello community,

I have been writing this post for several days, and I have been trying to find the simplest way to persuade people to starting buying deep calls on FB.

This is all about Other Revenue, specifically the Oculus Quest 2, the first stand alone independent VR headset.

**Other revenue.** Other revenue consists of revenue from the delivery of consumer hardware devices and net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure, as well as revenue from various other sources.  - This is straight from their last 10Q.

&#x200B;

[Other revenue figures ](https://preview.redd.it/o80iptfhuxa61.png?width=1880&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ee5eef4d398e60ea6710d65c885e75635a4ce66)

As you can see Other Revenue is growing over the past year with the Oculus getting phased in, but it actually slowed this Q. That is all going to change.

Oculus Quest 2 is selling like fucking hot cakes around the globe right now. It does not take a genius to understand that marketing is all over the world right now from digital to NBA courts. Facebook is hitting it heavy. Do you know why?

&#x200B;

There is an entire eco-system already established that is friendly to the consumer. There are HUNDREDS of games already created that can fill the sales channel. Oculus has been around over a decade. A massive increase in users will only yield more gains.

Lord Zuckerberg already explained the massive momentum Oculus is having down line:

*""This quarter we also took major steps forward in building the next computing platform. We launched Quest 2, our most advanced virtual reality headset, right in time for the holidays. It delivers a real sense of presence ‚Äî like you‚Äôre right there with another person or in another place ‚Äî and we‚Äôve worked to make it accessible to more people. It‚Äôs lighter, faster, has a sharper screen, and a new price point of just $300. Pre-orders have outpaced the original Quest pre-orders by more than 5x and have surpassed our expectations.""*

[Quest 2 Pre-Orders 5x That Of The Original Quest According To Zuckerberg - VRScout](https://vrscout.com/news/quest-2-pre-orders-5x-oculus-quest/)

Facebook is selling everyone one of these at a 10-20% loss for Cost of Revenue, but they are filling the sales channel with hundreds of diverse games. I have already spent nearly $200 on BeatSaber, Population One, and dumb as shit my kids want to play. These games have already been around for several years, but its fresh material for 8 to 20 year olds ready to play that just got their Quest.

On to the options trading and the buying opportunity. Angry people on the internet are causing Facebook to lose -15% of their value over the past two weeks, because of something Twitter did. No one gives a fuck about Twitter. The Feb 260/265/270 calls are getting hit fucking hard. There have been huge 5,000 block trades initiated over this week and I will be following.

These things are insane for absolutely fucking anything that sells a shit ton of data. For example look at robinhood: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/robinhood-investing-for-all/id938003185](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/robinhood-investing-for-all/id938003185). They collect a shit ton of financial information, but that is expected. However, look at something like Instagram: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252). They absolutely collect everything. I'm surprised people aren't already significantly complaining about it. Once this reaches mainstream, people will start complaining on Twitter about Facebook and Facebook will either have to suffer a loss of customers, or they will change their policies to collect less information.

There are probably smaller market cap companies that will be affected much more by this, such as ZNGA, which sells location data to advertisers and depends entirely on mobile games. ZNGA puts are also extraordinarily cheap right now, they are priced for about the last week where ZNGA rose significantly. There are likely a plethora of stocks that may be affected by this news.

As well as this, AAPL and FB are having a bit of a fight, AAPL will likely win and the recent stock price comparison of the two reflects this. 

tl;dr: Apple's new update revealed that Facebook attempts to collect your credit score, other data. FB and other mobile app companies that sell data bearish, AAPL bullish.

Pos: Only long AAPL shares so far, will probably get my first ever put of 9p 1/15 on ZNGA at open tomorrow.",120,0.94

Lemonade rises by more than 20% again while reports continue to come in on the Apple Car. Let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a big rally in the stock market after the [Biden](https://ibb.co/QpPkkvg) confirmation and Trump called for a smooth transition with the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/sw8bKdb) recovering the previous day losses and closing at over 13K. We also saw the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/MnjT8BH) gaining almost 1.5% and finishing over 3800 while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/ykPckZD) also posted a gain of over 200 points to close at just over 31k with all 3 of the big indexes finishing at new records. This broad rally pushed the [VIX](https://ibb.co/5MY0P1w) down, as the volatility index finished the day lower by more than 10% as 9 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/nmc7x8X) finished in the Green with Technology leading the way up 2.7%, while Utilities was the biggest laggard dropping by 1.3%.

Growth companies largely outperformed [yesterday](https://ibb.co/XpHGdhb) with both small and large cap growth companies posting big gains across the board, while value plays lagged behind, as 2/3 of the companies were advancing [YESTERDAY](https://ibb.co/NLLMyLY) with over 300 new highs on average volume.

So, let‚Äô take a look at the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/ys6zg6M) from yesterday, as big tech companies flourished with the likes of Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Nvidia, Tesla and many more posting gains at least 2%, while most of the losses were concentrated in the Chinese stocks that are being delisted and the more value heavy utilities sector.

Yesterday we also received the investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/10gRPgn), which saw a worrying move in the stock market, as bullish investors surpassed 50% of the total investors and is near the 1-year high from November. Most of this move to the bullish side came from neutral investors, which are way below the historical [average](https://ibb.co/XbyKxjB), which probably decided to get back in the market, rushing in the clean energy sector, the industrials and many others after the Democrats swept the Georgia election. I remind you that I usually use this survey as a contrarian indicator, when sentiment moves to this much greed in the market, I usually don‚Äôt like to add to my positions, as I await to buy stocks on red days.

We also received some economic data yesterday, as we saw December‚Äôs homes for [SALE](https://ibb.co/7Y3njz3) fall to an all-time low, below 700K as the housing market keeps on booming, with homes selling faster by about 2 weeks compared to last year while the national inventory dropped by almost 40% since last year, as the median listing price was $340K, up over 13% since 2019.

[Today](https://ibb.co/t4bS0wH) is a quieter economic day, with the biggest number coming in the early morning as we wait to see the non-farm payrolls.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Nikola](https://ibb.co/DLP8f1P) joining the broad rally in the EV [STOCKS](https://ibb.co/mJgVqwr) yesterday which pushed almost every single stock higher, while we also saw a report from JP Morgan on some possible good developments on their trucks. I don‚Äôt believe in this company, it‚Äôs bad history, bad management and reputation will hurt it in the long even if they manage to develop a decent product, which is still to be seen, as they haven‚Äôt really brought anything innovative to the market.

One other stock that rose yesterday was [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/FbZZ5Lz), as the stock spiked more than 27% yesterday, after the company was pitched by the Motley Fool yet again. I really like this company, and I think it has major disruption potential in the insurance world, so I agree with this report. The stock did suffer a slight pullback about a week ago after a report from The Friendly Bear but I don‚Äôt believe it will have a long-lasting effect, as I believe this stock has great growth potential.

[Apple](https://ibb.co/Xzscpk6) also seems to be confirming the previous reports and is in talks with Hyundai about a development of a self-driving EV, as we heard something about this from Hyundai before some confusion made them kind of back out of the previous statement. This report is pretty much as anticipated, as Apple would probably be looking to either collaborate on manufacturing with a traditional car manufacturer or actually just acquiring pretty much any one of them.

We also saw [Snowflake](https://ibb.co/vZ1v7yw) regain some momentum yesterday, rising by more than 13% despite the expiration period of another 38M shares. The latest IPOs and small-cap stocks have recently been able to raise a lot of capital as investors seem to be grabbing any share available at almost any price regarding valuations. This is a very dangerous thing yet again. This kind of stuff was happening in the last dot com bubble, though‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt really expect anything like that to happen with the overall stock market, but I think we might see some stocks have a big crash when valuations start to come back in the mind of investors.

Meanwhile we saw 2 big milestones for Tesla & Elon Musk yesterday as the company [passed](https://ibb.co/yXnFsbp) Facebook as market value goes as Tesla is seeing huge trading volumes as yesterday, it [traded](https://ibb.co/6BYkLP9) more shares than the next 3 big movers Apple, Alibaba and Amazon, while Elon Musk [became](https://ibb.co/xS0G5Sk) the richest man in the world, on the back of a 16% increase in Tesla stock already in 2021.

And two last pieces of good news are that the it‚Äôs expected the [FED](https://ibb.co/6FTNrSF) will likely hold rates near zero until 2024 while [Pfizer's](https://ibb.co/6nGSdWR) vaccine seems to be working as expected on multiple mutations, especially the latest highly transmissible one.

So, let‚Äôs hope for a good day as the European [markets](https://ibb.co/LdhPq9P) and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wSTgstr) are up to start off the day, with the Nasdaq Leading the way up over half a percent.

2021-02-10 22:54:35,How a short/gamma squeeze on Tilray is causing the ENTIRE cannabis market to moon and how to avoid becoming a bag holder when this all comes crashing down,"***Obligatory: SIR, THIS IS A CASINO. This isn't financial advice in any way shape or form.***

TLDR: This run is going to end with the cannabis stocks back down 50-80% or more from the levels they are at. **$CRLBF** is the real play here for the smart players that want USA exposure to the legislation. *We just like the stocks now, not later.*

Ok, listen up normies.

Yeah I'm talking to the newbies specifically because the OGs here already know everything I'm about to share, but your insufferable groupthink and movement mentality shit pissed me off enough to make a post. **Don't post DD if you have no clue. Ask someone for help and take your ridicule until someone comes along to help you.**

I used to post weekly DD on Sunday here a couple of years ago before one of you literally contacted my wife IRL. Not even kidding. So I made a new account. This is my first contribution back and I'm going to try and ensure some of you don't blow your chance at massive gains here by explaining ***what is actually going on.***

**CNBC and anybody telling you that this is just 'momentum' and 'sentiment' is lying to you. The hedge funds are playing these right along with us. Don't ask me for proof, this isn't Twitter. Reasons why they are playing with us:**

1. When there is money to be made, hedge funds and HFT funds are there before you
2. The floats are so small on these they can take sizable positions on both sides and stand to have massive gains, all the while handing you guys the bags.

That's all you need to know.

So in response to all you posting ""real DD"" with why these companies are the best and you're going to hold to the moon and never sell:

**I'm over it -- I can tell instantly how uninformed you are** when I read some poorly thought out DD about why CGC or TLRY or APHA is a long term play because they're talking about USA legislation. These are Canadian companies. Get your head back on straight. You're here for the trade and the bet, not for the fundamentals, and if that's it, then fine, ignore the rest of this post and pick an exit, and if not, read on so you don't hold more bags.

This place has never been one to care for fundamentals, but let me talk some sense into you so you can post some gain porn and I can tell you to fuck off instead of you guys all yelling ""MaNiPuLaTiOn ShOrT LaDdErS""

Let's take a look at some of today's gainers:

(changed tickers for automod avoidance)

**$USMJay** \- Penny stock, worth absolute nothing for a reason

**$SNDL** \- Up ridiculous amount, have a billion shares outstanding, just diluted them all the other day

**$TeeRTeeC** \- Terra Tech, they grow weed, from all indications, do it poorly

**$OhGeeEye** \- lol

**$HUGE** \- Probably the only one in the lot worth a YOLO on the chance they get an acquisition like GW Pharma did but they don't have the same product portfolio or prospects GW has.

&#x200B;

Now, if you're simply playing this to get in and get out, **great for you**. The people saying (and believing) ""$SNDL $10 EOW! HOLD THE LINE"" and stuff like this are just absolutely brand new normies and are clueless, do not listen to them. If you yolo'd on cheap calls in Dec/Jan, congrats, take your gains and don't be like the $GME bagholders.

If you're investing in any of the names I just posted above, expect any money you put in to at some point in the next 12 months be worth approximately 20% of what it is worth now. Literally. They're far worse than the main bunch (CGC, CRON, ACB, TLRY, APHA) but the main bunch is nothing to write home about either.

&#x200B;

# THIS IS WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING:

**Tilray had 40% short interest**. It's not $GME level, but it's pretty high. When the stock crested $40 it really started taking off, why though? Notice this week's FD option chain:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kyqeiwljeug61.png?width=917&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c1b48e12518515f09582289bd7f8a4f47a09629

Tilray has a 95M share float, those 42 calls represent roughly 1.5M shares held as a hedge just by themselves. Previous to this run up, that represents roughly 5% of the average daily volume of the stock, BY ITSELF. Those are shares that until Monday can be considered removed from the float because they're held as a hedge. They may get loaned out to be shorted, but that will only speed up the squeeze here.

***The important part: Today (2/10/21) the stock fell hard after open down to around 44 and found massive support all the way back to up 66. The most sold front week call? $40/$42 strikes. Premium when I screen shotted this? $22.20. Stocks going to pin above $60 for awhile likely, unless people are stupid enough to buy the OTM calls, in which case, it may squeeze itself higher.***

Smart hedge funds are going to pile into this, sell you the calls, shove the price up to keep selling you calls, then watch them all evaporate worthless in one of the future weeks in the chain, dump back the shares to help shove the price down, oh and did I mention? They shorted the top.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ivy78woneug61.png?width=392&format=png&auto=webp&s=0604940c09126dc6d5b96a9cc5f17e4013ae5d9d

It's just another plain old stock acting as a derivative of the option chain gamma squeeze. That's it, with a bit of short squeeze thrown in there and a WHOLE BUNCH of WSB fomo. The shorts are covering and pushing up the volume, likely re-shorting on the way up, and then you have WSB fomo'ing in to round out the total: a massive volume of 200 million shares today. You've got people that think this thing will skyrocket to 500+ (and it may) but the stakes get higher and higher each ladder up you take and the moves become more violent and more likely it comes all the way back down in short time the quicker it goes up.

Might it get there? Sure. But be prepare to take profits when it does because...

# ITS CALLED MEAN REVERSION. THIS CANT GO ON FOREVER.

Not to mention, the moves you are seeing are in completely overvalued companies, with horrible fundamentals, and poor prospects.

Oh what's that? CGC got some CBD treats for Martha, seems fitting that something ill is going on in this industry considering she went to prison for insider trading. If the dog treats get you excited about the stock, **Martha belongs here more than you do.**

200M shares today means people who were long term bag holders cashed out and the shares have turned over the float two times in two days. That also means the shorts have turned over and are now short again. It means the HFT firms are feasting on all of you. It means Citadel is making a pile on the spreads.

**What to take away: An amount of shares equal to the entire float has changed hands, or in other words, fewer reason for people to bag hold. Fewer people that have to hedge. Fewer people that have to cover. Fewer people to help stabilize any of these upper price tiers, and keep the price stable by holding, and more reason it's going to collapse sooner (or later).**

But, this IS a casino after all...

# Let's see what happened with TLRY last time this happened (oh, you're new here? Yeah, this isn't the first time):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p652mvgreug61.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=d95f2b0ccf946717859bffb28601dfd29e999e0b

Looks eerily familiar to something else recently. Last time this occurred it traded between $100 and $300 in a single week timeframe.

For those of you that are new: **THIS IS NOT NORMAL. STOCKS DO NOT ALWAYS DO THIS. You are in the infancy of a new age of trading, but people still know, fundamentals matter a whole lot more than everyone is leading on, and these valuations are getting extremely overextended.**

Eventually, in the first squeeze Tilray bled off until the pandemic hit and it piled down to $2.43 a share. At $2.43/share, I would have bought it. Even at $10/12/14. At these levels? You're just ultimately out of touch but I look forward to the loss porn.

***So in short, again: Sir, this is a casino.***

&#x200B;

Timeline of events, and how to not become a bagholder:

1. $APHA earnings are good, stocks pop a bit, and level off
2. Legislators pull a pump and dump since they probably have calls and say planning on some laws regarding changing the schedule of cannabis (notice: we will likely NOT get outright legalization, just re-scheduling)
3. $CGC earnings are actually awful, with the caveat they have profitability on the horizon
4. $TLRY gets a UK deal
5. $TLRY starts going insane - since $APHA is a reverse merger with a .81 value share to share, it starts pumping, people start buying the lower priced cannabis stuff and entire sector starts moving on ""overall strength""
6. There's no strength, there's a gamma squeeze backed by investor momentum, and a short squeeze on Tilray.
7. This is going to come back down violently then plateau out like GME and pull a slow bleed the rest of the way back down, just like the second graph I posted. There is no fundamental or even **POSSIBILITY** of better fundamentals immediately on US legislation. The cost to enter the US market will most definitely cause capex and goodwill capital outflows, and set back their profitability since there are established MSO's in the USA already. The USA opening the market to these companies will only further degrade the actual balance sheets/income statements and slow down profits and you know what institutions and shareholders like? **Yep. Profits.**
8. **Finally, how to not become a bag holder:** The market can stay irrational way, way, way longer than you expect. So this may go on for a bit, but refer back to 7. It's coming back down eventually, set expectations and pick your exit, or start to shave off your position as it goes up and let a portion of it run. Eventually, you have to sell to actually realize a gain, don't forget that. Once you do, close the chart, remove it from your watchlist, check back in on it in a month if you want to get back in when you have a clear head.

The Canadian operators are literally the last companies I'd play off a US legislation play, and one of the only ones worth owning in $APHA for the arbitrage play on the shares. But if Tilray comes crashing back down, $APHA will as well along with all of them, and you have to hope you lose a lot less on $APHA crashing than you'll make on the arbitrage between the share price.

THIS IS ALL JUST ""SENTIMENT"" BASED YOLOING BY THIS SUB. It has probably driven uneducated retail into the trades also - who will also become bag holders.

&#x200B;

***Let me put this in big letters for those of you that can only read big font and use crayons:***

# NONE OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE REAL USA MARKET EXPOSURE, THEY ARE CANADIAN COMPANIES. THEY DO NOT HAVE MARKET POSITIONING AND ARE NOT POISED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US LEGALIZATION.

*IF ANYTHING: IT WILL HURT THEIR BOTTOM LINE AND SET BACK EARNINGS BECAUSE OF CAPEX AND CASH OUTFLOWS TO GET A POSITION IN THE MARKET AND SOME OF THEM WILL GO OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE OF IT, WHILE OTHERS WILL FALL OUT OF PROFITIABILITY TO ENTER THE MARKET AND COMPETE WITH THE REAL PLAYERS*.

&#x200B;

*^(Who are the real players? (Cresco $CRLBF and Curaleaf $CURLF)* *^(- do your own DD or wait for a post next week)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)*

&#x200B;

**Conclusion: Nobody should plan on holding these long term. Don't let someone else hand you bags like I did this morning at open on the pop unless you plan to hand your bags off and find the next play.**

**You likely will not time the top. Pick a place you're ready to exit the trade, exit the trade or slowly shave your position, close the graphs and don't fomo back in. Just be done with the trade afterwards. You're likely not a cannabis multi millionaire and will not be one, unless you were loaded to the brim with low cost calls from last summer/fall or unless you literally yolo'd $10M into one of these a few weeks ago, and in that case, you belong here, congrats on your gains and fuck you.**

**THIS IS A SECTOR/FOMO SQUEEZE. AND IT WILL END. THIS IS NOT SENTIMENT AND CNBC IS TROLLING US WITH IT LIKE WE HAVE THE POWER.**

And if you think *WE* are the ones driving the price up, the hedge funds are definitely watching and playing and they can bring these down at will at almost any time they want. You're holding a lit molotov, the only question is: will you throw it before it blows up?

The rest of you? Plz fuck off with you 20 shares @ $2 on Sundial, fuck off with the ""HOLD THE LINE SNDL $10 EOW"", fuck off with your fomo, and **fuck off with the ""movement"" and ""lets push this to the sky"" stuff and most importantly don't post DD if you have zero clue what is going on.**

***You know what ""lets push this to the sky"" sounds like? Market manipulation.*** We're not in this together, I literally handed one of you a bag to hold this morning and even if they go up for another month, eventually, that bags gonna be heavy and I ain't coming back for it. I ain't tipping you either.

**These prices are insanely high for these companies. The multiples are out of control, and if you buy in at these levels, well, best of luck, I hope it works out for you. I'm fighting the fomo of extended gains, and will continue to put my money elsewhere.**

# SIR, THIS IS A CASINO.

Positions: I had the meme stocks like you literally all of them minus ACB and CGC. I took gains and bought 500 shares of Cresco prob increasing to 1,000 tomorrow, and kept the rest off the table to pay my wife's boyfriend's rent.

Disclaimer: I have Tilray puts I'm prepared to average down on and diamond hand like a real boss because this is coming back down.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Edit:** You know what I forgot to add? Some of the biggest holders, the cannabis ETFs and funds, you know what they did today? They trimmed their positions. And they will continue to do so because of fiduciary responsibility and when you de-concentrate shares into the retail's hands, the moves will get more and more finnicky and more and more violent.

**Edit 2:** Some normie tried calling me out like I never saw this trade coming or am a hedge shill, [https://imgur.com/a/asAVkiC](https://imgur.com/a/asAVkiC) \- I had thousands of shares, these are just the trades from this month, and I'm not advocating a buy, I sold mostly all of them this morning except for adding Cresco back in. You want the gain numbers? You do the math, I'm not your math tutor, I sold like 6 minutes after open for most of them. I have Tilray puts for next week and will be buying a few months out at various strikes as it continues to climb.

*Yeah, I think these are coming back down in price sooner rather than later, that isn't extraordinary information for a common sense person.*

**Edit 3: I'm getting piles of messages from people who used to follow my DD back in 2018/2019. Yes, it's the real SoRefreshing, proof:** [**https://imgur.com/a/Pn5LqCe**](https://imgur.com/a/Pn5LqCe)

2020-12-30 20:29:56,A Digital Advertiser‚Äôs Take on FB in Q1,"So I‚Äôm sure the iOS14 update and it‚Äôs negative impact on digital advertising / data collection is already somewhat priced into FB, but I don‚Äôt think people are considering how much it‚Äôll really impact their bottom line.

I won‚Äôt bore you with the technical stuff like apple getting rid of IDFAs etc.. but one huge update rolling out in March is going to be a required opt-in where people have to agree to let FB collect ANY of their data. I‚Äôm sure most people know this, but many don‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs estimated that just 15-20% of users will opt in. 

Another thing is these changes don‚Äôt only hurt FBs data collection and thus the quality of audience targeting, but it also severely impacts the ability for advertisers to track their conversions. So much so, that Facebook will soon only be reporting conversions that take place within 7 days of interacting with an ad. Advertisers are seriously upset with this as we‚Äôve always been able to track conversions for 28 days since the dawn of digital marketing. 

FB said they were going to implement it in October this year, but after a big uproar from advertisers they said they‚Äôll delay it until 2021 and that it could be as early as January. But they said that it‚Äôs definitely happening. Facebook definitely wouldn‚Äôt do this unless they expect performance metrics to drastically decline. 

This change is the part that I don‚Äôt think is fully priced in and I think it‚Äôll drive A LOT of ad spend away from the platform.

I know from experience that FB ad performance has been declining badly since around September this year and most advertisers feel the same way. People are already moving FB budget to other ad channels and I believe that after all the changes in Q1 it will drive A LOT of money away, especially when it comes to small businesses which make up a huge portion of their advertising revenue. There‚Äôs also agencies like mine which will have disgruntled clients and will want to move budget to Google, Taboola, etc.

TLDR - FB ad performance has been on the decline and upcoming changes in Q1 will make it much worse, thus driving A LOT more ad spend away from the platform than expected. The play is major puts after FBs June 2021 earnings report which I think will SEVERELY underperform",5,0.7

Where could they possibly get access to huge sets of data outside of their friends at the pentagon? There just aren't that many billion dollar database factories looking for AI vendors.

2021-02-02 15:16:32,Why GME is still in the game to trigger MOASS (MUST-READ BULLET POINTS),"Today was a crazy ride, and we've all been following the action the entire time. My opinion is that unless I can find compelling evidence that the squeeze is truly done for and off the table, my conviction has only grown stronger.

Most important things that stick out, all of which really build a case that must not be dismissed:

1) If shorts have covered, we should have noticed reasonable strong upwards momentum, as buying pressure consists of short covering along with retail buying, and a limited float.

2) Past few days we've seen trading volumes below average, likely suppressed demand caused by broker restrictions on buying. Lower volume can make any dump pull the price down easily. Especially when the demand side is getting locked out. Have to mention the timing of which Robinhood locked buying last week as well, coinciding with a massive dip.

3) Look at [this image](https://preview.redd.it/dralf2uks4f61.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=52223e916aacb4f65681da1cfe4f5e1ade7cea30)

Notice how AMC & GME have almost identical candlesticks, and the same is in the BB-NOK pair. It is undeniable that a lot of people are buying this stock and holding this stock. Not just in America but all across the world. We have global support.
You would think that with this many people in the trade (whether they are on the buying / selling side) we would see greater variance. This correlation to me looks like obvious manipulation by higher frequency and higher volume algorithmic trading.
It's hard to look at these charts and say that this is natural supply and demand. Seriously, same candlestick patterns on unrelated stocks. This price action is influenced by targeted manipulation to a high degree. Even if people were really selling off like crazy, wouldn't we see more natural candles?

4) We have mainstream media (MSM) covering the ""reddit mania"" extensively. MSM says reddit is trying to squeeze silver, which is false. You will not find anyone pushing to buy SLV on reddit. In fact, you will see a warning about silver and how many HFs have long positions in it.

5) We've seen an influx of bots on social media (reddit, FB, twitter) promoting silver, spamming that GME squeeze is finished, diverting attention away from the more uninformed audience. Why? If it's finished why the need for these?

6) MSM says the short squeeze mania is over and shorts have covered. If that is true, why are we seeing trade restrictions still on more and more brokers, and nonstop coverage all over TV and the internet. If it's over, why are there so many articles bashing retail to stay away?

7) GME is an outlier in the ""failed-to-deliver"" statistic, and has been put on NYSE short restriction (uptick rule). Something fishy is going on with the shares in the float.

8) SI% numbers are very conflicting. Especially the numbers that came around 30-50%. It was then later mentioned by someone in S3 that a different calculation was used. If you convert to the old calculation, you still get over 100% SI%. Why are they trying to change it all of a sudden?

To me, this is enough to say we're still in the game. If it's over, let them prove it by crushing GME to $20 and on February 9th we hear the official SI% being low. Then it's finished. Something tells me that it's not over, and this is all a ploy to mitigate the damage they are about to receive when GME eventually triggers the MOASS.

Can't say for sure it's a 100% trip to the moon and beyond, but what's really suggested otherwise? This whole misinformation campaign + price manipulation combo is too important to dismiss.

FB had a 142 billion market cap when added to the S&P.  The S&P announcement came on a Wednesday (7 trading days before formal inclusion and quarterly rebalance).  TSLA has 9 trading days before 9/18/20.

Wall street knows Tesla will be added to the index soon so there is no reason to sell shares because of ""Non-Inclusion news"".  They especially will not be selling before battery day.

I expect a retest of $500 before battery day.  There will likely be profit taking going into battery day and certainly after battery day if hype doesn't blow them away.

&#x200B;

TLDR:  No one has sold TSLA yet, the volumes during the past 4 trading days have not spiked. This dip will be bought and will see a retest of 500 going into 9/22 battery day.

2021-03-06 21:08:12,What GME has become,"GME by now has become a symbol of ""power to the retail investor (apes)"".

It's amazing to witness that during this economically tough time people are coming together and buying the stock and NOT selling no matter what.

Time, when profit is so precious and risk is unwanted. This shows how powerful retail investor can be once they unit.

Their will could break the backs of seasoned Hedge funds in a day and bring down the whole system in a week or two.

I applaud the strength and unity common investors have shown no matter what happens in the future with GME.

&#x200B;

GME stock holders / buyers are now worthy of getting called as part of the movement. Because it's not just group of people that are holding the line.

The line is being held globally, from Hongkong, Australia, china, Philippines you name it. This incredible sentiment will bind investors together.

I personally feel if Reddit IPOs then it will turn into Facebook and will no longer allow this free conversation / assembly of people and their thoughts.

But while it lasts, I want to congratulate every ape for doing what they did and still doing, hodling.

It's easy for millionaires and billionaires to hold but not for a common man like you and me who are getting whipped by this virus.

&#x200B;

Bravo:

Apes - all over the world who are holding the line, still.

Reddit - for not turning into twitter / fb and shutting down the group.

Reddit mods - for managing the exponential growth of posts and users from 4M to 9.5M with 3 months.

Cuban - support and ideas given to retail investors 

Musk - supporting the cause

Ryan cohen - for believing in GME

DFV - :D For not being a cat and liking the stock.

We all need to take a moment and think about how far we have come. We may go to the moon and (worst case) we may not but it's very worth while to acknowledge our progress and feel good about it.

Isn't it?

**State of the DD afternoon 2/18**

Reee I‚Äôd feel more like shit if the indexes hadn‚Äôt been bleeding all week, and I‚Äôm glad I got a couple multibaggers off this week. Taken the massive profit on QS and CCL. Putting much of them in longer dated calls on the ones of these I believe in including JD FUBO and PLTR, M NIO XPEV and WKHS. CCL needs to rest. 

If FSLY goes down any further I won‚Äôt be able to discuss it because it‚Äôll be a penny stock üôÑ 

VXX highlights why I‚Äôm frustrated about this: theory was correct all the way around‚Äî treasury yield, sector rotation, etc. but the underlyings aren‚Äôt cooperating. Glad I picked further dates and recommended that as well. 

Still stand by the theory behind these just making them longer term if they‚Äôre shorter and averaging down. My leaps and shares are doing just fine in boomer oil. 

Stay strong. Stay long. Soon the bears will be gone. 

PS- we need a better way for swing traders to update. I can‚Äôt track when I enter and exit here affective it.

**Update 2/18:** like the movement of the tech indices but sitting largely cash on my short swings now while those whole ‚Äòtaper tantrum‚Äô narrative figures itself out except for positions opened in $WKHS and JD near the bottom today. 

I don‚Äôt believe in buying puts and as such would rather wait it out than sell my soul

**R-E-L-A-X: 2/18 MORNING UPDATE**
**JD and WKHS getting high confidence flow. Agree or disagree, but reporting what I‚Äôm seeing. I am dip buying both 

We were prepared for this:

>	**As money outflows from big tech this past week post-earnings, we are seeing an expansion of call flow into more speculative industries like again like weed, EV, and forgotten titans like industrials/cyclicals, so forth.**  AnAlYsTS will try to scare you in the coming weeks and say tech is overvalued and done‚Äîthis is untrue, but the outflow/inflow tides of the market will present plenty of transition pain dips that feel like corrections.

This is why we went longer dated than usual, per intro instructions. Keep your VXX, feel out price movement this morning and cut anything risky short-dated. The CCL and QS war chest was mighty. Don‚Äôt just jump on sales, let the flow tell you what‚Äôs being bought. I‚Äôll scan and drop some tickers in the morning.

**State of the DD: 2/17 update 12:22 PM**

*please remember, these are WHALE plays. Follow the winners and cut the losers. High risk and high reward is what this is. If you are looking for the safe guaranteed growth stuff, grab some nice SPY leaps or something.*

Congrats to those who stayed with CCL and played the QS ER callout. Those tendies have staved off starvation for a night.  These are the reason we play. 

The PLTR rebound is indeed occurring with a boost from Cathie on CNBC as predicted. FUBO is also rebounding by strongly outperming the broader NASDAQ, and I expect continued performance with indices likely rebounding in the coming days. 

**FSLY calls are just absolutely fuk. Going to baghold some through ER as a Hail Mary.** Cant get much worse. Awful. I am ashamed. 

I am fine with the M price action for now. I am fine with VXX as it‚Äôs clearly needed rn. Trim a little each time it pops on VXX. 

I am holding off on that EV consideration for now except I opened a position in XPEV and NIO hoping post lunar new year buying will give us a little help in a beaten down industry. 2/26 ATM. TSLA has really turned it around today. 

Stay strong. Prayers up for the little homie FSLY üò≠ 

PS bought the WKHS dip 

**2/17 PRE MARKET UPDATE**

The latest retail numbers were outstanding during the report this morning, which as an interesting side affect have caused a giant spike in the treasury yield. 

For the uninitiated, higher treasury yields bring downward pressure on stocks. Will be watching closely to see if the yield flattens on the open. 

Hope you grabbed the recommended VXX; as I mentioned the stubborn treasury yield could present some short term issues.

FSLY PLEASE FUCKING FLY

**The state of the DD: Update 1 2/16**

When these positions open big, please wait for dips FYI. I believe in the plays, but you need to choose entry points with common sense discretion. 

**Correct** on the sector rotation into DOW/cyclicals. M hit decently, CCL smashed and saved my portfolio today with +9%

**Incorrect**:IV wasn‚Äôt enough to save a very shit day from FSLY‚Äî the DAQ was a whipsaw today, though, so that didn‚Äôt help. 

**Incorrect but frustrating** FUBO got an announcement today that Comcast was buying a 9% investment stake, institutional money continued flowing in, yet it tanked. I guess the shorts are too strong. 
EDIT: monster AH movement from FUBO

**How I moved** trimmed FSLY and FUBO but clutching still, and opened a big position in PSTH in the morning still holding. Holding CCL and M too. I update when I‚Äôm moving on twitter, but I can‚Äôt post that info here so maybe I‚Äôll just update here at the end of each day and maybe in the morning.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Hi.  Here's what I'm looking at headed into next week. **Shoutout to Unusual Whales who I‚Äôve spoken with and has given their blessing for me to provide these plays and screenshots. I recommend them bigly**

I monitor flow on Barchart and Think or Swim

I‚Äôve typically written about choosing close-dated plays, but I‚Äôm giving a little expiration room on these as I sense some sector rotation I want to feel out. 

Been on a nice little streak with these of late, so I am overdue for an account correction lol.  This is not investment advice.

*The whale plays I am interested in:*

[FSLY 2/26 110c](https://i.imgur.com/U00vNOa.jpg)üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ 

I like this for two reasons.  **The first is simple**: I've seen repeat call flow into FSLY building up over the past two weeks, and it just can't sustain the pops yet.  It's a similar pattern I saw to the DKNG and NIO calls before their pops.  *Continued betting OTM by whales gives me more confidence with each slip, and pressure for an upward pop is building.*. **The second reason** is the dump after the NET ER.  I love when sympathy plays get oversold, because it's easy entry into their earnings run.  

**How I‚Äôm going to play it**: I'll follow the whale on a call spread up to 110 for 2/19, and ride it up until just before earnings Wednesday, then cut it.  Successful strategy I've been employing with tech earnings runs lately; last week I just closed my eyes and threw a dart at TWTR OTM calls and rode it up for about 100% the day of.  Sure, you miss out if earnings are a banger, but I have an increasingly strict no earnings rule.

**Earnins run= yes.  Holding through earnings= no**

[M 3/26 20c](https://i.imgur.com/ybj1GMB.jpg)üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ 

Everyone always brushes aside my precious M plays but they are a quiet money-maker.  Once the dust has settled from the Great Memeing, M is back on watch again as a quiet beast finally waking up.  ER is on 2/23, and they have a couple things going for them, including:

**1) The B of A BBBY upgrade**: [bulls are returning on BBBY now that the squeeze is over and their reasoning is strikingly similar to the M story](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bed-bath-beyond-becomes-more-attractive-with-short-squeeze-over-b-of-a-says-11613076266).  Store closures?  Bullish.  Narrowly avoiding bankruptcy? Mega boolish.  But more importantly...
**2) Digital integration**: the CEO of M is actually a solid leader, and has really pushed the transition to digital and online merchandising.  I think this pivot will gain more spotlight headed into ER.

**How I‚Äôll play it**: M is a super streaky stock that can give you 8% return multiple days in a row, but can also frustratingly do the opposite.  It also tends to really crater in the mornings before stabilization and rising late in the day.  I will give this manic whale a chance on the 3/26c, while also clutching a more reasonable 16c 2/26 into the ER.  I will cut the 3/26 20c at the first sign of multi-day trouble

[VXX 4/1 20c ](https://i.imgur.com/kmKd8NC.jpg) üöÄ üò≠ 

I have long been a consort of the mystical VXX, and [here is a previous DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jfhdta/volatility_for_dummies_vxx_uvxy_vxx_and_spy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) I did on how it works.  It is approaching absurd lows, fear and greed is rising, and all that other doomed shit you hear.  What really signals to me this is the time to expand this hedge is the potential for sector rotation (and the currently happening rotation).  **As money outflows from big tech this past week post-earnings, we are seeing an expansion of call flow into more speculative industries like again like weed, EV, and forgotten titans like industrials/cyclicals, so forth.**  AnAlYsTS will try to scare you in the coming weeks and say tech is overvalued and done--this is untrue, but the outflow/inflow tides of the market will present plenty of transition pain dips that feel like corrections.

**How I‚Äôll play it:** a VXX 16c 2/26 feels right to purchase on a Tuesday dip meant)


[CCL 3/12 25.5](https://i.imgur.com/zfdoec7.jpg)üöÄ üöÄ 

Another one that has seen a lot of call pressure building up.  This cruise line seems like it's just waiting for more favorable news to give it a huge push.  *I understand and agree with the problems with travel right now: this is not an endorsement of the end of COVID, but I like the stock*, and I like the potential for upward movement.  I'll likely play this one as the whale has and exercise patience.  Has potential for wild swings, though, so keeping a close eye on this one.

**EV grab bag: TSLA 3/19 970c NIO 3/5 67.5c WKHS 2/19 46c (QS assorted strikes for ER run &?upgrades, and FSR off upgrades)**üöó üöÄ 

Major call flow into both NIO and TSLA all week; my last DD I was able to successfully pinpoint this movement into NIO, and it feels similar.  **QS and FSR got lots of attention after upgrades and into QS earnings, but the titans are positioned to explode after some from frustrating coiling**. NIO in particular lately has been moving slower than a white man in slippers.  TSLA is a pricey ass premium, so maybe consider focusing on NIO or call spreads.

**BONUS**: QS earnings could be when they finally reveal their revolutionary technology which prevents dendrites. This is the holy grail of EV battery production, and they boldly claim they have figured it out. The lawsuit is standard hot air from people upset their stock tanked in this weird ass meme of a market and I am unbothered. 

**WKHS dip feels like it was a blessing,** but I may wait for a little more dip on Tuesday because this thing is streaky as fuck.  People could be positioning into the Q2 (hopeful) EV deal announcement with the USPS.

[FUBO 2/26 42c and 2/19 56c](https://i.imgur.com/blCr0q3.jpg)üöÄ üöÄ 

**EDIT: shoutout to /u/4p0rn0nly who pointed on that the 55c has a more favorable bid/ask spread and vol/OI. This is why I keep that inbox open!**

As I was on my ROKU with the gf looking for the latest episode of ""My 600 LB Life"", got confirmation bias through an ad for FUBO lol.  More importantly, Benzinga picked up that dude from Twitter Mr. Zack Morris as an excuse to put it on their watchlist.  We all know how pumps go at this point: 
Random twitter ---> Benzinga (or other random watchlist) pickup ----> random analyst upgrades ---> CNBC pump ----> several crisis segments dedicated to WSB for MaNiPuLaTiOn

**General theme I am seeing:**

*Call flow into into big tech has really, really dried up*.  I'm hoping this continues into next week, because then we could be in a really nice position to pick up some March and April monthlies in struggling behemoths like FB.  TWTR is doing it's thing, but it seems like the looming AAPL privacy concerns have put a stranglehold on other big tech companies relying on advertising data.

**Play I just like this week:**

[PLTR reports Tuesday Premarket](https://i.imgur.com/MkoiiWz.jpg) and I think there is a chance to hop on no matter the outcome.  Sells off because earnings these days are stupid?  Buy the dip.  Starts to rocket off some news or a beat?  Hop on.  PLTR feels like a win-win rn at this price point no matter the earnings report brings.

**Fellow Bulls beware:** üêª 

Quantitave Easing is taking a hit.  [Quietly last month, the FED announced they were discontinuing the repo program; nobody noticed this but we had a huge dip that day](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/fed-ending-term-repos-reflects-liquidity-feast-for-dealers#:~:text=The%20Federal%20Reserve‚Äôs%20decision%20to,term%20repos%20set%20for%20Feb.&text=Overnight%20repo%20operations%20will%20continue). Treasury yield also has been stubbornly climbing.  Long story short, these are caution flags for an outflow from stonks into stable long-term securities.  Not ringing the bear alarm, but just shit you should know.

I change this a bit on Mondays based on what I'm seeing, as they re the most accurate days according to statistics. (Tuesday this time)

**TLDR**: 

Tech calls drying up for the meantime, looks like the outflow could be headed to speculative sectors, particularly EV.  Potential DOW flight coming.  Hedge with VXX pretty heavily, and retail that is doing digital integration may get the proper spotlight now post-meme.

While everyone says companies are ""getting a pass"" on Q2 earnings the stock is still going to get absolutely destroyed.  I have used Facebook Advertising and part of it's draw is it's simplicity.  No contracts or subscription, just set runtime and amount you want to spend.  Very easy to turn off.  So when all these companies shut down(and continue to struggle) Facebook ads where the first to go.  

So right now the stock has big headline risk given all the big names pulling ad spend(means nothing to bottom line) and what will be the biggest FB earnings miss off all time.  This Titanic is going to have one hell of a correction.

2020-08-31 15:14:37,FB to the moon - longterm DD,"Alright retards, I already know what you're thinking: Facebook is a dying dinosaur in the social media world because the next generation looks at it as their parents' social media; the play is too risky because of the Fed's suspicion, blah blah blah. Theres one thing you're forgetting: what the dystopian future is going to look like.



1) FB Yardsale groups became popular throughout the last several years, so much so that FB added an official Marketplace feature to their platform. [This nerd](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/29/how-facebook-marketplace-replaced-craigslist-in-2020.html) wrote an entire article about how FB marketplace replaced the need for craigslist in his personal life. Im currently downsizing my stupid material possessions so I can have more money to invest for sweet tendies, and I too am using FB Marketplace instead of craigslist. Why? It's attached to peoples profiles, rather than the shady anonymity craigslist offers. 

This month, FB released Facebook Shops which gives businesses with FB pages a webshop directly on the social media platform. This is brand-spanking-new, and has the potential to compete with Amazon in a major way. I buy shit off Amazon all the time, and a lot of the stuff sold there is cheap garbage made overseas. The Coronavirus pandemic has woken Americans up to the dangers in relying on foreign manufacturing for the majority of our goods, and I predict that we will see a rebound in American manufacturing in the next decade.

As this rebound occurs, more and more businesses will be looking for a way to brand, advertise, and sell their product online. Historically Facebook has offered the first two of these services, and now they offer the third.

2) FB Horizons. FB has been one of the leading companies putting research and development into virtual reality. FB acquired Oculus in 2014 for $2b. In 2017 Zucc came out and said FB will likely spend up to $3b in the next decade on VR research and development. Their interest is not only in VR experienced and games, but also in building an actual virtual world. [Forbes is already reporting](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyhackl/2020/08/30/social-vr-facebook-horizon--the-future-of-social-media-marketing/#1985f3f85b19) on the potential economic implications of Horizons, which could effectively create virtual townsquares wherein individuals could purchase goods with the convenience of online shopping and the personability & experience of shopping at small local businesses. 

3) Libra. Zucc has been spending some time in front of congress recently as the boomers there grill him with a confusing mixture of interest/excitement and suspicion/angst. One of the Fed's main concerns is the desire for Libra Project to house their cryprocurrency in Switzerland rather than the US. Even if Libra is cucked by the big dick of the federal government, there's nothing anybody can do about an internal currency system. If Libra isn't able to have success in the ""real"" world, then it still could exist in the new virtual world that Facebook is creating. If Libra does have success in the real world, thats all to the better for FB.

The expansion of research into VR is peeling back the covering of an uncomfortable but certain truth: we still don't fully understand the depth and power of what the internet truly is. In 5 years your wife's boyfriend will be able to own a VR brothel where you and a horde of other simps cough up zuccbucks you made selling shitty crystal bracelets to nomadic hippies through FB Shops so that you can be rewarded with an orgasm delivered by electrical stimulation to your prostate via Papa Elon's neuralink. That is of course unless you ride the Zucc wave to tendie town between now and then.

2021-02-12 23:00:16,$TSLA is positioned for a massive reversal,"Tesla's current market cap is the result of multiple positive feedback loops which has pushed its price to a ludicrous level via Short + Gamma Squeezes (it is also important to note virtually all TSLA shorts are out^(1)). This campaign has been largely led by large hedge funds. Without S&P inclusion, the story might have ended there with hedge funds trying to escape with their profits and leaving retail the bag. However, S&P inclusion presented these hedge funds with a much better option to close out their positions while also riding the stock down. The shares that hedge funds no longer wanted began to be picked up by passive funds leading to selloffs by the active funds which pushed prices to this level.

With passive funds holding the bag, the hedge funds which lead the rally seem to be attempting to push the price back down through a reverse gamma squeeze^(2).

No retail trader is buying 1m+ in deep OTM puts, this is an attempt by hedgies to push the price down.

We can also see this from the massive shift in options volume. $190B of calls open interest and over $250B of puts open interest, a massive put skew. This is especially significant because ""To put it in context it is equal to the combined $AAPL and $AMZN bullish skew or if you‚Äôd rather to the combined  $BABA, $FB, $MSFT, $GOOG and $WMT combined."" reflecting extremely bearish sentiment in an very very bullish market.

Once the reversal begins there will be nothing stopping it as OTM puts get less and less OTM. There are no shorts left to be squeezed and the bag holding passive funds which are largely barred from holding derivatives will have no way of rebalancing the options skew.

2021-02-22 20:08:25,I think PLTR is invincible rn and in the long run.,"So... this could be a bit long, but let me double down  on my thoughts on PLTR. Recently, we‚Äôve seen a little turmoil in the broader market that has scared some growth investors, and I do think there is some justifiable fear.

A lot of folks are going to tell you this is a great discount on names like TSLA or PLUG, and I certainly don‚Äôt disagree with them- I just want to have all my bases covered.

Now we have seen some structural shifts in the broader market. The 10-Year shift up to 1.35% is a noticable tick up, and this is something all of us ü¶ç have to be wary of.

As much as I like discounts, when the market prices in tighter money, the Fed will have to listen. I believe Uncle Jay will continue to have the market‚Äôs back, and I think the 10-Year should be capped at roughly 1.5-2%. We‚Äôll see how this develops, but the bottomline is these forward-looking growth giants are going to get CRUSHED if they miss expectations.

And well, if technology continues to be a deflationary pressure through innovation as we all expect, then üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ regardless and we can cap the discussion here.

So here‚Äôs where sweet good PLTR comes into play. I really, really like how they delivered earnings last week. Didn‚Äôt REALLY disappoint: beat earnings on a non-GAAP basis and had 45% annual top line growth.

But that‚Äôs not even the kicker for me. The fact that PLTR leadership is essentially guaranteeing at least 30% growth over the next 5 years (read the earnings call transcript), which will look like an absolute bonanza if rates actually start to go up.

Now, the thesis is that growth firms‚Äô future profits are less valuable today if rates start to go up, which would not be great for big growth names like PLTR. But then here‚Äôs the thing: it would absolutely WRECK mega tech growth like FAANG or the EV/battery state field.

Let‚Äôs go back to earnings. Karp and the PLTR team are essentially setting the bar very low, telling investors to sit back and expect ONLY 30% growth for 5+ years. (For boomers, they realize this is fucking crazy btw).

Essentially, if there is any surprise to the upside, which is totally reasonable with a disruptor like Palantir, and this thing will be worth hundreds of billions in the blink of an eye.

But think of how all these great stories came about. Tesla in 2017-2019. Facebook in 2012-2013. Apple in 2008-2009. These tech stars never had a straight shot up, and the same goes for PLTR.

They faced the same problems. I‚Äôm only a college student, but I remember for as long as I have been alive from skeptical financial analysts that Tesla was gargantually overvalued and didn‚Äôt have the cash to survive in the EV market.

I watched as a kid as some whiz built up a social media platform from his dorm room, but Wall St attacked him for wearing a hoodie to his IPO. Not only did they not think he could expand his platform from PC to mobile, but they questioned how its cutting edge technology differed from Myspace and Tumblr, and wondered if he could ever scale ad revenue. 
He shore could.

Yes, PLTR is overvalued. What isn‚Äôt? Snowflake trades for 80X estimated sales. C3.AI trades at 73.5X its 2020 revenues. Salesforce, Splunk, and MSFT ain‚Äôt cheap. 

(For reference, PLTR is trading just under 37X 2021 sales, which is lofty, but looks reasonable compared to these other names that have way higher multiples and much less sophisticated/scalable software).

And if we look at it... PLTR was profitable by roughly $0.06/share if you take out a stockholder compensation expense that otherwise would have left them with $100M+ in operating profit. 

Is it profitable? PLTR has 70% fucking margins. How are Finance pricks not creaming over this??? You want high margin/earnings- this is it right here, man.

But no, no, big bad overvalued Palantir want to pay executives/advisors/shareholders extra money. Bad. Bad- I say they worth $20 in equity research reports and on CNBC instead, but still load up behind the scenes ü§Æü§°.

Fuck the shills who say Palantir can‚Äôt continue robust growth or be profitable. (I am looking at your trend-seeking bots Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley).

On top of that, yes their revenue base is dominated by gov‚Äôt clients at roughly 52%, but let‚Äôs pause and realize this is a good thing. I mean... i don‚Äôt want to get too political here, but broadly, you‚Äôre a fool if you think the Dod, DoJ, or CDC/NIAID are cutting back anytime soon, if not looking to HEAVILY EXPAND given the monumental threats we face- geopolitical foes like China, Russia Iran; climate change; police reform; EV adoption/renewables more broadly; 5G and cloud/quantum computing, i really could keep going (amongst all of them, these agencies have dozens of contracts with PLTR worth hundreds of millions of $).

Not too mention PLTR also has massive contracts with numerous EU members and Asian allies like Japan/S. korea, but there‚Äôs honestly so many positive examples about how scalable this beauty is both domestically and internationally.

And let‚Äôs take what Cathie Wood said the other day on CNBC: roughly along the lines that some of the greatest innovations come from the military. I think we can point to the WWW as a pretty decent example of that.

Given PLTR traces its roots to the CIA‚Äôs venture capital arm and loading up on national security contracts with all the intelligence agencies after 9/11, I feel pretty confident that this lengthy history will continue providing much value in revenue AND earnings to PLTR, especially if rates starts to rise.

Furthermore, the cross that bogged Tesla, Apple, FB, and pretty much every mega cap tech company is restraining Palantir right now. The Street wonders if they will be able to continue locking down corporate clients, which it has been rapidly expanding in recent years.

The answer is yes. But Wall St doesn‚Äôt want you to think so at the moment. B/c PLTR was a direct listing, they weren‚Äôt underwritten by investment banks, and thus don‚Äôt receive the same financial shilling that names like Snowflake or C3.AI LITERALLY PAY FEES TO analysts/associates at bulge bracket banks to shill like a damn used ‚Äò98 Honda Accord (and that‚Äôs exactly what these other SAaS names are compared to PLTR)

But we always double down on our convictions. If you have seen Palantir‚Äôs demos, read its financials, or listened to their CEO, then you know the potential of this company.

I believe in people. I believe in Peter Thiel and his track record. I believe a guy who founded PayPal with Elon Musk, seeded Facebook when no one else would, and decided to seed PLTR w/ the CIA (when no one else would)- yes, I believe he knows what he is doing.

And I believe he is capable of finding talent like Alex Karp and collaborating with him to build an absolute behemoth.

As a conclusion, can someone give me a firm answer on a company that can actually compete with PLTR in terms of solving a complex issue like tracking down Osama Bin Laden or expanding a niche industry into international markets??? And if your only comment is on valuations, see Snowflake (quite the value investment Mr. Buffett ;).

For disclosure, I am very long PLTR and am simply sharing my thoughts. This is not financial advice. And as always, do your own reading/research, but these are the frank sentiments of a PLTR believer.

Now with the lock-up fucking history, PLTR TO THE MOON üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

2021-03-09 20:03:50,Roblox $RBLX direct listing - some half ass DD,"I‚Äôm thinking of going all in on Roblox tomorrow morning, so I‚Äôm doing my DD as I type this up.

Roblox made $923.9 million of revenue last year 2020 - but reported a loss of $253.3 million....

Roblox is NOT currently profitable.

Paying the Roblox content creators 30% of revenue is $277.17 million (almost what they posted as loss, which is fishy), but leaves $696.73 million of revenue.

So let‚Äôs try to figure out Operating Expenses...

7 executives according to https://corp.roblox.com/people/ - whom are reportedly very well compensated. But I think the website is out of date, or skimmed on purpose - I‚Äôm a tech infrastructure guy and I know of Dan Williams hired at Roblox in 2017 (moving from Dropbox, before that Facebook) to tackle their infrastructure issues - https://corp.roblox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TechCrunch-Ron-Miller-How-Roblox-Completely-Transformed-its-Tech-Stack.pdf More on him and the infrastructure later.

So this site says that they are up to 26 executives- https://craft.co/roblox/executives

Ok, let‚Äôs low ball at $3 million a year each exec (unknown bonuses) (https://fintechzoom.com/fintech_news_roblox/heres-how-much-robloxs-executives-and-cofounders-make/ ) minus $78 million = $618.73 million revenue.

They currently have 960 employees. https://www.barrons.com/articles/roblox-sets-date-to-go-public-through-a-direct-listing-51614036401

953 non exec employees. Some are in China, some make more than others. Majority have a Silicon Valley engineering salary, benefits + perks - let‚Äôs estimate and say those 953 employees average a cost of $300k a year. That‚Äôs another $285.9 million in employee wages, leaves us with $332.83 million left of the revenue for 2020.

$332.83 million estimated left in revenue plus the reported $253.3 million reported loss for 2020 is still $586.13 million left to cover.

Data Center + migration costs. Back to Dan Williams. His purpose was to reduce the infrastructure costs by moving everything they could off of AWS and Windows servers. AWS cloud provider costs + running everything on Windows servers with a cost of license per server - is fucking expensive. My best guess and hope for investing is that this cost is what got rolled up into the $253.3 million reported loss for 2020. This meant setting up 5+ year contracts with Data Center and POP co-location providers (point of presence, where the Comcast, Verizon, etc ISPs hand off their internet traffic). Roblox wouldn‚Äôt have the FB type cash to build their own data centers, so you are talking about $30k a month lease per site. At least 8x Data Centers in the US with 1-3 POPs per DC. ~24 contracts at $30k a month = $8.64 million a year. Similar costs in China, maybe - I dunno the network layout there or how things go with dealing with Chinese government, hence the deal with Tencent.
The cost for populating these Data Centers and POPs with hardware, and performing the migration is the upfront expensive part. Buying the server hardware, buying the network equipment - paying for your own network transit instead of leasing from AWS. Heavy upfront costs, but much much cheaper in the long run than AWS bills.

But I cannot figure anything that would add up to $586.13 million, even if they were giving blank checks and made subpar deals with vars and vendors where everyone got a very hefty cut to make things happen fast and smooth. I also don‚Äôt know what existing contracts they might have had to break / pay off to go the route that would be best going forward.
I‚Äôm gonna rough estimate $150 million on infrastructure equipment and another $150 million on contracts and vendor costs. $586.13 million minus that very rough $300 million brings me down to ~$286 million of costs unaccounted for (again, almost their reported loss - still fishy).

And I doubt they have been able to move all of their services off of AWS - which means they still pay AWS bills, and depending on what services those are - they could be hefty bills.
I do know that if Roblox had planned better from the start - they wouldn‚Äôt even be going public. Optimized servers and back end code on free Linux distos, even running on a cloud provider - would be profitable with their volume. Look at Steam...

So, long term:
Roblox has almost 300 open job positions https://corp.roblox.com/careers/ between US and China. They are pushing hard to expand into China through a ownership partnership with Tencent (look them up if you are not into gaming). They are actively working to right the ship and they have hired high level executives and engineers who have past experience producing results for other Fortune 100 companies.

I spent this time to look into things I was questionable about and still the $253 million loss on ~$1 billion revenue. I didn‚Äôt fully answer my own questions, but got a reasonable explanation for myself.

I‚Äôm not selling my GME or rest of my folio to go RBLX - but I am going to go in with what I‚Äôve got tomorrow am. I‚Äôm a high risk, short term profit guy - so that‚Äôs I‚Äôm betting on. But this could still be the direct listing IPO that tanks after opening. After looking deeper into the rockstars on the Roblox team, and typing all this shit up on mobile - I like the upside.",168,0.9

2021-03-06 09:09:09,$BB üçá,"Some non professional head turning news and speculative figures that don't allow for the proper analytical price targets on this undervalued stock.

First of all BlackBerry has been through quite a number of deals within the last two years. Let's list some of these key partners and deals that have been made with said companies.

1. Baidu
2. Amazon
3. Facebook
4. Huawei
5. Google
6. Nearly every tier 1 automotive manufacturer (research brands yourself)
7. Motional

But aside from these listed driving forces that will provide slowly increasing revenue within the next quarters along with the mission critical equipment they are already installed in. I specifically want to point out why you can't put a logical price target on BB today.

Three deals in particular.

1. The Huawei deal containing the sale of 90 phone patents not only shows a key pivotal point for BB going all in on software and successfully selling overhanging assets, but also this deal remains undisclosed giving us no solid analysis but instead are left with speculation on the price of this deal with a company that has very deep pockets.üöÄ
2. The Facebook lawsuit is one that I have monitored since the filling. Not only was BlackBerry looking for payment for damages from the loss of their BBM platform to Messenger using it's stolen IP. But they also were never looking for a cash payout but instead they were seeking royalties. This deal remains undisclosed leaving us with no real idea of the possibilities within this deal except that once again Facebook is massive and so was the adoption of FB messenger.üöÄ
3. Last but not least the deal with Amazon. This deal has a lot of speculation ranging from BlackBerry's already created asset management tracking devices as well as the possibilities of it's QnX operating system. They could leverage the asset tracker as well as the QnX platform for driverless delivery services and also drone delivery services because it will likely be required to run on a mission critical platform. Once again this deal is undisclosed.üöÄ

So that's a little DD about why the price targets are not positioned correctly for this company. You cannot fairly put a analysis target on a company off of 3 massive undisclosed deals.

\*\*\*If anyone needs more catalyst here is another one. The Ford Sync4 system will be installed in all 2021 Ford Mach E's, 2021 Ford Bronco's and most importantly will be installed in all 2021 Ford F150's which is globally the best selling pickup.\*\*\*

Its quite simple. The HF's overplayed their hand, and they got caught.  So bad in fact, that they are DESPERATE to unwind their positions at any and all costs.    


There are 8 million people in this sub now.  Imagine if each one of us sent a complain to the SEC.  How on earth could they ignore us?  My opinion is that we have not done enough campaigning of our own to educate people about what is going on.  Of course all of WSB is familiar with the blatant manipulation, how about your FB friends? How about Twitter? Stocktwits? Other investing forums? That journalist you went to school with? We all have a voice and we NEED to use it.  

We are being owned in the media, and they are controlling OUR narrative.  All people are hearing is that a bunch of punks on WSB bought a bunch of shitty companies making the stock rise and they are all going to loose their money, cause another financial crash, and kill your 401k.  Is that what we did here? Or did we discovery that some HF's fucked up so badly due their ungodly greed that they themselves risked blowing up the ENTIRE financial institution (again) and are breaking every law conceivable trying to bail themselves out?  

That's the message that all 8 million of us should be spreading right now.  I full expect each and every one of you to write to the SEC about what is happening.  The HF's may have the money, but we have the voice!

# Ghosts of Christmas Past

**Chapter 1: Crypto (2017-18)**

How it all started... I threw every last dollar I had in ETH at $12 and swing traded a ton of shit coins and ICOs until it all came crashing down.

In short: turned $8K into $300K and back to $30k but owed the IRS \~$120K since all the gains were calculated at 2017-year-end. I royally fucked myself because I didn't set any money aside for taxes. Ended up in debt to some very bad people and things were very dark, I don't like to talk about this time in my life that much.

**Chapter 2: WSB Tuition (2018)**

First learned about WSB in 2018 from the infamous FB [ER put play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/922gtp/facebooks_put_play_from_yesterday_im_20_time_to/) by /u/YungBillionaire turning \~$28K into $451K overnight. That sounded fun.

Quickly learned about options but most importantly about FDs, tendies, and the power of memes.

Back then it was all about trade wars and hanging at the whim of commander cheeto's supple tweets.

I have fond memories of:

* Apparently the first stock I ever bought on Robinhood was [HMNY](https://imgur.com/a/2AsrVQB)... thanks Robinhood Recap for the reminder of my retarded-ness
* Grew my first set of winkles on my smooth brain with AMC calls. The thesis was that their Stubs A-List subscription was doing pretty well according to /r/AMCsAList back then
* Went all-in MTCH weekly puts with $12K clenching my stomach in the fetal position when all of a sudden there was a [lawsuit](https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2018/08/14/match-group-faces-2b-lawsuit-from-tinder-co.html) and I tripled my account in minutes, pure luck

Still ended up losing $30K and swore off options forever... until 2020 where I lost another $10k in options. Fucking weeklies man, they're like if cocaine and blackjack made a dopamine-infused baby

# Ghosts of Christmas Present

**Chapter 3: Road to $1M+ (2020)**

Let's start with the receipts since that's what everyone's interested in:

[Proof that I started Feb 2020 with only $35K](https://preview.redd.it/u17ezkgm5i761.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&s=c43b917b12aed8a84b30a43f329020b5def45e39)

Vanguard is my 401k provider and their self-directed brokerage is provided by TD Ameritrade which is why you see screenshots from two different apps. Started the year with $11K in 401k, deposited $26K more in Jan and then started trading in Feb with $35K. The $49K withdrawal in June was for a 401k loan to buy a Tesla.

[Looking at this all-time graph gets me so hard](https://preview.redd.it/vufh3f4b3c761.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f708f141f1c9177f212aa271e443eab5be3fd18)

In my first run up to June, turned $35k into $850K (APT, CODX, NCLH, CHWY) and decided my luck was too good and needed to ""cool down"". Decided to withdraw $50k for a Tesla and stayed away from the markets for a good 3 months thinking the market was going to go back down again...

But it didn't, the market kept rallying and I got the tendie tingles. My first move in Sept was to go all-in on WORK and bought at the high of $35 and was immediately down -30% thanks to their shit ER. They recovered a bit in the weeks afterwards and then jumped into CRSR which made me a millionaire and then GME. GME also shit the bed with a -20% ER but recovered swiftly thanks to Lord Cohen and recently jumped into STIC for that final spike up.

**Chapter 4: Explaining every trade**

[Proof of every gain\/loss I've ever traded \(except APT history which was in Vanguard\)](https://preview.redd.it/mheen4rd3c761.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=504af2cd40b63d276fb42bb83c11bc85c6c1e18f)

My strategy is going all-in on a single stock all-shares. The idea is to have a thesis and conviction with that trade. I stay in the trade until the thesis is invalidated or another opportunity arises, it's a simple strategy and it's worked for me so far. My account does not allow options or margin trading.

Here's a few theses and history I remember in hopes folks can learn something:

* **APT/CODX** \- It was obvious to me in Jan/Feb that this coronavirus was the real deal. The trick was to look at the facts and not the noise. There was a fake [viral video](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/times-fact-check/news/fact-check-are-these-wuhan-residents-screaming-and-begging-for-their-lives/articleshow/74062839.cms) of blood-curdling screams from Wuhan apartments that was so obviously fake but western media loved it. On the other hand, Wuhan built a makeshift hospital in just [10 days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Sh7hghljuQ), that's real action the government took and showed me how seriously dangerous this new virus was going to be. So I loaded up on APT, a mask stock, and rode it up and then switched to CODX, a testing stock, and rode that up from $11 to $24 selling right before their botched ER (conf call with no queue and everyone talking over each other lol)
* **NCLH** \- Saw a curious spike in volume on May 14 with a move upward, piqued my tendie tingles again. Decided it was worth an all-in at $10.57 as the support of $10 was pretty strong. The mood at the time was that coronavirus was waning (I knew it was wrong but the market was emotionally optimistic) and fortunately it caused NCLH to moon and I sold at $19.75 on June 4 even though it kept mooning to $26 over the next 2 days
* **CHWY** \- Got a dog, it's cute. Pets + E-Commerce during a pandemic, easy money. Bought at $41 and sold at $46 only because I thought it was moving kind of slowly. Well I was pretty wrong, now it's at $104
* **SQQQ/TVIX** \- I tried being a gay bear for an hour and lost money. Don't ever be a gay bear
* **CRSR** \- Been watching a ton of tech review and PC building YouTube channels and subreddits and the ""enthusiast"" crowd is definitely larger and has bigger wallets than people think. There is fucking [keyboard typing ASMR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6gW18XE6EM) now and ebay reviewers THANKING scalpers for charging them 2-3x MRSP. Biggest generational jump in GPU and CPU in a while and recently IPO-ed Corsair was definitely gonna benefit from this new generation of gamers was my thesis. Went all-in at $24 and sold at $36 after a non-stop run even though it kept running all the way to $51. No regrets, profit is profit.
* **WORK** \- It was the only ""WFH"" stock that didn't moon yet, thought it deserved a chance was my thesis. Went all-in at the tippy top of $35 on Sept 2 and it immediately kept crashing all the way to $24 in 5 days. Fortunately it recovered a bit and sold at $32 for a loss since I gave up hope and it seemed to be running out of steam

**Chapter 5: GME Gang Confession**

Now: I have a confession to make. My conviction for the Gamestop MOASS is insane. Had 88,233 shares at $13.04 buy-in with a $120 stop limit. Listening to this [90-min podcast](https://anchor.fm/modernguilt/episodes/EP27--NEXT-STOP--GAMESTOP-MOON-BASE-ensdq6) of /u/Uberkikz11 going on about how he knows more about this company than any mortal human should gets me so friken hard every time.

But. That -20% ER drop hurt me on a spiritual level. Watching my account go from $1.5M to $1.1M at one point gave me Taco Bell-levels of stomach cramps.

So when it bounced back to $15-16 on no news on Fri, Dec 18, I felt like I needed to ""cool down"" again. It was going into the holidays with a British virus mutation on the way and hedge funds [manipulating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMShFx5rThI) to get their holiday bonuses, it felt kind of dangerous. And no way Ryan Cohen would be working with his lawyers on something that fast over the holidays, right?

So I sold all my GME at $15.50.

Then on Mon, Dec 21 morning, Lord Cohen drops his new 13D/A... but the stock price stayed flat all day. The Lord gave me a chance. A whole day to get back in. Unfortunately I didn't take it.

And then Tue, Dec 22 all tendies broke loose, the squeezening. +25% gain. /u/deepfuckingvalue dropping his massive dong in another update. I waddled back and forth in my fetal position. Missed out on \~$300K gain while watching everyone freak out. Felt exactly like this:

[Can't feel my dick at all...](https://preview.redd.it/gn74i1yg3c761.jpg?width=460&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c1a7031f8528f949a6d409f045ca727298e7312)

**Chapter 6: Barking on a STIC**

While waddling and scrolling on my phone, I happened to stumble across [this post](https://removeddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kih8z3/the_next_meme_hot_pick_for_all_the_good_boy/) about STIC and BarkBox. Not sure why /u/pound_salt_ deleted the original post but at the time, it was the only post about it on WSB

I was pretty familiar with BarkBox and started researching, it seemed super un-discovered. I liked what I saw: Pets. E-commerce. Subscription. SPAC. Basic white bitches spoiling dogs. This might be worth an all-in.

So on Wed, Dec 23 morning I decided to make a move. All-in at $14.42.

Then I started writing everything I had learned and posted it all in my DD post at 1:46PM ET because I thought it was worth sharing what I found [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kiypqq/sir\_jack\_a\_lots\_next\_move\_all\_in\_stic\_bark\_merger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kiypqq/sir_jack_a_lots_next_move_all_in_stic_bark_merger/)

The price was $14.25 at the time of posting and frankly, price was oddly flat at $14.25 pretty much all day. Lots of people got to buy in at this price. Why did it take me so long to write it? I had actual work meetings all morning and wrote it during my lunch break

Then by the luck of the gods, apparently the CEO of BarkBox, Matt Meeker, went onto [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/12/23/bark-to-go-public.html) at 3:20PM ET and it started mooning. On Thurs, Dec 24 I awoke to a 20% pop and shared my gains for ya'll to salivate over. Complete. Luck.

# Ghost of Christmas Future

**Chapter 7: What's next?**

Let me be clear. I stand by every word of conviction I mentioned in all my GME and STIC posts, those are still my favorite H1 2021 plays. Holding STIC until merger would most definitely get you some massive gains.

But I'm a swing momentum trader. If I feel like something is running out of steam, has a risk of a rug pull, or another stock has potential to pick up steam with lesser downside, that's when I usually jump around.

I'm not happy with just a +25% in 3 months. I want a +25% compounded on +25% compounded on another +25% in the same 3 month time period.

On Monday, Dec 28 I will probably sell STIC and move all into CRSR again. From technical charting perspective, I'm loving the setup and the [magical crayons](https://imgur.com/a/PxlN2em) are telling me we're at the support again and this should bounce in anticipation of strong Q4 earnings.

Now: this is not a ding on STIC or GME, I stand by my 2x-10x claims at some point in H1 2021. It will eventually get there but it might also dip and rise again and I want to swing that dip and rise.

Let me spell it out for some retards: because STIC moon-ed so fast, I want to sell to capture profits and hopefully buy back in on a dip. If STIC had not mooned yet, I would still be holding STIC for a more gradual moon-ing to let my thesis play out. If STIC does not dip but keeps mooning, then I will not chase and happily watch other diamond hands enjoy their tendies.

# Q&A / AMAA

I'm fucking tired of answering the same repeated idiotic questions. Let this Q&A serve as an artifact and please link it to new retards. I will also proceed to debunk every single fucking false claim I've read in my last few posts. Also feel free to AMAA in the comments, I'll be replying all day.

1. **How often do you jack off?** At least 2 times a day and always before I make a trade for that post-nut clarity
2. **Haha you're going to owe so much in taxes** \- Nope, this is all in my 401k which in the US means I don't owe taxes until I withdraw. Fucking compounding gains for years bitch
3. **Why are you making such risky trades?** My goal is 8 digits or bust, that's my /r/fatfire number so I can finally quit this wageslave game. It's so obviously stacked against us and requires a lottery moment to reach escape velocity to play on New Game+ where I can live on $400k 4% SWR on $10M. This is my lottery moment and I'm leaning all the fucking way in. That's why I'm chad-ing it up and trying to TIME the market, meaning riding shit up and then jumping back into shit for another ride up. Fuck you Warren Buffet and your 90 y/o ""time in the market"" boomer bullshit. The next pandemic in 2025 might wipe us all out anyways, I ain't got time to wait for retirement. Gotta will it into existence. YOLO
4. **How are you so good at this?** I study everything. Technicals. Charts. Support levels. Volume spikes. Short interest. Executive teams. Rumors. Customer sentiment. Employee morale. Insider trading. MSM manipulation. Comparable market caps. ER reports. Upgrade reports. SEC filings. Meme potential. I literally watch and study every facet I can about a company, and do so quickly.
5. **What's your trading strategy?** All-in on a single stock all-shares. The idea is to have a thesis and conviction with that trade. I stay in the trade until the thesis is invalidated or another opportunity arises, it's a simple strategy and it's worked for me so far.
6. **Why do you post on WSB?** Internet points is fucking fun. I was banned for like 30 minutes  yesterday (on ""accident"" apparently) and having $200k+ gains without the ability to share was just not the same
7. **How do I follow your next move?** Oh just follow my discord/newslett -- no fuck that shit. I don't do discord or newsletters or twitter or anything else. I'll keep posting on WSB until 8 digits or bust (or ban), you can guarantee that.
8. **Why do you remove the time on your screenshots?** I'm cropping shit on my iPhone and my username is between the portfolio number and the top bar. Otherwise I'd love to friken show off my perpetual 69% battery level
9. **15% isn't a real YOLO** \- I am literally shoving my entire net worth into a single stock every single time. Correct it's not the same as blackjack or FDs where if I got it wrong, I could lose everything but it's still fucking riskier than any ETF or financial advisor with their cuckold MBA would ever advise. One 15% play may not be impressive but compounded together is how you get this 50X in less than a year
10. **Where's PLTR or TSLA?** Notice I never once touched PLTR, TSLA, NIO, XBEV, MVIS, etc or any of the other meme stocks WSB loves. That's because I hate being a sheep and following after the curve. I try to find shit *right* before the curve starts (usually indicated by a volume spike) and most WSB meme stocks are up way too high for my risk tolerance. Too much at stake to lose to a random rug pull moment.
11. **Hey I think I'm your cousin, can I get some money?** No you fuck, [stop being poor](https://i.redd.it/eyj4re61ibe21.jpg).
12. **Hey do you wanna fuck my ex-wife?** Already did, next
13. **You're just using WSB to pump and dump on us** \- No you fucking idiot.

* **First:** look at my [post history](https://www.reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/posts/), I NEVER make a hard recommendation for people to buy a stock. I only share my gains, losses, or DD because it's fucking funny to see how ya'll react. Whether people want to follow my move or not is 100% up to people. Do your own fucking DD and figure out when you want to sell according to your own thesis/risk tolerance.
* **Second**: You folks keep asking me for my next move. Well how and when the fuck should I share it? If I post something in the morning, it's stuck in /new for a while until it gets enough upvotes to hit the front page and by then it's already afternoon or market close and the stock might have already done who knows what. That's not pump and dumping, that's just a delayed effect of how Reddit's algorithm works. Anything on the front page is essentially 5-15 hours old news and you need to determine if the state of the world is still the same or be a sheep and chase. It's the same thing once you hear Aunt Cathie or Boomer Cramer mention a stock and it trickles down to you, you're chasing after others have already gotten in
* **Third:** My $1.5M is not enough to move any real-volume stock. I don't touch OTC or low-volume shit. For STIC: I have 97K shares and on average 2-4M shares are traded every day for STIC so my account is a like a drop of whale cum in the ocean
* **Fourth:** Real pump and dumpers are the shitty scum on the earth. Spend any time in /r/pennystocks or some Discord or Stocktwits and holy shit, these scum run fucking operations. I've even seen paid newsletters where the highest tier gets the tip ""early"" to buy in and then the lower/free tiers get the tip which causes the pump for the early buyers to literally dump on and create bag holders on non-existant volume too
* **Fifth:** Listen to what /u/DoubleKillGG and his big brain figured out the rest of you retards could not:

>The fact is that SIR\_JACK\_A\_LOT is a swing trader. Yes he pumps his stocks and closes relatively quickly but he doesn't pump shit stocks. If you bought any of his positions when he posted you'd be up on everything. A pump and dump requires the dump part where investors are left holding a stock that is worth less than when they bought it. He did, however, break wsb's rule #4; STIC's market cap is below $1B.

2021-01-16 04:18:05,$PLTR - The Big DDD," I don't get what you guys are worried about with PLTR.

Here's my **personal** DD on PLTR, you're welcome to read and do whatever you want. Other helpful info or pointing out mistakes in my DD is very welcome.

Fears preventing you from buying PLTR

1. Targeted ads on your phone from Yahoo Finance or Zacks telling you PLTR = BAD!!!1!eleven
2. Shills spamming ""pLtR tO tHe MoOn"" and :rocket: on PLTR thread comments.
3. Last quarter's seemingly bad financials/earnings.
4. Financials Moving Forwards
5. Soros who owns 21 million shares ""threatening"" to sell his shares upon DPO expiry.
6. DPO expiry 3 days after February's earnings and possible insiders and DPO holders sale and dip.
7. What does PLTR tldr.
8. Other Information

&#x200B;

***#1 Targeted Ads***

Ads and articles are both paid for by someone.The fact that in the past 3 weeks i've been getting multiple multiple targeted ads on my phone related to PLTR since i love PLTR so much.

Ads are telling me that PLTR is bad, doesn't provide a dividend, they're telling me PLTR's fair price is 20 instead of 25 based on some financial model and have gone as far as to provide a list of alternative stocks to buy.

To me, this all screams: **SCARE TACTICS**

Additionally, the last few weeks of ups and downs in PLTR's stock price is another indication of the attempts to short the stock to sh!t and drive investors out. (For what reason? I don't know.)

&#x200B;

***#2 Shilling PLTR***

I myself love to shill PLTR to people whenever i can. I do this because i legitimately think this company will do great. I work as a product manager in a software development house and understand what PLTR does. PLTR is not cryptic.Regardless, i think when people shill PLTR to you, they are right to do so as you're probably missing out on a great opportunity to make money in the long run. If you're looking for big gains short term, maybe try something else.

Shillery is OK, but at least give the facts.

&#x200B;

***#3 Last Quarter's Bad Financials***

If you'd done your DD not by searching reddit posts but by checking PLTR's actual quarterly report, you'd know that PLTR's ""bad"" last financial quarter/earnings were due to the costs of listing themselves on the *New York Stock Exchange*.\~855million were spent on listing and stock related compensations and this is the big reason.

**Direct quote by PLTR here:** [https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx)

>We incurred a loss from operations of $847.8 million, which includes $847.0 million in stock-based compensation following our recent direct listing.

I would like to remind everyone that this is a **1 TIME THING.** Put simply, this means that PLTR won't have as excessive losses next quarter as they did this last quarter.

*Additionally*, let me go into further detail on this and not just leave it to that.

* ***PLTR's quarterly operating expenses for the past 3 quarters were at around \~260 million.***
* ***PLTR's operating expenses this quarter were \~987 million.***

ADDITIONALLY...

PLTR also had a higher R&D cost this quarter that just passed. Normally they'd pay 80 million on R&D, but somehow ended up paying \~300 million this quarter. No one knows why, but this is another thing that influenced PLTR's earnings.

[https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx)

>On September 30, 2020, in connection with the Direct Listing, we incurred $769.5 million and $8.4 million of stock-based compensation using the accelerated attribution method related to the satisfaction of the performance-based vesting condition for RSUs and growth units, respectively, that had satisfied the service-based vesting condition as of such date.

&#x200B;

***#4 PLTR financials moving forwards***

PLTR is deep in bed with the government and the Biden regime although may look like it would be against using PLTR is in fact secretly very pro-surveillance e.g pro Palantir.

Here's some of the known organizations in the US Govt that use PLTR:

1. CDC
2. Office of the Secretary
3. Food and Drug Administration
4. Immigration and Customs Enforcements / ICE
5. Internal Revenue Service / IRS
6. National Institute on Drug Abuse
7. DOD/ARMY - ACC Aberdeen Proving Ground
8. Coast Guard / DHS
9. DOD/NAVY - Naval Information Warfare Systems Command
10. US Attorney's Offices / DOJ
11. US Special Operations Command / SPEC OPS

Boys. The big institutional people know these things. You just found this out. See how deep PLTR is already in bed with the Government?????? Palantir IS the next Raytheon/Lockheed of DATA aggregation and visualization.

***UPCOMING EARNINGS***

I've done some quick maths and it looks like PLTR is more likely to be in positive earnings this quarter and with a 0.02 cent EPS target, we can easily assume that they'll destroy this with maybe 0.04 or 0.08 EPS. In the worst case scenario, PLTR's EPS this quarter could be somewhere around MINUS -0.05 ish due to interview costs and ad/campaigning costs that were not there before the company was listed.

***WHAT CAN DESTROY PALANTIR***

Now, there's big possible downsides and Palantir can fail IF contracts that expire are not renewed. That's biggest REAL reason for Palantir's balance sheet getting screwed.

I've seen a disturbing pattern with PLTR's financials and that's that every year, it's R&D cost is rising by between 150 and 350 million dollars. This is quite a bit of negative revenue and if new contracts are not constantly coming in, PLTR's balance can start going into the negative.

***WHAT WILL NOT DESTROY PALANTIR***

Some people may have concerns over the new left leaning government dumping PLTR. An article was posted that is behind a paywall EVERYWHERE that goes something like this:

[https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-officials-urge-biden-team-to-dump-palantirs-covid-tracker](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-officials-urge-biden-team-to-dump-palantirs-covid-tracker)

In my opinion, i believe this is inconsequential and that a few people crying to daddy Biden to kill a multimillion contract with PLTR is a stretch. Also we know the current new Biden team has his hands full and will have them full for at least the next 1 year with what's going on.

There is no time to deal with a few crybabies and even if he did deal with it and did decide to kill the PLTR Tiberius Covid tracker contract with the CDC which he WONT, these things take months and years to deal with, and by then the contract/s will have already brought PLTR tons of money and revenue in.

***HOW MUCH DOES KARP AND HIS GOONS GET PAID***

Short answer is... A LOT. The amounts below are PER YEAR. That's a lot of money in the hole and contributes to annoying amount to why PLTR is always just at the edge of just barely being profitable.

https://preview.redd.it/ba58nqcurob61.png?width=2615&format=png&auto=webp&s=55d45833faad4d60ea8dc142a9601c44b4cc7395

Palantir's prospectus 311 page document's 130 last pages are almost all exclusively talking about extremely complicated options trading schemes that are made by Cohen and others to make sure they can squeeze out a LOT of money out of PLTR.

Mithril Investments has existed from before and is not a new company. Owned by Thiel/Cohen/Karp as a way to launder and exchange options for more options and more money for all 3 of them. Also Shyam Sankar to me feels corrupt which scares me a bit, he's had some very shady dealings and has brought his wife in PLTR that gets paid 200k per year.

Prospectus Document: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm)

I suggest you skim through it, it contains EVERYTHING about Palantir.

**Palantir is going to need to have to be getting AT LEAST 500 million in NEW contracts per year to REMAIN BARELY profitable. It's doable in my opinion, but just barely and it's why they made the company public to try and get more people's attention and increase the inflow of contracts.**

&#x200B;

***#5 Soros and his 21 million shares***

First of all, i think we can all agree that Soros can suck it.

If you've read a few articles here and there, you'll know that Soros owns/owned 1% of Class A PLTR shares. No one knows whether he's sold them yet or if he's an DPO holder who'll sell 3 days after February's earnings.

Whether he sells them or buys more will be mostly inconsequential in my opinion. We see dips and pumps every day. He legally cannot sell his shares all at once, he'll have to sell certain amounts daily and over time. This will create annoying sideways motion as shares exchange hands and consolidation starts for 2-3 weeks until his and insider shares exchange hands.

Nothing special to see here, move along just a little draw down resulting in some consolidation.

PLTR is exposed to OIL more than anything, so fluctuations in the general market and general market crashes affect PLTR much less than other stocks. Also PLTR does not track ANY benchmarks. NONE.

&#x200B;

***#6 DPO expiry 3 days after earnings in February***

To my limited knowledge, this is how BIG plays who are holding DPO shares usually work:

* If a stock has performed well up to earnings and investors are more than happy with the returns, they're more likely to not sell their stock or just sell less than they normally would.
* If a stock hasn't performed as well as investors thought, these investors are more likely to sell stock or reduce their positions more than normal.

There's a total of 1.16Billion Class A PLTR shares currently (Give or take don't flog me). We are currently trading with \~250 million shares while the rest are locked away in the DPO.

When those shares are ""unlocked"" in February, the price of the stock won't be diluted. These shares already exist and are accounted for. They are simply locked. Also when they are unlocked, the share price won't simply multiply because all shares are now tradeable.

>According to [Palantir‚Äôs after-hours filing with the SEC this afternoon](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520257973/d89036dex991.htm), the company has 1.16 billion Class A shares, 484 million Class B shares and 1 million Class F shares on its cap table outstanding today, or a total of roughly 1.64 billion. Only Class A shares will trade, and Class B and F shares are convertible to Class A shares on a one-to-one basis. On a fully diluted basis, which Palantir says represents 2.2 billion shares total according to its most recent S-1 filing, the company is valued at $16 billion. The difference between those two aggregate numbers comes from outstanding stock performance grants, warrants and other financial instruments.

What **WILL** affect stock price:

* Employees exercising their non class A options into Class A shares. This IS dilution.
* The bigwigs e.g Alex Karp, Peter Thiel and a few other bigshots exercising their options and then selling them for a profit.

*To note, regular employees will barely affect the price of the stock with their miniscule share holdings. Alex Karp, Peter Thiel and a handful of other high ranked executives in PLTR are the ones that will create a tiny but manageable ripple in the stock price.*

What **COULD** affect the stock price a lot:

* Massive sell off by the big institutional holders.
* Not shorters. (Citron and Citi can suck it, we're in control here)
* People with weak spaghetti wet paper hands.
* Everyone fomoing the same weeklies e.g like when everyone bought Jan 15 calls on everything.
* Big but silent scare campaign (that's already going on) to scare off normies like us.

&#x200B;

***#7 What does PLTR do, tldr.***

Imagine Facebook's database of everything about everyone & Youtube's Database of everything & Geolocation data in a database made by the US Army for known terrorist cells.

Palantir allows you to select and match varied data TYPES from several different database, combine it in any way you want and visualize it so that it's human readable by even the dumbest person in the room so that even they can see patterns and come to conclusion on a subject matter.

It's kind of like filling an excel sheet with data and then visualizing it with a bar chart, except the date you filled the sheet with can be anything and not just numbers or dates or countries and you can make various combinations using all the different rows of data to maybe come up with a pattern to something like how to best distribute the Covid vaccines in the counties in a very specific state in the US.

Literally what you see in SciFi movies where people combine random data by smashing keys on a keyboard and somehow find the murderer, the location of a terrorist or the percentage that someone will commit a murder in the future based on a lot of random data about that person or the area, country, family, history... anything.

While this all might sound super cool and amazing, it is. Maybe in 10 years time there will be a few more companies doing this, but for now, it's only Palantir, Circles, Alteryx and a few other private entities that do this type of thing. Many of them work with governments and are hush hush due to the kinds of things they use this type of software for (terrorist cells, warzones, etc) and the public backlash this could cause.

tldr: Glorified data aggregator and visualization platform/software with different access levels for different people.

**PLTR is superbly positioned to offer their software to SLOW and Boomer like organizations like Governments.**

Governments are stupid and don't have neither the time, nor technical knowledge to develop this software themselves for internal use. This is what PLTR capitalizes on and why Governments use them so much.

Governments could have spent the a fraction of the money they spend on PLTR contracts to make the software themselves but only for their own internal systems and use, but they can't and if they tried, they'd fail because technocracy in governments is not a thing. By the time they'd even complete a project like this, it'd likely be out of spec, unusable and would require further development and money and we know how slow and bad governments are at doing even the basics. Again PLTR wins because of this.

**PLTR is likely NOT** to be adopted by giants like Google or FB or other modern tech organizations of any size because they are not stupid. They have their own purpose built internal systems that they use to do everything related to data aggregation and visualization because they have the technical knowledge and resources. Buying PLTR for their use is a joke.

PLTR capitalizes on being general a general purpose tool and is set up manually by an engineer over the course of 4-10 days for each customer. The engineer customizes and configures the system for each company's custom use since the software allows you to do so. Regular aggregation and visualization software CAN do the same, but typically lacks data input types and features that PLTR has because PLTR has cultivated a special set of features over many years that were suggested by their existing clientele in battlefields and other places.

>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to award a contract without providing for full and open competition to Palantir Technologies, Inc., 100 Hamilton Ave., Suite 300, Palo Alto, CA 94301.

Veteran Health Association - **WON**

>The pandemic-related data management and operational decision-support requirements have led the program office to determine that the Palantir data management and analytics platform is the only viable solution that would maintain the current operational capability, without a degradation in VHA COVID-19 decision-support.

AFLCMC Wright Patterson AFB (DOD - USAF - AFMC - AFLCMC) - **LOST**

>Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) held meetings in January/February 2020 timeframe with potential vendors to determine their capabilities and their abilities to meet this mission requirement. They met with Palantir, Recorded Future, Altyrex, In-Q-tel and Semantic AI. From the information they gathered in those meetings it was determined that Semantic AI would be the only company that could fully meet the requirements of this effort without further delaying the project and incurring additional costs

Now friends, here's my position on PLTR. I'll be holding onto it for the next year. If it's not at least 300% by then, i'm selling it and moving on to the next stock. App i'm using is Revolut.

Also yes, i'm ALL-IN only on Palantir because i know my money will multiply itself in the short term. I'm not holding this till 2025 as others are supposedly doing. I'm selling in 2022 with 300% or more profit. PLTR is severely undervalued, underpriced because it's a DPO. Give it till EOY and we're going to be rich. If it was an IPO it'd be trading at 180+ already imho.

I've spent the last month and a half holding PLTR. I've gone full schizzo mode when it comes to PLTR. I lose sleep daily and i love it. I hadn't slept for 37 hours a few days ago because i spent so much time researching PLTR and scraping the internet for all possible information.

I come from an IT/Development background, so i understand what PLTR does completely.

My PT's for PLTR are:

* 48-89 by March or April.
* 75 - 125 by EOY.
* 200+ 2022 IF they solve their income and constantly increasing R&D cost issues.

Short Facebook and Twitter as soon as you can.,"Facebook is being sued by the ftc and all 50 states for being a monopoly. they are receiving digital taxes from multiple countries, and they are facing huge backlash over the recent censorship. The same is happening to Twitter as well. There are also a lot more serious implications that both CEO‚Äôs are tied into that I‚Äôm not going to discuss further. I‚Äôve got FB 210p for 2/19 and Twitter 36p 3/19. Zuckerberg has been massively selling shares for the past month, to the tune of hundreds of millions worth of shares sold.

2021-02-24 18:09:30,[DD] The War of Giants: Apple soon to open an ad delivery platform.,"TL;DR: Apple will soon introduce a quality over quantity ad platform that will demolish all existing ad platforms.

Fundamental explanation of what blocking tracking actually means: 
https://www.techrepublic.com/article/safari-for-ios-14-and-macos-11-how-to-prevent-websites-from-tracking-your-moves-online/

Signs that desire for early adoption is high: 
https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/prevent-apps-from-tracking-you-across-sites-ios/

Apples self-claimed results:
https://searchads.apple.com/

ios14 is proclaimed to fuck small businesses, marketers and e-commerce. That is the single biggest Zoomer and Millennial workforce collective in America. With this change, businesses can no longer target any iPhone user after they‚Äôve visited their website while using the trigger of the ad that they visited the website.

Ie, you visit a red shoe page. You forget about it. Tomorrow you see an ad for a red shoe.

Or, you look at concerts online in Austin. Then you get distracted and don‚Äôt do anything. And then you get an ad for a discount to a concert the next time you‚Äôre browsing.

No more ads like that with ios14. That is dangerous because 80% of the digital marketing budget is devoted to remarketing and retargeting efforts (across the entire industry)

So, that‚Äôs concerning to me because while we can convert customers that have visited the website of Our company and that knows who we are, we make 9.7x what we spend on ads. But, with raw new first time interaction we see a return of .43x. This update will essentially fuck all the small businesses that have put in the time to build their marketing structure around Facebook, and even more so removes the ability for e-commerce to use this as their primary driving factor as e-commerce has an even worse initial introduction return but retargeting they make bank.

Simply put, all ads have to be written like you have no idea who exactly you‚Äôre talking to beyond a few details of their interests. You lose all ability to check if they are interested or even know about your company based off non-Facebook interactions. With this, Facebook interactions aren‚Äôt even valid anymore due to their far right audience consuming a 76% majority of their usage, you result in clients that are legit fucked. So you have to limit your buyer persona a ton and in turn your average ad cost will be raised significantly as it has for the last year as costs have eclipsed an all time high of being ~400% higher than last year.

All in all, you‚Äôd now spend $15000 for the same thing you would‚Äôve paid $900 for previously (unless you‚Äôre part of the .00001% of FB advertisers). Due to the increased costs of Facebooks bottom line but also because of all these other factors combining to make it harder to even find the person you want, much less be given the time needed to convince them.

While tracking isn‚Äôt the nail in the coffin, the further downsides of Facebook remove further value. This isn‚Äôt about Facebook though. This is to show that Apple is making an incredibly, multi-industry impacting move with an attempt to bring Facebook to a 0% market share of iPhone users.

Why the fuck would Apple do this? They would never hurt their brand. They would never make a dumb money decision. They are the biggest company on the NYSE and that didn‚Äôt happen by making off the cuff decisions nor did that happen because of a ‚Äúprivacy play‚Äù Apple has realistically taken as much of the market as they can while touting privacy as their primary benefit to buy an iPhone.

With this Facebook filed an antitrust lawsuit that is literally going to create a War Between Giants. This very well may be the single largest business brawl ever seen. The number one most valuable company in America that‚Äôs geared to fight the number four most valuable.

What does that mean? Well typically, Apple will stay hush-hush since they aren‚Äôt making the move for publicity or branding. That‚Äôs not what happened this time. Instead, as soon as Apple was asked for a comment they stated they‚Äôd be fighting it.

Following this, Facebook sends out an email at 3:00am talking about the impacts this will have on all Facebook advertisers. They were burning the midnight oil and they decided fear was the best way to motivate the Facebook advertisers. Fuck Facebook for that tbh.

Well, Facebook has a secret solution. They can basically bundle an internet browser into Facebook and just serve the ads through there. Suddenly, they can track you again because suddenly you are never technically leaving Facebook. This is sketchy as fuck and is a simple one-line fix for Apple to again remove this ability. Like a game of cat and mouse as Apple plugs Facebooks bullshit side skirt attempts.

Additionally, Apple doesn‚Äôt historically allow skirts as you can see in the most recent time Apple denied a product that competed with a market they are in: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2020/6/18/21296180/apple-hey-email-app-basecamp-rejection-response-controversy-antitrust-regulation and this move was super controversial. 

Want another example? Maybe a high profile one? Well Apple said fuck Epic Games and went for the jugular when they straight up removed Fortnite and all Epic Games products from the App Store. They straight up murdered another billion dollar company and Apple didn‚Äôt even get scratched. Literally said ‚Äúfuck off, you can come back when you will pay your bill‚Äù

Apple didn‚Äôt care. They were going to get their money whether the company or retail investors cared. Apple is going to get paid when you‚Äôre on their platform.

But currently Facebook pays Apple $100 a year to list their app. That‚Äôs it. They don‚Äôt get a cut of ad share. Nothing. So Apple can monetize these small companies making millions but can‚Äôt take a cent from the fourth largest company in America. That‚Äôs not something they‚Äôre gonna be chill about especially as Facebook continues to damage their own reputation. You‚Äôve seen Apple swing once with ios14 and you‚Äôll soon see Apple swing with punch two.

But before punch two could even happen, Facebook files an anti-trust lawsuit and tries convincing their advertises with that 3am email to support the lawsuit. Uh oh. Must be hot in the walls of Facebook.

So why would Apple finally pull the trigger?

Because for years they‚Äôve been building a secret digital marketing ad delivery platform. Where‚Äôs it been tested? In the App Store and they are currently sitting at a 50% conversion rate on average. That means one of two people that see an ad, download the app from that ad.

That is fucking crazy numbers as Homeer is currently sitting at 3%. That‚Äôs a  16x difference. That means we could theoretically pay 16x less due to the difference in their ad delivery model or potentially see 16x the amount of impressions.

What‚Äôs the difference that makes Apple so different? They don‚Äôt want to spend your whole budget unless they‚Äôve found the perfect person. With Apple, you can set a maximum budget of $10,000 a month currently. Facebook currently has small e-commerce shops spending multi-millions a month. In the App Store, there is a ton of money left on the table currently but that‚Äôs not the juicy bit here. The juicy bit is that for the last years they‚Äôve been testing and building this platform while also updating all user experience with Apple products. Finally, Apple has reached 100% control of the apps found and used on their phone, but what they don‚Äôt control is the ads inside those apps.

The five obvious big plays here.

üëâ Mobile game ads

Game ads have become a meme about how bad they are. Additionally, they are essentially the very last item that can give Apple a bad look while also largely deceiving the users of iPhones. You know how bad they are. An additional upside to this is that not only does Apple look better as a whole, but this is before you consider that suddenly small businesses would have access to an even deeper level of targeting.

Imagine now, I know my perfect client is 34, has two kids and plays candy crush before she goes to bed. Well finally I can run ads under that scenario without having to go through some shady venue while also maintaining the trust aspect.

üëâ Ads for kids

Finally parents can prevent their kids from seeing unregulated ads. Honestly, I can‚Äôt give example of revenue benefits here but this does help early adoption and public support a fuck ton.

üëâ Safe for work toggle

Finally, we can have not safe for work ads for those that opt-in. Alternatively, this would function as SFW only but this is again, just another public perception possibility.

üëâ Apple News 

Now, Apple has been going hard after news apps for the last year. Why would they do this? Because they have Apple News but it‚Äôs not monetized by Apple currently. Again, they have third party providers displaying ads that Apple gets zero share of.

But oh don‚Äôt worry, soon Apple will finally monetize all of their software because they have ads running in every platform imaginable.

üëâ Privacy

Another major benefit is that we can deliver high quality ads as business, will get better ads as consumers all while maintaining the fine line of quality and privacy.

Now, ignoring all of that, Apple has seen a moving average growth of 50% YoY for the last four years. They have a solid growth path with products and for the last two years they‚Äôve built their cloud platform to not only consume massive amounts of data, but also process that data. Just look at how they can now search through all of your photos instantly and show you them instantly without a single bit of that photo data being physically on your phone. They are geared to the fucking tits on software innovation and no one even cares.

To put it in perspective, Apple introducing an ad delivery platform with 50% avg. conversion rate would be like the day Steve Jobs announced the first iPhone.

Secretly for years they‚Äôve worked towards this moment and they finally swung first in a fight.

Even without ads I fully expect them to hit the target of $165 by the end of the year while reaching $220 safely at the end of 2023.

Realistically, business adoption will take at least 8 months before Apple sees enough profit to even recoup the cost of the lawsuit, but this would be the single largest business pivot ever seen in the world.

So if Apple goes from a product business to a software business what does that mean for their value? Let‚Äôs look at Stripe since we have recent data and we know what they‚Äôre doing has the same kind of user life-changing benefits.

Stripe does $450 million in revenue. They were just valued at $115 billion. That‚Äôs a P/E ratio of 255%

Currently, the P/E ratio of Apple is 34% so not only do I expect them to land in the high middle range of the two, I also additionally expect never before seen returns for an ad company. Not because they have the largest audience but because they can genuinely show your ad to the exact person you want.

From a business perspective, digital marketing is entirely about quality over quantity when it comes to potential consumer eyes and this would be the very first ad platform to operate with this ideal.

Finally, Apple is currently underperforming and is trading on rumor of a bullshit electric car and is sliding, all while literally no one on the internet has considered the idea that they‚Äôre doing all this because they‚Äôre introducing an ad platform that will soon print billions of profit within months of releasing.

Now finally we can cover the aspect that we don‚Äôt have to try and time them developing and releasing this. They already tested it, got crazy fucking results and no one bats an eye. Everyone is so consumed by Facebook they totally missed the play Apple just made.

There‚Äôs a major war brewing and it‚Äôs only begun. But we‚Äôve all watched the idea that all media is good media be proven true as Robinhood received 3.5 billion in funding during the biggest retail investor controversy in modern day. Regardless initial interaction, Apple investors don‚Äôt get scared by that. Apple investors are Apple investors because they know they will bring hell to earth before they accept not getting a cut of the money.

This company is down on the month incredibly and there has never been a better time to buy Apple IMO while being prepared to hold for about 8 months for potentially a massive, massive payout. This is not an option we will sell quickly. This is a weather the storm and wait for the announcement to set into reality.

Disclaimer that this is pure personal intuition and this idea came from nowhere but my ass and Facebook sent the email literally Monday so this is as hot off the press it can be.

All this to say, people like targeted marketing both businesses and consumers but not when it‚Äôs in Facebook hands. 

What company in the entire market is most trusted to do right by the consumer while delivering an incredible cost at likely a higher cost to those paying while also maintaining 100% of their self-made market? Apple.

Edit: due to an awesome fucking user we now know they are hiring a massive amount of jobs for their ad platforms: https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/search?search=Client%20Partner%20Manager-%20Search%20Ads&amp;sort=relevance&amp;location=united-states-USA

2021-02-11 12:14:27,PLTR DD - Earnings Play - Why This time is Different,"\*not financial advice.

PLTR is an amazing opportunity rn. I did a DD on here for Nio when it was around  $39. Today was a bad day and we're still over 60. It doesn't make me more credible per se, but hear me out. 

I'm a catalyst trader. I go in before huge events. PLTR has an upcoming catalyst, and a compelling reason for the stonk price to be super high in the lead up to earnings.

**Catalyst:** PLTR's earnings is scheduled before market on Tuesday, 16th. 

**I. What happened before?**   
1) On November 12, PLTR's Q3 earnings was a whopping +125% surprise. Stonk prices skyrocked in the following weeks.   


2) On January 26, PLTR had a Live Demo Day. The stonk prices went from 26 to 39 leading up to Demo day, and then all the way up to 45 after Demo Day.   


**Thesis:** PLTR's scheduled events tend to pump the stonk prices in the build up and in the aftermath as well.  


**II. Earnings are volatile. Why play this one?**   
**A) Incentives:**  
PLTR's share lockout expiration happens days after earnings. Better earnings, equals better stonk prices, equals a better payout for those with the stock options. It's much more logical to pump the price up (legally through enthusiasm, etc) because the expiration will tank the price anyway, even if it's the bottom. 

I was offered share options from a startup once and understand the psychology of how this works. Imagine waiting for years to have your shares worth something, secondly, imagine owning tens-of-thousands of shares that you could just sell and become an overnight millionaire. If you never had a million dollars before, you wouldn't really care about timing the sale tbh, unless you're DFV (I don't think he works for PLTR). So the lockout expiration will very likely lead to a temporary selloff.  


**B) IV**  
The IV for PLTR is high. If you buy calls, buy leaps. I'm buying calls because I'm an autist. But if you wanna play it safe, do something else. Like play iron condor. Or just sell puts. Or ignore IV, buy shares, sell calls at the top. You'll have to time the top during/after earnings, but sell before the IV Crush. You could literally go about this in so many different ways and still make money.   


**C) Solid Performance and Partnerships**  
IBM, Rio Tinto, Cathie Wood's addition of shares, Blackrock's increase of shares, and a potential Facebook partnership. To be honest, the FB partnership rumor is probably fake, but, there was promise of another announcement near earnings. 

**TLDR -** I don't normally play earnings, but PLTR seems like a great play rn with many different opportunities.   
I apologize if I'm wrong about an earnings beat. I'm not a psychic. But I believe in the long term--this guy's going to 100+. So buy leaps and shares.",333,0.91
2021-01-10 21:48:24,I have a discount trading bot which gives out daily (well hourly discounts for the stock market). Here‚Äôs what the bot stated under discounted companies...,"I wasn‚Äôt sure which flair to use.

As the title says I have a trading bot which I spent a long while developing.

There are two batches of codes which I run alongside each other.

Batch 1 and Batch 2.

Batch 1 uses some of the judgement of myself and calculations to gather stock.

Batch 2 is just purely calculations which release values which say if it‚Äôs worth doing a call, or not worth doing a call.

Past few days the top picks with NVDA, and a small cap  I can post this daily if you guys are interested.

This the data which I have acquired on Sunday (NY) 10th of January 2021, based on the close of the last business day.

Here‚Äôs an update to my trading bot. QS looks tempting but I think I can hold off until tomorrow a better company I understand comes on sight.

Only invest in companies you know and have a understanding of and can see they have a future, to lessen any potential losses via trading.

&#x200B;

**Key:**

* Pharma companies are very risky.
* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.
* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.
* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).
* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.
* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.
* Take the ""Calls"" as very discounted, and ""Potentially A Call"" as somewhat discounted.
* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.
* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.
* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.

Edit 1: there might be companies which you haven‚Äôt heard of, this is due to me adding the SPY 500 companies into it to increase data output.

EDIT 2: I‚Äôm not charging anyone for this data and no you cannot buy it - I worked too hard to get it right. I‚Äôll be giving daily updates for it.

2021-02-22 07:37:41,Today is the day to do your job with PLTR,"I‚Äôve been on this thread nonstop lately, advocating (don‚Äôt sue me ;)) y‚Äôall to get into this bad boy. The fundamentals are all there: a cutting edge tech unicorn with robust sales, earnings on deck, and unparalleled potential.

The ownership from institutions is otw as well. We all know Cathie Wood has tripled down in the last week, and recently, big banks like JP Morgan are confirming previous stakes in PLTR.

This is FB/GOOG in the waiting, but I believe it will soar like Tesla. Indeed, the monetary policy conditions right now are extremely conducive to mega cap tech companies getting grounded EXTREMELY FAST, see this provoking WSJ graphic on the topic 

(https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-tesla-made-it-to-the-winners-circle-11613739634?st=pkrws73wwocvyo8&reflink=article_imessage_share)

I think PLTR‚Äôs days in the $20 range are numbered. One can hem about valuations all day, but tell me why obsolete Snowflake is trading at 80X sales, and we can have an intelligent discussion.

If we (the market not WSB) believe Tesla, Snowflake, and Shopify are not a joke, than PLTR is grossly UNDERVALUED. I have to imagine smart money isn‚Äôt too far behind my thinking.",247,0.84

2021-03-09 23:35:02,Roblox IPO on 3/10 (tomorrow): My analysis of its sell target,"One of the most exciting IPOs this year is coming tomorrow morning - Roblox. This is a company with a strong founder/CEO, huge network effect & ecosystem MOAT, a large and attractive young user base that could propel it to become the next ""Facebook,"" and, for those who appreciate healthy fundamentals, strong and steady topline revenue growth as well as positive cash flows.

Roblox will open at $45, based on its recently fundraising round valuing it at $29.5B.

I believe that its fair stock price (sell target) is $80. Below is my quick analysis:

\- The average first day gain of tech IPOs in 2020 was 82%. That would value Roblox at **\~$82/share.**

\- Here's something unique about Roblox's financials. **While its revenue in 2020 was $924 millions, its 2020 revenue bookings, which contributed to its actual cash flows from users who bought a lot of Rubux, was double that at $1.9 billions.** Further, while the company didn't report a profit, **it had a very positive free cash flow of $524 million** due to its high $1.9 billion of booking. This reminds me of Amazon's beautiful model of free cash flows which propelled its rocket growth over the year despite seeming unprofitability.

\- Given Roblox's unique high billing compared to its revenue, **I decided to take the average of its revenue and billing (Average of $924M and $1.9Bn = $1.4Bn) to apply comparable companies' multiples to.**

\- **Its closest comparable companies are Unity and Facebook (at the time of IPO in 2012).** Unity is trading at 36x trailing 12 month revenue but had negative cash flow with a much less attractive business model. Facebook, another company built on strong network effects, traded at \~28x trailing 12 month revenue and 100x its trailing 12 months earnings at its IPO in 2012.

\- If I apply Facebook's 100x TTM earnings multiple to Roblox's $524M free cash flow in 2020, I get \~$52Bn of market cap or **\~$80 in stock price. Facebook, at the time of its IPO, traded at >220x trailing 12 month free cash flow.** Unity had negative free cash flows in 2020. Hence, one could argue that the 100x free cash flow multiple is reasonable if not conservative.

\- If I apply 36x TTM revenue multiple from Unity today to the average of Roblox's revenue and billing at $1.4Bn, I got \~$50Bn in market cap, **or $77 in stock price.** If I apply FB's 28x at its time of IPO, the stock price would be \~$60 but the market also generally traded at lower multiples back in 2012 plus Facebook's valuation grew tremendously after IPO, **so Unity's revenue multiple is more applicable for today's market.**

**Highs:**

**- Strong founder CEO:** David Baszucki is one of the most visionary founder CEOs with both solid leadership chops and a strong product vision.

**- Huge network effect and ecosystem MOAT:** Roblox has a beautiful business model, a hybrid of subscription and marketplace. The ecosystem it has created over a long time has a highly defendable MOAT. Fueled by strong cash flows, the company is also continually investing in its ecosystem.

**- A large captivated young user base - an envy for Facebook + opportunities for international growth opportunities:** If you are hunting for the next Facebook, it will never look like Facebook. Half of the kids in the US are on Roblox and it's rapidly expanding internationally! Zuckerberg is constantly paranoid about losing the next generation. Here comes Roblox!

**- Potentially huge advertising revenue opportunities.** Roblox is still at the early stages of exploring advertising revenue opportunities given its huge attractive user base. This can be huge.

**Risk:**

**- COVID's fading:** As COVID fades, people may go outside and spend less time gaming. However, looking at Roblox' steady YoY growth even before COVID, it seems that COVID was simply an accelerator but not a game changer.",72,0.87

**April 2020** \- Long story short, I started in April 2020 right after COVID, whereby I got introduced to some 'gurus'/paid courses to learn basic options strategies. Bought calls on everything tech, FB, AMD, SE, NVDA, PTON, FSLY, etc, etc. Started to find that ""money was so easy to make"" and even took out bank loans.

**August 2020** \- Indices rally all day everyday, stonks only go up, earnings always beat and stonks rally, made $175k in only 3/4 months.

**September 2020** \- Crashed hard for 3 days, and due to poor risk management with absolutely ZERO take profit / stop losses, watched ALL my tech calls bleed into oblivion. Profit got wiped out and I was literally back at breakeven. Wasted 4/5 months of my time, had no job, and was in debt. Went into semi-depression.

**October 2020** \- Figured I had to find get my money back, all I needed was just ONE good play to go all-in, and I would recover. Or at least that's what I told myself. Found this guy NoProblemChanging who seemed to be really accurate at predicting the markets - literally followed the advice of a stranger on WSB and went all in on puts due to his bearish views and certainty that the market was going to crash.

**November 2020** \- As we all know, everyone was expecting elections to be a shitshow but vaccine news rallied the markets with multiple gap ups and stuff. **By now I was already down $100k and was depressed. Imagine having made easy money ($175k in 4 months) in the greatest bull market of all time, only to lose it all in 3 days and even going negative, while seeing every stonk around me go up everyday while my puts bled all day. Not going to lie, at this moment I felt like $ROPEing although logically I know $100k is money that can still be earned back.**

I was so desperate at this moment that I HAD to find something that I could ALL IN and GUARANTEED to make money. Then, I found $GME. I found u/DeepFuckingValue and that's when I climbed into the rabbit hole, knowing it was a fundamentally undervalued company. Bought around $15\~. Huge credit to GMEShortSqueeze and u/Uberkikz11 as well.

**December 2020** \- By this time, I was pretty much already all in $GME but I hedged with CCs / sold some of my calls WAY TOO EARLY. **To put it into perspective, if I didn't touch my positions at all until today, I would have been around $3m, but as of now I'm only around $1.4m. Regardless, I am grateful!**

**January 2021** \- I've joined the 2 comma club officially! Finally hit my milestone.

**TLDR; made easy money on the rally after COVID in 4 months, lost it all in 3 days due to poor risk management and even went negative, briefly experienced depression and felt like $ROPEing, found a good company $GME, went all in with conviction, emerged stronger than ever.  üíéüôå  üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ  üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ  If I can do it, so can you.**

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/16/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-16-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Stock futures mixed after Dow, S&P 500 closed at record highs again

> * U.S. stock futures were mixed Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 little changed after they both closed again at record highs to start the week. Nasdaq futures rose Tuesday, adding to Monday‚Äôs 1.1% gain, which moved the tech-heavy index to just 4.5% away from last month‚Äôs record high close.

> * Stocks were able to shake off the 10-year Treasury yield holding around 1.6% on Monday and Tuesday, after hitting an over one-year high of 1.642% on Friday. Rapidly rising bond yields have recently been a drag on growth stocks as higher interest rates erode the value of future profits and compress market valuations.

*****

> # 2. Fed to begin March meeting with polices under scrutiny

> * The Federal Reserve, which begins its two-day March meeting Tuesday, will be watching bond yields and the latest reading on retail sales. Economists expect the government‚Äôs February data to show a 0.4% increase in retail sales following a 5.3% surge in January. With the Fed‚Äôs extraordinarily easy monetary measures during Covid under scrutiny, the nation‚Äôs central bank is set to release new economic and interest rate forecasts along with its policy statement Wednesday afternoon.

*****

> # 3. Moderna studies Covid vaccine in kids; more countries halt AstraZeneca

> * Moderna has started testing its Covid vaccine in children ranging in age from six months to less than 12 years old. The mid-to-late stage study intends to enroll about 6,750 kids in the U.S. and Canada. In a separate study, which began in December, Moderna is also testing its vaccine in adolescents between 12 and 18 years old. The two-shot vaccine has already been authorized for emergency use in Americans 18 and older.

> * Sweden and Latvia on Tuesday joined a fast-growing list of European nations suspending use of AstraZeneca‚Äôs Covid vaccine as health regulators proceed with a new review into its side effects after reports of blood clots. Germany, France, Italy and Spain on Monday said they would all stop administering it. However, the World Health Organization and Europe‚Äôs drug regulator have recommended that countries continue to use AstraZeneca‚Äôs two-shot regimen.

*****

> # 4. Regulators investigating ‚Äòviolent‚Äô Tesla crash; Autopilot not ruled out yet

> * The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating what it calls ‚Äúviolent‚Äù crash involving a Tesla sedan and a tractor trailer last week in Detroit. Authorities have not yet said whether the electric car maker‚Äôs Autopilot, Full Self-Driving or FSD beta may have contributed to the accident. The NHTSA has previously embarked on probes into more than a dozen crashes that were thought to involve Tesla‚Äôs advanced driver assist systems.

*****

> # 5. OxyContin maker Purdue proposes $10 billion plan to exit bankruptcy

> * OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma is proposing a $10 billion plan to emerge from bankruptcy protection. Those efforts would include a significant boost, more than $4 billion, from members of the Sackler family who own the Connecticut-based company. Court documents show Purdue officials continued to push to maintain sales of OxyContin even as it became clear the drug was being abused. Complicated litigation is playing out in courts across the country in efforts to hold the drug industry accountable for the nation‚Äôs opioid crisis.

&#x200B;

BB is looking good for a couple reasons.

1. Rumor of settled lawsuits with FB in BB's favor. Should have details within two weeks.
2. BB just sold phone patents to Huwawei. This frees them from their smartphone burdens and gives more capital for their EBIT.
3. BB's CEO just signed a deal where he gets massive $$ if share prices hit $16,$20, and $30.

 She paid a total of around $105,000 for this trade. At one point her position was down more than 70% in January last year!

How much is that position worth today? I did some quick backtesting in Thinkorswim to find out and those call options are now worth a cool **78.25 ($7,820)**

It looks like she did not have any secret info from her powerful friends before the huge correction in 2018 (she bought RIGHT before the dip) but she still came out on top anyway by having IRON HANDS and buying long dated LEAPS! 

Judging by her past actions she will most likely exercise these options and keep the shares of Facebook for now.

2021-01-15 18:08:34,Unusual Options Activity 101: Whale Watching Tips,"This is long, if you‚Äôre uninterested skip to the ten tips list or TLDR

A while ago I started mixing unusual options activity into my ~~gambling~~investing.  At first I lost a shitload of money chasing dumbass whales with zero plan, but now I actually have a pretty good feel for it.  I still fuck up alot, but more often I do not fuck up.  This is to help those of you who want to start chasing whales, or are at a basic level and want to do it better.

I'm using some plays from this week as examples because they are fresh in my mind and I have a couple screenshots.

**Tools**
I use barchart in tandem with Unusual Whales. For barchart, you can honestly get by using their free version, you just can't sort as well.  They have a free month trial too.  I also pay the 20 bucks for Unusual Whales to confirm what I scan, and they have a good stocks volume standard deviation tool.  I have zero affiliation to either, just saying what I use.

There are way more technical ways to do this, but I like to use my eyes to scan sporadically throughout the day like a boomer.

**Basic Concept**
Long story short, you're ideally chasing the options purchases of what are, presumably, deep-pocketed individuals or institutions.  UOA identifies certain options contract orders that are higher than the average daily contract order.  For example, if the average daily option volume on an GME weekly is 4,000, and an option order enters for 4,000 or higher, it's flagged as unusual activity since it's a multiple of that daily average volume--sometimes it shows as multiple orders if ""they"" push through a few smaller purchases that produce heavy volume.

MM are sneks who like to move in silence, which they can do with with stock positions via dark pools and the like.  However, they can't get away with that with options activity--it all shows.  That fact, young autist, is your slingshot against the institutional goliath.

**Hunting the Whale**
So I've got my unusual options activity page open on barchart or wherever for the current day.  I adjust the expiration date option so that the options I'm looking at don't expire past a couple weeks out (more on why later), then I'm ready to eye scan.

I typically start by looking for **one of two things: 1) large clusters of orders that belong to one ticker  or 2) sporadic orders for a ticker that consistently show up over a couple hours, but belong to non-hot, non-meme stonks that do NOT have earnings imminent.**  To make sure I'm looking at something potentially weird, I choose to exclude options that expire more than a couple weeks out.

**1) Clusters of orders‚ÄîABNB example**
The way I scope it is kind of a tiered process.  *First*, I'm looking to see if there are any clusters of orders that catch my eye on a quick scan.  *Second*, I'm looking to see if those clusters of orders contain both calls AND puts, with some OTM activity and spreads preferred.  *Third*, I look to see if the number of seperate call orders outweighs the number of put orders (or vice versa), and additionally I look to see if the volume of the calls drastically outweighs the volume of the puts (or vice versa).  

**Why?  Because it helps you determine if the options order is just a hedge, or if it‚Äôs hedging against itself as it‚Äôs own positio**n. This is super important so try to follow along-- most UOA is just institutions hedging; Mr. MM has a nice, busy life and fancy yacht and can't just exit his positions back and forth all day like a WSBer.  He also has like a billion shares of his stonks, so if he dumps it when he's got paper hands it will siginficantly tank the value and cause a ripple effect.  So, *instead* of hedging by dumping his shit, he hedges by adding OTM options against his position--next level fucking diamond hands.  That would be the type of whale order from Mr. MM we don't want to follow.  *But*, if Mr. MM buys 4,000 FB call options in a few blocks, and you see like 1,000 in FB puts go through right alongside it, the odds are that someone is betting big on FB and using the puts as a hedge, since the puts represent a smaller volume in the call/put ratio.  Instead of the options being a hedge for a bigger stock position they hold, these types of option clusters indicate that the option order itself is the big, independent play, and it's hedging itself with lower volume order vs the higher volume (4,000 calls to 1,000 puts).

**Then I do an easy confirmation**.  I check the tickers general trend the past week or so in a chart, do a news search on twitter of their ticker for news catalysts and sentiment, and google and YouTube to see if the crayola kids think it's a good nerd play.

**Example**: Here's the screenshot on some ABNB UOA I noticed and played this week.  It went to 200% and change within a couple hours, but I had unfortunate diamond hands and sold for about half that.

[ABNB UOA](https://i.imgur.com/mYDXYmN.jpg)

So, this a softball.  **First**, you can see that ABNB all of a sudden explodes with all these options showing up at 12:52‚Äìthat's our cluster.  **Second**, the clusters have both calls and puts in that minute timespan, with some put orders showing at the bottom of the cluster.  Some of the calls are deep OTM, as far as 200c.  **Third**, the call orders far outweigh the put orders in both amount and volume.  *Awwwww shit, looks like we got more than a hedge‚Äîwe‚Äôre onto something.*

**Confirmation time**: ABNB had been on a general uptrend, and I typically don't like to chase, but I combed twitter and saw their were rumors of the CEO speaking the following day, and that news had just broken of their DC booking cancellations.  I looked back into the morning, and saw a few more unusual blocks, and a few more rolled in just after the cluster pictured above.

Passed the smell test.  Options bought, tendies gained.

**Sparse Orders: SNAP example**

The same principles can apply to orders on tickers that pop up individual orders, not large clusters,  which **a) haven‚Äôt had much attention b) have been on a steep downtrend‚Äîthis makes the order unusual, and/or c) seem to keep popping up in single orders over a few hours to a day.**The same principles as above apply, but if you see these types of orders with very little time left until expiration, you can assume assume it's probably not a hedge.  SNAP isn't the best example of the week because there wasn't a put order in this block.  But, there was positive TA sentiment when I searched, SNAP had been on an oversold downtrend, and I don't have screenshots left of the better ones I saw and went after.  **Plus, importantly, IT WAS TOWARDS THE END OF THE DAY** (this is huge, EOD is prime time for AH news whales)

[SNAP UOA](https://i.imgur.com/GGr5bra.jpg)

A better example from this week though is SPCE, which had only a few orders sprinkled throughout the day, and one toward the end of the day which was DEEP, DEEP OTM expiring 1/15.  **That‚Äôs a flag for us‚Äîsporadic listing throughout the day, OTM toward the end of the day. ** BAM! EOD SPCE OTM calls sprinkle in, ARK invests to kick off AH, SPCE moons. 

**Sparse Orders Patterns: Connecting the dots on tech rebound with FB and SNAP**

Seeing the SNAP orders above sharpened my eyes that day to looking for a pattern with tech on the whole, since big tech had been so royally gaped the past week.  I kept seeing FB options like this pop up

[https://i.imgur.com/muVGtq2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/T54peER.jpg)

Sometimes you can put together sporadic listings and create a working theory based on a sector.  Because this and similar FB orders were deep OTM and one day out, I knew there was a risk they could a hedge, but also knew that the tech sector was due for a rebound and saw SNAP posting sporadic OTM as well.  **So, I bought my options for each of those two another week out and closer to ATM (important, more below), to give the whale some breathing room** in case was it was a hedge, even though the technicals agreed with the bounce.  The whales were right, and it was an easy little overnight profit.


**How I‚Äôve Fucked Up 1: Don‚Äôt get tricked by trends**

Although we like to believe institutions are ahead of the curve, often they are just trend-riding lemmings who follow what's already way, way up.  They buy the top, just like WSB tardies such as yourself specialize in.  So, when you see shit like this below, take a minute to think before you get excited:

[NIO UOA LIKE THIS WAS NONSTOP](https://i.imgur.com/JCZBx2s.jpg)

It was the same for all the memes: PLUG, FCEL, MARA, and RIOT all week, dominating the orders.  If something is already too popular, just stay away from it.  You can ride something up, but when you see massive orders on shit that's already like 400% IV, just...don't.

**How I‚Äôve Fucked Up 2: DO give the MM‚Äôs some breathing room**

*Even if you‚Äôre confident in a move you see that is a few days out, extend your play a week or two further out minimum, and strike it closer to ATM.*  If you can't do either of those things because you can't afford the premium just skip that play and check back for something new later; I promise a better opportunity will arise.  You can recover from bagholding, but you cannot recover from blowing your account on an incorrect 0DTE.

Breathing room is also important because often whales will have the news but not the exact timing.  Two months ago I followed a DDOG whale on a Thursday 1DTE that expired worthless the next day.  The following Monday (1 trade day later) DDOG made the announcement that rocketed them like 20%--if I'd given them a week's breathing room, it would've been a 15 bagger.  Fucking F.

**So, to review:** look for order clusters or sporadic ticker orders that a) have a mix of calls and puts with one dominating the other b) unpopular tickers that have deep OTM or close expirations c) always check chatter afterward and fundamentals and d) try to put together a narrative of things that are related that catch your eye (this Monday's EV run or this Friday's tech bounce could be next week's airline dominance or cruiseline craze--connect the dots).  Initially look for options expiring soon, as they indicate the most riskiness--and therefore confidence--if the MM is not hedging.  Shop with a short term eye, buy with a long term choice. 

**10 Things That Will Help You Not GUH:**

**1)** Monday and Friday morning/afternoon are the most accurate whale times, according to data from Unusual Whales

**2)** If you don't have PDT always save some spending power for EOD shopping

**3**) If you don't have PDT never, ever follow a whale with a weekly.  Sometimes the news the whale bets on is a 'sell the news' event, and you won‚Äôt recover from a drop especially if there is IV crush involved. 

**4)** Always give the whale breathing room by purchasing an expiration at least a week further out

**4b**) Always give the whale breathing room by going closer to ATM strikes than theirs

**5)** Sign up for barchart monthly trial (then continue it) and unusual whales--they're each like 20 bucks and thats way less than you spend on an FD. 

**6**) You don't need to learn TA, but you need to check technicals on the tickers you want to chase--almost every major ticker has youtubers or fintwits giving their daily or weekly TA.  This way you know if it's a proper breakout happening if the whale hits, and you're not just guessing at when to take profits.  Remember, whales can buy wayyyyyyy OTM and sell for massive profit at any point--they *aren‚Äôt* bagholding a call until it's in the money like you are. You may be 10% up waiting for the next 80% GME day while your whale has sold at their target 5% profits on the play and is chillin. 

**7**) Leave at least 10% of your account spending power free each day.  I promise, the one time you go full boat you will see the most obvious whale play at the end of the day.  Then you won't be able to do shit about it and you'll hate yourself when it's a 10 bagger overnight.  Trust me.

**8**) Make sure the ticker you're chasing isn't just ER anticipation/bets.  Always check earnings dates before buying.

**9**) Remember whales are people, so they can be stupid, too.  Don't baghold a position that is clearly fucked for some news that looks unlikely to come.  They are gambling addicts just like you, except they have more money.

**10**) Always take profits if you ask yourself if it's time to.  If it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to close the position.

***

TLDR
Use a service to follow whales so you can get ahead of announcements.  Look for clusters of options activity that hedge themselves via call/put ratio, and do a legitimate check for TA and catalysts to confirm their moves.  Never follow a whale into a weekly, but use weeklies are your best screener.

Let's talk FB - that irrelevant social network your grandma posts hydroxychloriquine videos on.

I looked over the last 5 years of ERs - they have only missed EPS 2x and still gapped up both! They Gap on average after earnings 6.1%. Straddles right now are implying a move of 5.8% - its close, but on average will print. When they are up its on average 6%, when FB down - usually (5.3%)

Their biggest GAP Quarters:

\- 2Q18 -stock had ran up considerably despite data leaks, fake news scandals, election interference investigations etc. - had a revenue miss with poor outlook. - Stonk gapped down almost 20% the next morning.

\-4Q15 - after struggling to generate consistent mobile revenues - finally seemed to unlock a revenue stream in mobile - stonk gapped UP 13.5%

\-4Q18 - after selling off 40% from their rough 2018, had a little positive movement and bulls jumped in and stonk gapped UP 10%

There is a lot of consolidation waiting for ER or some earnings to decide which way this is going...

**I personally believe that we are looking at a 2Q18 ER** \- we have lots of negative news from antitrust hearings, to boycotts, to a global depression! yet stonk has ran-up a bit too far with recent ATHs. I think we could fall 10% on a weak outlook or greater impact of small business budget cuts / boycotts to revenues. On the other hand, ecommerce is surging and FB plays a small role here with targeted IG ads and such.

If you want to YOLO and pick 1-direction - **FB usually moves up** after ER (12 out of last 19 - even on a miss) - on average 6% - calls are implying a 3.1% move - if we get an average move after ER - you should make 80% on any of these near the money calls (230-235). if you want to yolo and pick something far OTM like a $250c - then you are hoping for one of the best Qs ever like a 10% move to get similar payout - pretty good chance you lose if you hold, or maybe get a pop on the gap and can exit at a profit.  Last Q they opened up $13 - that would pocked you a 200% gain.

Bears?? **2Q usually is the worse Q**. After a big run-up, ER is usually that catalyst for correction (3q16, 4q17, 2q18) - usually triggers a multi-day bear pattern - may even be able to profit off an 8/7P that is a little

**TLDR** \- if you guess which way this thing is going to move and buy a P/C 8/31 ATM - you will print 200% - chance of it being stagnant is near zero... will it move to justify a straddle??? It's tight moving an average of 6.1% on earnings with a straddle cost of 5.8% - is that enough risk / reward?",5,0.67
2020-06-29 17:10:50,The Case Against FB (Short to Mid Term DD),"tl;dr - short-term FB near money calls (\~$230), September-October puts ($170-$185)

Autists, I present to you this beauty:

[\(yes it's a big one and I took it to the chest as a shareholder\)](https://preview.redd.it/bocbo4icsx751.png?width=1850&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2e3d3764618538d92ff0823438b587cabda3de5)

This is chart showing $FB's stock (two days of trading volume) on the last earnings release (2018 Q2) where they released data showing slowing revenue and user growth. Ouchie!

Some more detailed discussion can be found here: [https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/25/facebook-q2-2018-earnings/](https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/25/facebook-q2-2018-earnings/)

But in short:

* Revenue showed a noticeable decline in growth
* User growth slowed
* **And there were signs that advertisers might start pulling off their platform**

I'm of the opinion that we will see FB's stock have a similar drop in value (not quite as sudden or as quick as this one) through the rest of this year. Why, you say? This is why (taken from their [financials](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2020/q1/Q1-2020-FB-Earnings-Presentation.pdf) from Q1 of this year):

Astute autists will notice that the dark gray is bigger than the light gray.

This is good, you're learning.

Now look again and notice that this observation tells you that FB's revenue isn't diversified at all. Forget Libra coin (not launched yet), Marketplace (outstanding product, but not their cash cow), or user growth. FB DOES NOT MAKE MONEY OUTSIDE OF ADVERTISING. So, all of these companies pulling advertising off of FB's platform is going to hit them right where it hurts. But most importantly: it's going to hit right at their revenue growth story. And even more importantly: when is this spend going to come back? I've been making comments in the daily threads that I think that the ""we don't like FB's content stance"" is just a cover for companies not having to admit that ad spend is going to have a bad ROI in the second half of this year and they don't see the point in paying it. So, how is FB going to talk about that on their Q2 (and Q3) earnings calls? It's certainly going to affect guidance negatively.

All this said, I think there's a good chance this means that ad spend falls to below 2019 Q1 levels at least for US & Canadian users at \~$30 per user (the astute autists who digested the light gray/dark gray bar picture above will see this is also where the highest revenue generating users are for FB).

With a revenue number like this, FB will struggle to produce positive guidance (remember story is important even for the FAGMAN's) which the market has reacted negatively to before (see 1st picture).

2021-03-07 07:54:19,Free Plays for you Smooth-Brained Feces Throwing Apes,"Stop gambling your money with margin on GME and RKT which are almost certain to result in you idiots losing all of your money and play smart instead.

&#x200B;

1. OIL calls / shares -- sell end of summer / beg of fall. Generationally cheap --- with re-opening AND constrained supply due to all of the green initiatives, we should see a major runup of oil prices.
2. FINANCIAL calls, in particular I like WFC due to cheap calls. It was in the 50s before COVID reared its ugly head.
3. BABA - beat down by Xi's cockhammer but still absolutely dominant in China. It's the best undervalued tech name (even better than FB in my opinion). BABA also is heavily invested in the China start-up ecosystem, so should do well even with more-than-expected regulation (which I find unlikely)

**Why I like these plays:**

These plays should do well in all 2021 environments.

* Inflation fears due to overstimulus? Oil and financials will do great while BABA, given how cheap it is, will be flat.
* Inflation fears overblown yet reopening moves forward? All 3 should do extremely well.
* New COVID strain renders current vaccines useless -- BABA will do well and oil/financials will be flat. This is just unlikely to happen, boyz. Even with new variants things will continue to open up.

The only way to lose money is if we have a zombie apocalypse.

&#x200B;

**Positions**

1. WFC:  June 50c or 45c and sold 4/16 puts to pay for the calls. 1000 shares.
2. BABA: 710 shares -- no options as I don't have a good thesis on WHEN it will moon.
3. XOM, OXY, CPE, MRO, MPC -- various shares and options with different strikes from next month through August. Also selling puts to pay for the calls. 200k into it overall.

2021-01-29 13:09:58,"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news (Jan 29, 2021 after market close)","* After a hiatus due to GME craze, reeeeecaps are back for a limited time. The broader market took a nose dive today as volatility resume in earnest due to, of all things, fucking meme stocks. As GME, AMC, KOSS, and others continue their large swings to the stratosphere much to the grief of short sides, chatters are now about that sell-offs are partly a liquidity issue as funds close out their long position to cover (and prevent a margin call) on their decimated short positions in GME et al. VIX continues the spike from Wednesday and was up as high as 19% as systemic risk to the market are now fully in the spotlight.

* During intraday low, the DOW was down as much as -747 pts while SPX was down -94 pts and Chadsdaq was down -352 pts. Almost all sectors are being punished while a few medical products company in SPX escape into the greens due to a strong ER and an overall strengthened demand - cuz there's a fucking global pandemic. TMO is up 2.93% for the day to $511 while DHR is up 4% to $237. Conversely, big tech are big fucked as AAPL, FB, and MSFT are all down significantly. AAPL closed down -3.74%, FB down -2.52%, and MSFT closed down -2.92% (despite a strong ER result earlier in the week). AMZN, GOOGL, and NFLX are all down around -1%.

* GME swings to a strong green opening after RH relents being a shill bag for Citadel, allowing limited GME and AMC trading (to one or five fucking shares? what a joke). Turns out when the product is free, you're the product? In yet another volatile session, intraday high was at the opening $413 and intraday low was at $250 (a 40% intraday move) as MMs clear out their delta and escapes a total gamma squeeze to live yet another day. The short squeeze, however, is still in play as GME closes up 68% to close at $325, thanks to a reversal of movement shortly before power hour. As of writing, short sellers are at mark-to-market loss of almost 20 bil. You gotta feel for them as they might need to downgrade from a super yacht to a pleb boat. Such shame.

* Congress critters, media pundits, and everyone's moms continue to give their 2cents on the GME and gang episode - and while consensus is usually in favor of the little guys, being a cynical F - you should expect regulations and further restrictions from regulators/industry moving forward. One likely curb to help save MMs would be restricting options trading to a certain account size, or further restricting access to 0dte, particularly for volatile underlyings. Expect all this to come out with messaging of ""helping to protect our customers.""

* RoaringKitty AKA DFV gets [nice profile from the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/roaring-kitty-reddit-gamestop-markets.html) and if you are one of the few millions who are new to the story + sub, the piece does a good job giving a history of how DFV got started. Yours truly somehow got quoted in the piece as well and while the quote was decisively retarded as F, no cap it was an accurate description of most of our mindset. (Of all the fucking quotes to pick out from DFV's updates since 2019...). DFV posted his [latest YOLO update](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l846a1/gme_yolo_monthend_update_jan_2021/) minutes after market close. Don't click thru. Guess if he's still in?

* If you're unhappy with your broker due to restrictions, select veteran brokerages such as Fidelity, Vanguard, ETrade, has placed zero restriction (short of whatever that is already existed) on meme stock trading. As it turns out companies with decent corporate value are actually NOT dick bags, even in the face of market volatility. (Sure their UI might be stuck in the 90s and early 2000s). Things are especially helpful as these brokerages do their own clearing and aren't beholden to Citadel and others. While brokers who use Apex as a clearing house has had limited time restriction (Ally, TDA, Tasty etc.) they are definitely far better than whatever RH has done to their customer.

* Notable upgrades and downgrades: Despite receiving a strong upgrades this AM, BA couldn't handle overall macro pressure and its green opening of +2% swung to red as the day chugs on. Morgan Stanley double upgraded Boeing to overweight form underweight with a PT of $230, up from $165. BA closed the day down -1.54% to $194, further contributing to DOW's demise. SFIX, who rode quite a bit of the short squeeze mania in recent days (from $55 to $100 within two weeks) was hit with a downgrade by Baird as they notch the shares down to neutral from outperform with a PT of $85. SFIX closed the day down -4.44% to $95. GM, who's looking more and more likely to be the next strong EV contender receives another PT hike to $80 from $57 by Morgan Stanley. Shares remain unchanged given the recent run-up and closed the day flat at -0.7% to $50.68.

* After a decent rally from ER, AAL immediately sets out to offer another round of 1 bil in stocks, further fucking over their long term boomer shareholders. Already selling 1 bil in stock back in Oct of last year, the new offering will be selling up to 1.12 bil in more. Shares of American Airline close the day down -5% to $17. Others in the sector are also down, particular as UAL warns that thousands of job are at risk again - despite a 15 bil handout from the recent stimulus package. UAL close down -6% to $40, DAL down -5.29% to $38. Meanwhile JBLU and LUV handles the sector news a bit better given their management isn't complete trash.

* In WSB meme stock land, everything is a fucking meme stock now. AMC close the day up 53% back above $13. BB, a stock without the short squeeze factor closed the day down -3.75% to $14. If you like the previous DDs and plays on BB - you can always regrab $15c or $20c leaps when IV has cool down some more after VIX has retreated. As of writing Jan 22 and Jan 23 leaps are still looking at 140-150% IV. Which is a bit too expensive in premium. ICLN retreats yet again, down -3.3%. MT is down -3.8% after running up almost 7% the day before, and PLTR close the day down -1.35% to $35 ish. TSLA took another haircut of -5% to close out at $793, furthering yesterday's decline after an ER profit miss that didn't impress the market. Yeah, you almost forgot about all these tickers, didn't ya?

* Looking for a bullish meme stock play but just can't stomach the IV or premiums level and shares are too boomer (or out of reach in the case of GME lol)? Thanks to crazy high IV, you can join theta gang sell GME puts (cash covered or spread) at strikes of $25p to $35p for April, netting you premium of around $7 to $11. This bakes in one Q4 ER which GME should do well in, and with IV at +400% and delta of under 0.02 and lower (heh), the odds are stacked in your favor to come out ahead of the play. If assigned, you'll be paying only $18 for GME for the 25p and $24 for the 35p. Another company that will likely be a decent hold if assigned: BB puts are also going for decent premium. Feb 19 10p is going for around $1.75 with a delta of 0.2, or you can go further out to March 10p which nets you about $2.5 with a delta of 0.2 as well.

* **Noteworthy ERs:** With most of the big bois ER behind us (and overshadowed by meme stocks), earnings season continues next week with a few more market movers. On Feb 2nd, BABA, PFE, and UPS all reports before market opens. Later that afternoon, AMZN will report after market close. Further along the week, PYPL reports on Feb 3 after market close while PINS reports Feb 4 after market close. (PINS doesn't really move market but its noteworthy enough).

* **Notable econ numbers** includes the usual boys with Monday PMI at 9:45 AM ET, ISM manufacturing index at 10 AM ET, jobless claims on Thursday at 8:30 AM and the big daddy employment situation (nonfarm payroll etc) on Friday at 8:30 AM ET. 

* The DOW closed down -2% or -622 pts, Nasdaq down -2% or -266 pts, SPX down -1.93% or -73 pts, and RUT close down -1.57% or -32 pts.

After a long hiatus (banned for mentioning a SPAC that went from 10 to 60 back to 24, and AMC before it was 1 billion in value). I have returned for the next big opportunity. Honestly there are a few with the recent route in the market, but here is opportunity #1 in my opinion based on technical and internal financial information.

Alibaba ticker BABA: But OP, china risk, and regulation, and it‚Äôs down 26.25% from its high of $317.14! STFU and keep reading:

[Alibaba Group Holding Ltd - ADR (BABA : NYSE) Stock Price & News - Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/BABA:NYSE?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijpci4gZfvAhUaGVkFHT4EDsoQ3ecFMAB6BAgGEBo)

Yup that‚Äôs why I love the company. Alibaba posted better than expected earnings beating on top and bottom with growth YOY 36% yeah that‚Äôs amazing. Because fundamentally nothing has changed. It‚Äôs current P/e is an amazingly low 25.93x yes, a company growing 30% YOY is trading below its growth rate and further the sector average P/e is 49.18x Now I know we are fucking retarded here so based on basic math BABA is valued at half of its competitors. That‚Äôs a buy signal alone as if it can reach the same valuation; get ready: it doubles from this price.

But OP China is going to regulate big Chinese tech! No, China wants to be the leader in tech and can‚Äôt afford to cut the legs from its largest most profitable companies. The recent ‚ÄúNEWS‚Äù on the clamping down of its tech companies is in my opinion noise. Think of it this way: When FB was fined in the EU they fined FB $122 Million dollars. Ouch. (But not really because: day do be rich doh! FB is in a similar BABA spot in the USA I like it too) China‚Äôs fine to Alibaba? 76k [China Fines Alibaba, Tencent Unit Under Anti-Monopoly Laws - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-14/china-fines-alibaba-tencent-for-flouting-rules-in-past-deals) Yeah‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a serious reprimand‚Ä¶ This is classic China manipulation of their publicly traded companies to reduce the price before they rocket higher. They do this very often in the penny stock area of the market. This time they just went bigger. ANT ipo? Still on, they just are requiring higher cash reserves for the lending arm. What does that mean? It means that the loans provided by ANT will have better backing and will be less likely for default. Further ANT deals with digital money and the people‚Äôs republic of china government has already said they are looking to Alibaba to help roll out with a digital yuan. See what‚Äôs going on here? China is publicly reprimanding a company that it is actively working with to bring in the future. [MYbank, backed by Alibaba's Ant Group, joins China's digital yuan pilot (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/mybank-backed-by-alibabas-ant-group-joins-chinas-digital-yuan-pilot.html)

Ignore the noise, ignore the ‚ÄúSmart Money‚Äù they have a time horizon of 2 weeks. We have the time horizon of DIAMONDS!!

My position is 6 BABA 280p sold short at $61 I also have 5 credit spreads 290/300p

TL:DR BABA could double based on its current valuation and the fact that it continues to grow, is picked by government to work on digital currency roll out and its low P/e",25,0.56

2021-01-19 06:40:45,BB DDüöÄüöÄüöÄ,"Reasons for a buy in:

-Incredible value
You‚Äôve heard this before, now let‚Äôs understand why.  Looking at the cyber security industry, BB outperforms on a number of metrics.  Price to sales is 5.85 vs 11.31 industry.  As well price to book is 3.11 vs industry 11.44, this indicates relative to its industry BB is highly undervalued(Value investors look for P/B ~(0-3), so BB just about fits in there). They also operate on gross margins 3.3% higher than industry.  All this to say, BB is going to reach a more accurate share price, it‚Äôs just a matter of timeüöÄüöÄüöÄ
-outperforms market in cyber security, 10% more growth on the year than the industry average and it still has undervalued metrics, this is only the beginningüöÄüöÄüöÄ
AWS Partnership

-Partnership with Amazon Web Services to expand QNX systems that are already trusted and viable.  New system will be backed by Amazon and allow new capabilities for car manufacturers to interpret sensor data and improve driving experience for their cars.  Possible features included but not limited to predictive maintenance, tracking driving habits and even book spots for EV charging along your route.  Once integrated with Amazon‚Äôs IoT and machine learning services, IVY will be ready and is expected in 2023.üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

-Amazon is helping to market IVY so it will be extremely competitive from an industry leading cloud computing company and also backed by the goat of cyber security (BB), their birth child IVY will secure Tendies for all WSB retardsüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
-John Chenüëë

Saved BB in 2013 from sinking to nothing with Apple as competition, pioneered them back to the front(soon)of another field and is still CEO.  If that wasn‚Äôt enough, he is taking bonuses in shares and gets a huge bonus when shares reach $30, this means his bottom line for the company vision is the same as ours. SharesüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüåö
-Large Mobilization of Funds

BB sold 90 patents to Huawei, which serves 2 fold, no more fees on those patents and also increased capital.  As well they settled with FB for an unknown amount, this also is a double edged sword, no more uncertainty(or fees) due to lawsuit and they will have a sizable settlement (hopefully to spend on R &amp;amp; D) for IVYüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Reasons (not)to Buy:

Earnings Down/
Analysis, QNX loses a significant portion of revenue, given auto industry was significantly impacted, so was licensing sales of QNX, Chen says sales will return to previous when auto sales correct.

If IVY cannot increase profit margins or expand user base it will be an R and D cost alone...  Given the new value however, I‚Äôm confident in its larger profit margin. Or at the very least in leu of new value and a credible partnership significant increase in licensing sales, especially so in the Emerging EV market!üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

In the interest of consistency, and because everybody needs to be chipping in right now, here‚Äôs the scans that caught my eye today heading into next week. Mondays are my best days so Ill have way more then, EOD.

üê≥üßê**Overall, whales kept betting on tech to bounce back heavily**, in convincing style (signals that indicated the call blocks were more than just hedging). Image links are call blocks from each. **Intitial research is often with barchart, but I always check for confirmation with Unusual Whales**

[FB](https://i.imgur.com/A0R2dz2.jpg) üöÄüöÄüöÄ: until the bitter end today, people were feverishly pumping call blocks with puts aligning them. If tech bounces back, FB in particular is due for a rip after correcting post-earnings

[Unusual Whales research confirmation: strong 2/5 call block ](https://i.imgur.com/H7onSWz.jpg)

[DKNG](https://i.imgur.com/wapFAGh.jpg) üöÄüöÄ: lots of sporadic call clusters like this. PENN gets most of the glory, but there are a lot of catalysts coming around state regulations soon. Load up some 2/26 and wait for the pop

[Unusual Whales research confirmation: repeated weeklies each week, such as this. ](https://i.imgur.com/imHvK1O.jpg)

[AMZN](https://i.imgur.com/bfCXbJj.jpg) üöÄüöÄüöÄ: the bulls are buying calls heavily in anticipation of earnings. If you think you know what a good beat is, just wait for AMZN Christmas results

[Ununsual Whales?: yep](https://i.imgur.com/3R6pPLI.jpg)

BONUS: sporadic FDX call orders have come in. After an oversell for FDX recently, AMZN sympathy is plausible based on orders.

[Unusual Whales spotted a sneaky FDX call order for 2/12](https://i.imgur.com/JX0HwyD.jpg)

[INTC](https://i.imgur.com/F2SUHPy.jpg) üöÄ : yes. I know INTC can be awful. But tons of pump since the ER. they have a new CEO everyone is excited about now, and look to have found a bottom. I like this.

**Recent Earnings**

Fiscal Quarter End| Date Reported| Earnings Per Share* | Consensus EPS* Forecast| % Surprise
---|---|----|----|----
Nov 2020| 12/17/2020| 0.1 | -0.04| 100

Feb 2020| 03/31/2020| 0.06| 0.01| 500



Surprises along the board.

* Revenues last quarter, $224 MM.
* Revenues projected for Q4, $246 MM.
* Full year Guidance 2021, $950 MM. 
* Mkt cap, $4 B. 
Total company non-GAAP revenue of $224 million; total company GAAP revenue of $218 million. Non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.02; GAAP loss per basic and diluted share of $0.23. Net cash generated from operating activities of $29 million.



Saw this cute image of CRWD PLTR and SNOW, all with similar or lower Revs but SNOW is half but worth 20x BB, CRWD has less revs but is operating at 11.75x, PLTR (WSB fav) has 50M more projected annual revs and is worth 11x. Alright who cares about revenue, that's only today. If only it accounted for the big event happening in the next 9 days (see news events below).

**NEWS EVENTS**

*FB settlement*

I‚Äôm not going to go into deep detail here as it is quite intricate and all I know is that BB won a suit against fuckerberg $FB related to messaging, whatsapp, and something else. $FB has till January 15th, 2020 to settle, see here: https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.331602/gov.uscourts.cand.331602.144.0.pdf 

This FB settlement is not included in earnings expectations, meaning THAT SHIT GOES UP or will be in analyst projections.

*BlackBerry IVY - Intellectual Vehicle Data Platform*

The big kahuna that will change BB for the next few years. Per BB website: ‚ÄúBlackBerry and AWS are joining forces to develop BlackBerry IVY, a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology.‚Äù

What does it mean to the end consumer (the automakers?)

**IVY Fueling Business Outcomes**

BlackBerry IVY will help automakers and automotive suppliers:

Fuel Innovation by supporting rapid development of new customer experiences
Drive Revenue by unlocking new revenue streams and business models
Reduce Costs by moving processing to the edge & reducing raw data transmission
Improve Operations with enhanced data visibility and access
Expand Ecosystems by unlocking the broader app developer community

Want a TL;DR? Automotive, cloud, cybersecurity, IOT, electric vehicles, every bubble on the planet. And this shit got all of it. Want more info? https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/aws Read this and watch their conferences coming up.

**Partnerships with big companies**

Blackberry partnered with Zoom (link: https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/10/blackberry-and-zoom-together-secure-your-virtual-enterprise-meetings), Microsoft Teams (link: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-athoc-integrates-with-microsoft-teams-for-critical-event-management-301147559.html) and some other company that I forgot. Cybersecurity adding onto big big platforms that exploded this past year. MORE MONEY you dumbasses.

Patents
BB started offloading old patents but have one that will be important as of recent, with the sexiest one being this: https://uspto.report/patent/grant/10880812 

Very pretty stuff, big sex.


**Business Implications**

BB makes their money from licensing, cybersecurity (one of the only companies that have not been hacked in this SolarWind shit), BB QNX is already in 175 MM cars worldwide, partnered with XPEV, and is in talks with multiple Tier 1 automakers, 20 different OEMs, and will be in vehicles by 2023. Does that mean anything now? Yes, you dumbass. Per CEO John Chen, my new president, #DidYouKnow @BlackBerry has been selected by 19 of the top 25 #ElectricVehicle manufacturers, and they represent 61% of the Electric Vehicle market?

Bubblicious and sexy. Expect some of the big tier 1s like Nissan, Toyota, BMW, and others to jump on this train. Think TSLA doesn‚Äôt have competition? Bitch they cant even make a billion dollars unless they sell stock (which since MS just upgraded their price, I bet they offer at least $5B in stock in the coming days).

**CONFERENCES**  

BB is speaking at the following conferences:

Citi‚Äôs 2021 Global TMT West Virtual Conference - Thursday January 7th, 2021 at 1 PM with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) 

JP Morgan 19th Annual Tech / Auto Forum

Needham‚Äôs 23rd Annual Virtual Growth Conference 
Friday, January 15th, 2021 at 1:15 pm ET 
With Ryan Permeh, Blackberry Chief Security Architect & Co-founder of Cylance and Eric Cornelius, Blackberry Chief Product Architect 

This was just announced and you bet your ass this will pump this stock up.



**Conclusion:**

This stock will generate a lot more cash in the coming years, will gain in the short term by offloading old patents, settling with FB and getting some moolah, growing in their partnership with Bezos gang, roll out to more EVs with Tier 1 and Tier 2 automotive companies, and compete with Tesla on this as well. This shit trades at $6.70 and is so close to going up if the market just doesn‚Äôt crash in the interim. They already are used by big companies for Access and other Mobile applications, so that someone can securely use their dinky iPhone to work. Think big whales aren‚Äôt interested? Look at 2022 2023 option OI. 

I think this goes to lower PT of $10 by May, more likely $15. uThInKitWiLLdOUbleINmKTcAp???? Yes you fucking idiot, this is trading at 4X sales only, will be profitable this year, and has so much shit coming up. This is UNDER 4B!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just buy the stock and sit on it. Want options?

2021-01-30 11:31:08,Theory of Current Market Conditions (DD),"**TL;DR** High short % stocks are **nuclear bombs** going off that are sucking capital out of the market into the mushroom clouds that are currently ascending into the stratosphere. Read further for more details on this retarded theory.

**Disclaimer**: I‚Äôm retarded and have been wrong in the past. This is fan fiction and fairy tales **not financial or investment advice**.

So during the last 2 weeks our wonderful subreddit blew up and is now pretty much known by every person on the fucking planet. I've looked at what is happening overall in the market vs what is happening in the high short % stocks during that time. I've selected a 2 week timeline because I believe during this time everyone on the market (including hedge funds) have discovered what's moving these stocks.

Here's the figures since January 19th (18th markets were closed). I've included the most popular high short % stocks since they're what retail investors (we) seem to be buying with our mouths foaming. I apologize if I left out your favourite meme stock, fuck you, keep reading it's about to get more interesting.

**Timeline: January 19th - January 29th**

High short interest stocks:

GME +680%
AMC +330%
LGND +47% 
SPWR +46%
SPCE +40%
BBBY +35%
FUBO +30%

Even half blind smooth brains can see they are all mooning. But why are GME and AMC outperforming the rest? We'll come back to them later. Next up is looking at the performance of other shit on the market. I've tried to select large cap stocks and indices that are relevant to the situation, you retards can go and look up the rest and **prove me wrong.**

**Timeline: January 19th - January 29th** 

Selected stocks & indices:

S&P 500 -2,2%
NASDAQ -0,5%
AAPL +3,2%
MSFT +8,5%
FB +0,5%
TSLA -5,2%
GOOGL +2,4%

What's interesting about this you say? Everything seems  normal, they're mostly flat, who the fuck cares right? You would be right, during the 2 week timeline things look pretty normal.

Now let's look what has happened since **shit hit the fan** on Thursday (28th) after Robinhood started to limit the buys on meme stocks and **EVERYONE** started to talk about wsb and retail investors hunting stocks with high short %.

**Timeline: January 28th - January 29th**

Selected stocks & indices:

S&P 500 -1,14%
NASDAQ -2%
AAPL -5,3%
MSFT -1,8%
FB -7,3%
TSLA -2,5%
GOOGL -0,5%

Everything is red. Why is that weird? For one FB, MSFT, AAPL actually **all beat earnings** released last week (TSLA missed). Why are investors not piling onto these stocks? There's multiple reasons and here's where the **nuclear bomb theory** comes into picture. I suggest you put on your cloak and wizard hat it's about to get retarded.

I believe the smart money realized what's about to happen and are exiting their long positions. By smart money I'm referring to hedge funds like Melvin Capital who are losing $3B a month. Even you degenerates here have exited your other positions and YOLO'd into GME and AMC. As many people here with IQ above 80 have earlier stated a lot of these hedge funds are piled onto the same long and short positions. The biggest short positions they're in are most likely all in the red because the short squeeze frenzy happening. They're scared shitless over the idea they might be caught in a situation like Melvin where they need to be bailed out by buddies or even worse, go tits up. Some of them saw this earlier and probably were smart enough to cover and close their shorts. Some of them have not covered or even worse may have doubled down on shorts. Since last Thursday these clowns have a planet full of üíé‚úä retards bidding up their short positions.

I believe to avoid blowing up their chad funds, on Thursday and Friday they started to liquidate their long positions to be able to cover the short positions. What happens when a bunch of these suits start exiting at the same time? It tanks the stock (which I believe is happening to AAPL, MSFT, FB and many others, possibly the whole market). This leads to a cycle where even more funds want to liquidate long positions because suddenly they're losing money on the shorts (mooning) and longs (tanking). Remember these people are leveraged **TO THE TITS** so in an event where they're losing on all fronts they may be forced to liquidate positions to avoid margin calls.

Moving capital from their longs to cover their short positions will make things **even worse** for the not so smart funds that have not yet covered. High short % stocks will moon even harder due to other funds covering and the boomer long positions they are in will drill down even more. 

In this situation GME and AMC are **Little Boy** and **Fat Man** (read your history kids). They are the first and the second **Nuclear Bomb** to drop. They will suck all the surrounding capital into a mushroom cloud ascending into the stratosphere. Why are GME and AMC blowing up especially bigly? Because they do shit even your 90 year old grandma can understand. Depending how the situation evolves, other high short % stocks may or may not join them in their ride to the heavens (my opinion is they will be duds). I'm seeing a lot of turmoil in the upcoming weeks, look at what happened to VIX last week.

2021-02-25 21:10:59,Possible Correlation?,"So for this entire week I‚Äôve noticed some interesting stock trends and I wanted to run my question by a few reliable and intelligent minds.  Unfortunately none of them were available, so I‚Äôm stuck with my fellow smooth-brained apes.  Hopefully our individual brain cells can work together to answer my question:

Is there a possibility that the dips of every major stock on the market could be caused by shorts selling to cover GME?

I ask because prior to GME rising, the prices of FB, AMZN, AAPL, NFLX, GOOGL, TSLA, and almost ever other big boy on the market dropped despite the DOW closing at record highs.  I‚Äôve never seen that before.  I‚Äôve owned AAPL for the last six years and I have never (and I mean NEVER) seen the stock drop $2-$3 consecutively for this long.  AAPL has been one of my safest and most consistent investments, so I‚Äôm a little surprised.  Especially since they just posted over $100 billion in revenue last quarter.  It doesn‚Äôt make sense.  Almost every ticker on my watch list is down by a lot.  Of the 40 tickers currently on my watchlist, GME is the only one in the green.

2021-01-31 15:11:04,Why It's Smart to Hold - Capitalism 101 and Media Manipulation 101,"\*This is not financial advice. I'm just sharing random thoughts for entertainment purposes only. 

**This upcoming week is the opportunity of a century.**   
**What you do is up to you, but this is how I see things.** 

**First, an overview of what happened last week:**  
\-There was an immense wealth transfer of billions of dollars from HF's like Melvin to the retail investor.  
\-Citron announced that they will no longer enter massive short positions.    
\-Robinhood expands trade restrictions on more stocks, and then retracts them on positions like AMD, AAL and BBBY (no more limits!), and relaxing the share/call restrictions on NOK.  
\-Cramer said last Friday that GME holders ""already won,"" that they must take profits, or otherwise risk ""immense pain"".   
\-CNBC spent all day talking about how risky GME is at this point for the retail investor.   
\-Friday was the lowest day for the market since October 2020.   
\-CNBC also bought ""paid promotions"" on Twitter and FB linking news that Melvin closed all their GME positions. 

Guys, I've worked in the Hollywood TV Industry as a development executive. I know firsthand how the media manipulates the masses. If it's not damn clear by now, we're being manipulated in a textbook fashion so that we sell our positions in ""the stocks we like"". Why? Maybe because Melvin still has short positions. They're a bunch of smart, manipulative bastards. **Except, the bigs f\*d up their media manipulation strategy (or couldn't execute properly due to the overall pandemonium), and I foresee even greater losses for them. Here's why:**

**1) Don't Think of Elephants**

Quoting JGL's character in *Inception*, what happens when someone tells you to not think of elephants? You think of elephants. 

Robinhood essentially outlined which stocks we need to buy by telling us not to buy them. Also, they actually made each of the ""do-not-buy a lot"" stocks more valuable by lowering the supply without lowering the consumer demand.

Actually, how they SHOULD'VE played this was by temporarily adding fees to those specific stocks. This strategy worked for California groceries. Once groceries started charging for plastic bags, people brought their own from home, which stopped excessive use of environmentally hazardous single-use plastic bags. You might think I opened pandora's box on a really good idea. Not really. It's too late. If Robinhood does add fees back, we will migrate to Fidelity, Ameritrade or E\*Trade, if not now, then later. Robinhood's fee structure and profitability is not our problem. They already tarnished their brand. It's too late to add fees now, because it will be ""on top of"" all the bs they did last week. They needed to choose the ""less bad"" decision and picked the worse one. 

**2) Fear, Uncertainty, Destruction (FUD)**

So, in tandem with the brokerages, CNBC and other mainstream news outlets tried to lower the demand on GME, AMC, NOK, BB, etc. by spreading fear that ""retail investors will be in for some real pain"". Do we believe what they're saying? Nope. Why waste precious airtime for the entire day, discouraging retail investors from buying more of the underlying? Because Melvin and other Hf's still have open short positions. Thursday's GME low was $112. If they couldn't buy to close then, they surely didn't do that on Friday. 

**3) Opportunities**

a. **Black Friday of the Century**  
Hold your stonks. Hold your leaps. There's gonna be an immense, pent-up demand and a surge in prices for each of the stocks outlined in Robinhood. They gave us a cheat sheet for what stocks to buy and hold for the immense price hike to come. If you already bought GME and the others, this is like owning a PS5 before everyone got them. Hold, because the prices are gonna be insane. 

b. **Retail Arbitrage of the Century**  
If you didn't already, open up new accounts on E\*trade or Ameritrade, Buy those ""do not buy a lot of"" stocks you can't get on Robinhood. It will be the price arbitrage of the century once Robinhood is forced to lift restrictions on those stocks. Not gonna say more.

TL;DR - There's obvious manipulation by the brokerages and media. Melvin is not in the clear. We must buy and hold, and take advantage of the immense demand surge that'll happen due to the brokerage's desperate, last minute reactive measure. Media manipulation only hints further that GME and other stonks are far from ""done"".",423,0.98

Obligatory: I'm long a single share of GME, am not very smart, and you shouldn't take financial advice from anyone in this sub.
This is opinion only in nature and i aim only to discuss possibilities and their outcomes.

Tldr at bottom:

Okay, WSB is simply a very large pool of investors who are concerned for the capital of short sellers investors. We all individually decided that these HF's took on infinite risk vs reward and that its problematic and scary.

We have encouraged each other to hold our positions so that HF's lose money and stop taking on trades that can cause serious economic turmoil.

So here's the skinny: No one is margin calling these guys, and they aren't dying from the interest yet. They are holding.

But what if their capital left?
The questions needed to be answered are

1.) ""what HF's are actively short GME, AMC, ETC. ""

2.) Who do they manage funds for ( is it 100% millionaire entrepreneurs or is it teachers pensions, police pension funds and the like).

3.) Do THEIR investors understand that these HF's risked taking their investments to zero and actually bringing the HF into the negative?

4.) Can retail {legally} , an independent collective concerned for above mentioned pensions have a (or many) reputable securities lawyer reach out to Hf's clients and be sure they are aware of the immenent risks?

I'm going to guess that most people aren't aware that their investment fund is risking 100% of their money going out the window. Probably think its all in goog, aapl, and fb. 

It's not retail investors fault that they took on infinite risk and things didn't go their way. But retail may be able to burn the shorts and not the pensions managed by them all at the same time.

Poke holes in my theory, brain is smooth like a bowling ball, small computations only.

Edit: to those calling me a bot, or saying im doing HF's bidding. This isn't a sob story narrative, no one should feel bad about pensions as collateral damage except the Hf's who took on infinite risk. The only interest in who's assets under management they have is to tell them their investment with HF might blow up and maybe they take their capital out, choking HF's solvency out. 

Tldr: could wsb retain a securities lawyer (s) to help HF investors / e.g. pension managers understand the true risks of their GME, AMC etc short positions. Possibly rug pulling short sellers capital for a checkmate. Excluding any lock up periods",68,0.66

SQ / PYPL
Lots of upgrades on PYPL feel imminent, SQ has been lazy of late, and maybe some bets on the digital rebound

-saw blocks like this trickle in all week

[PINS](https://i.imgur.com/41AqcAh.jpg)
-got a nice upgrade to BUY, ER Is around the corner. I don‚Äôt think the algos picked up the upgrade yet

[SPCE](https://i.imgur.com/qKQ1nS4.jpg)
-somebody rushed a bunch of calls through EOD. My best guess is imminent space launch or something 

[NVAX](https://i.imgur.com/ebyj4B7.jpg)
-saw deep OTM calls coming in towards the end of the week. Could be big news coming, or could‚Äôve been an assumption based on all the weird vaccine news about PFE and MRNA that came

**Edit**: there were some I forgot to mention because I didn‚Äôt have screenshots. ZNGA going absolutely apeshit, FSLY with quite a few calls after an upgrade, and INTC very bullish call volume and OI on the heels of a few upgrades after their ER plunge. There were tons of PT upgrades for tech last week, seems like names can üöÄ next week with earnings season here.

Needham‚Äôs 23rd Annual Virtual Growth Conference, Friday, January 15th, 2021 at 1:15 pm ET, With Ryan Permeh, Blackberry Chief Security Architect & Co-founder of Cylance and Eric Cornelius, Blackberry Chief Product Architect 

They also had were at the JPM Auto and Tech conference yesterday, here's my recap: Takeaways from $BB $JPM conference: tons of value, competition isn't even comparable, 7 big rev streams possible from BB &QNX and IVY on top of it is a huge add on, IVY is 50-50 with $AMZN (dev and all. It is not some AWS relationship). There is INSANE value here. TSLA can be a customer. They have a HUGE percentage of the EV world already are customers of BB. QNX by BB is in 175 MM cars already. 

This shit is only at 4x sales, and by the end of 2021, it will be at 10x sales with sales at least doubling. Watch their new revenue streams.

Recent new customer and order that no one is talking about: https://www.electrive.com/2021/01/11/huge-order-for-lion-electric-trucks-from-amazon/ 2025 delivery order already created and guess what, it definitely will have IVY by BB and AMZN. no one is talking about this shit. 

Positions: some weekly 7.5 C, feb 7C, Jan ‚Äò22 10C, a ton of shares. I am loaded to the tits and I buy on every paycheck.

2021-02-27 18:02:31,Weekly Market Forecast - 2021-02-27 YOLO Capital,"Hello Apes,  
This is one of my first posts and am going to try to make this a weekly thing to help you apes and autists out. 

Hedgefunds and asset management firms have these analysts preparing all these market forecasts all the time. I feel like us apes could come together to defeat the hedgies by putting all our thoughts together and getting a sense of how the market might look like in the near future. So we can get tendies! Who wants tendies? I want tendies!

Please note this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. I am just an ape. This is purely for education purpose. Please consult a financial advisor not me.

You all must be wondering, what the hell is going on in the market lately? Why are stonks down? Where are my tendies?

Well Apes, apparently there are these things called bonds. JPOW sells these things at auctions and people buy them! Can you believe it? People actually buy things other than stonks.

Lately these bond traders have been very worried that things are getting back to normal! There's $1.9 trillion on its way and that means tendies! Tendies for everyone! And that means prices of things might go up. And if that happens then Fed might have to raise interest rates to keep the prices from getting out of control!

These genuis bond traders have ultra paper hands and they were expecting rates to rise in 2023. But they are afriad they might go up in 2022! Oh lawd! Have mercy.

If interest rates go up. It means stonks go down! Witchcraft! These bond traders are scared and pooping their pants. No one is buying, which is driving the prices of some of these bonds down. means yields are rising! Rising yields oh no!  Everyone is panicking and cashing out.

So bond traders are all looking at JPOW like what you gonna do. You gonna keep running that printer or stop? JPOW is like. Whatever YOLO. But bond traders are not convinced. They feel like JPOW like a cheating boyfriend is lying and will probably backstab them and raise rates.

So bond traders don't wknow what to do. They are panicking. Scared and running around like chickens without heads. All this fear is spreading into the stock market and people are selling their stocks.

Stocks are down! Stocks are down! Stocks are down!

So what's ahead? Well Feb's job report is out on FRIDAY. If the numbers look good Thats Bad! Good means bad because it means things are getting back to normal. No! Bond traders don't want things to get back to normal. If numbers are bad Thats good! Because that means less risk of higher rates.

Good is bad and bad is Good!  What in the world is going on?!?

Well - All you need to know is JPOW is speaking on Thursday. Everyone will be watching. If he says something stupid... Stonks will go down. So lets hope he doesn't say anything stupid. Job reports out on Friday. If report is good then more red! 

Also - Expect some more red if bond traders panic a bit more and drag the stocks down. If there is fear in the market then fewer insitutions will buy stuff. Apes are still buying. So keep buying and keep holding those diamond hands. Don't paper hand! Hold Strong! Let the insitution paper hand. If we keep holding. The market will stabilize in the next week or so. If we buy that means more tendies.

All the best Apes. Just remember, expect turbulence ahead. But it will pass in a week or so. As soon as those stimulus cheques hit the streets, there will be tendies! Glorious tendies.

2021-01-20 15:08:05,What causes the sudden hype around BB,"Hi everyone,

Lately i've been pretty busy with gme and i haven't been able to follow the upcoming bb hype. I've been trying to find what caused the sudden hype but i can't seem to find it really.

 I know that they've pivoted away from phones to software for self driving cars, but i assume this has been known for quite a while. I also know they settled a suit with FB, but i wouldn't expect something like that to trigger this much hype. So why the sudden change in popularity? And what is the bull case for it that suddenly made the stock such a compelling choice to invest in?

Tl;DR what is causing the BB hype, and how far will it go

FYI GME to the moon, but my wife's boyfriend told me to diversify",144,0.88

2021-01-31 22:22:15,How to instant transfer from RH FAST and without fees,"If you have a Robinhood debit card, you can set it up as your payment method on FB messenger and send your spouse or yourself somehow (beware of sending it to someone else and gifting tax). It goes through immediately with no fees. For example, I sent it to my husband. Then it gets auto deposited into our bank for immediate use. No needing to wait days for them to transfer it to your bank. 

I can then use the funds to purchase stock WeBull or another platform. Obviously, you have to sell stock to access your capital so I wouldn‚Äôt use this method for the money invested in AMC and GME. Personally, I‚Äôm leaving those stocks in Robinhood for now but transferring any other capital that I can to a platform that doesn‚Äôt limit my purchasing power.

You can check how much cash you have accessible by clicking on transfers and scrolling down to ‚Äúwithdrawable cash.‚Äù This is not financial advice. I‚Äôm just an idiot who knows how to pull out.

**There‚Äôs also an account number and routing number on RH. Even if you don‚Äôt have a card, this may be a means to transfer.**

üöÄüöÄüöÄ GME üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Edit: Reminding you that selling is a taxable event, transferring brokerages generally is not but takes longer. Even though RH halting and limiting cost people (myself included) thousands and thousands of dollars...it‚Äôs important to leave enough capital so that once your transactions are ‚Äúsettled‚Äù everyone gets what they‚Äôre due. This is merely a suggestion from a moron in direct response to those looking to liquidate other stock and buy more on platform that allows unlimited buys.",156,0.93

Trump to sign executive order on social media on Thursday: White House

If Trump migrates to Facebook it will be a complete gamechanger. It will be like MrBabyMan leaving Digg for Reddit (kuz that probably happened). All because Twitter wanted to give us these stupid things called facts. Who needs those when we only have a 144 characters to type a world changing message anyway?

Don't bet against the mouse and don't bet against the POTUS.

Mark Zuckerberg, said censoring a platform would not be the ‚Äúright reflex"" so hes signlaling that Facebook may layoff their mods anyway. Since mods are gay the LGBT community may be up in arms about losing their jannies. That said, layoffs are great for profit margins and stocks go up when that happens. 

FB to 260 tomorrow for sure. Twitter probably drops below 30 but dont be a sucker and buy the dip, its a dead cat bounce for sure.",19,0.75

2021-03-02 15:04:10,Who‚Äôs Buying ZNGA?,"Would/should $AAPL Buy $ZNGA? How about $SNAP? Or $FB?

Zynga (yes, the FarmVille one) has had a solid year. They‚Äôve shown good profit and have a strong outlook for 2021. When they‚Äôre compared to competitors they‚Äôre undervalued by about $5 per share depending on the day. They hold solid market share, and have agreements in place for strong properties (Harry Potter and Star Wars to start). 

I‚Äôve been reading some speculative rumors that Zynga has been having some discussions about being acquired by a larger company. I‚Äôve seen arguments Snap has a standing agreement with Zynga for gaming, and Facebook will, at some point, need to work more on diversifying. Both want need to expand into new realms of revenue and buying a profitable company with a growing user base would be a solid move.  However, I want to throw an idea out there that Apple could have a good case to buy Zynga to bolster their own somewhat feeble (for Apple) gaming division both on mobile and on devices like the Apple TV.

There is apparently a new TV coming out, but at what point is that device pointless when a lot of TVs are coming with Apple software native to the TVs OS?  To me, the logical expansion is to make it a more gaming friendly console and a good way to do that is to add a suite of games by buying the dev. 

On mobile the draw is more so to cut out the middle man and add Zynga profits to their own. Zynga also owns rights to some great properties and has a close competitor to Fortnite coming out. This would help Apple fight Fortnite its self and the messy battle that that is turning into.



I put some money on $ZNGA for these reasons. If not Apple, someone might snatch this one up before WSB decides to YOLO it like $GME",12,0.67

**$BABA**: WHERE IS JACK MA??!!?!?!!

**$BB:** It‚Äôs 2012, and you‚Äôve just discovered how to connect your Curve to your car with bluetooth.

**$F:** F

**$FB**: You are just happy you don‚Äôt own $TWTR‚Ä¶ right?

**$GOOG**: You have a pet chameleon, or python, or some other cool but slow-moving animal.

**$MSFT:** You are a boomer, but want to hang with the youths so you bought some LEAPS. No one thinks you‚Äôre cool.

* Dems clinched the GA Senate run-off election as Warnock defeats Loeffler while Ossoff defeats Perdue (the first millennial Senator). As the results became more clear last night, futures took a deep dive particularly for NQ, while conversely small caps enjoys a favorable bump. The market opened deeply red for QQQ as big tech retreated with renew fear on antitrust probes  and overall an unfriendly corporate environment as Democrats will control WH and both chambers of Congress. 

* By early morning, the sell-off quickly reversed and big tech recovered most of their red, with big tech such as AAPL going from -3% to just shy of yesterday's close during day's high. In contrast to big tech, clean tech and weed soared on Dems securing the Senate. ICLN was up almost 4% during pre-market and as high as 9% during intraday high and HASI was up 10% during intraday high. Weed stock such as TLRY was up as high as 21%, ACB as high as 11%+, and APHA as high as 14%.

* Things quickly pulled back and tech started fading in earnest at 2:15 PM ET when protestors [cosplaying as revolutionaries](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106820104-1609961746992-gettyimages-1230453313-AFP_8YA6MW.jpg) stormed the capitol and Congress had to quickly pause their certifying of the Electoral College votes. Shit got real when a lady got shot as these protestors attempt to storm the [barricaded House chamber](https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1600/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F210106150417-03-house-chamber-0106.jpg) while Reps were still in the building.

* The sell-off accelerated for AAPL, AMZN, FB, MSFT, and NFLX as most drilled back to opening lows by EOD. AAPL closed the day -3.37% to $126.60, AMZN -2.49% to $3,138, FB -2.83% to $263, MSFT -2.59% to $212, and NFLX -3.9% to $500.49. Thanks to overall negative sentiment of all things tech, QQQ closed the day red at -1.39% to $307 (retreating quite a bit more than IXIC given the weigh of big tech in QQQ).

* Morning economic numbers had ADP reporting payrolls dropping to 123k in Dec, slightly below consensus of 130k. PMI was at 54.8 while consensus was 55.3, while factory order was up 1.0% MoM. Thankfully, none of these number fucking matters as the Dow, SPY, and IWM proceed to sky rocket with the market looking forward to stronger spending and stimulus from a Dem controlled govt.

* Beyond weed, clean tech, and infrastructure - financial sector killed it today in particular mid-cap banks such as ZION (up 11.24%), CNC (up 9.81%), and KEY (up 9.73%). You'll find a similar story for large-cap bank stock with JPM closing up 4.70%, BAC up 6.25%, C up 5.75%, and WFC up 7.08%. It's a good thing I've already dumped my reopening [WFC leaps play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kftjzt/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/ggarcbi/) of $25c and $30c which are now fucking ITM by $3~$8 and still have a year left to go on them. Nice.

* In yet another confusing about-face and showing a real Karen spunk, the NYSE is *really* delisting the three Chinese telecoms this time. The real kicker though came in at 2:25 PM ET when news broke that US officials are considering *more* Chinese stock delisting, adding Chinese big tech Alibaba, Tencent, et al. to the potential list. A sea of red soon followed to compound the sell-off as BABA crater to the Earth's core and closed down -5.32%. Following suit, PDD closed down -5.58%, JD down -7.66%, and the same goes for Chinese EV NIO at -5% and XPEV at -2.62%. LI escapes semi-unscathed and closed the day up 2.48% thanks to a new BofA coverage with a Buy rating and a PT of $42.

* In WSB meme stock land, GME was on track for a solid 8-9% day until the storming of the capitol occurred, PLTR's fade accelerated further while MT stays modestly flat, bouncing back from the overall market sell off. GME closed up 5.70% to $18.36, PLTR closed down -4.31% to $23.54, and MT closed up 0.32% to $24.70. ICLN, a new WSB favorite due to new balance of power in Congress might be added to future roundup if it continues to pump. Imagine that, a clean energy boomer ETF becoming a meme stock. The iShares fund managers are probably wondering why their alerts going tits up with social media mentions and sentiment brewing.

* Random trade ideas (these are not financial advice and if it goes wrong that's your own gdamn fault):

    1) FSLY leaps Jan 2022 90c or 100c+ for eventual TikTok climbing back fully onto the service as ByteDance pointedly makes a political jab at outgoing administration. Headwind on this retarded play: cloud/stay-at-home stock continues to take a beating as rona gets under control as vaccine roll out picks up. 

    2) Sell AAPL cash secured puts Jan 15 120p to 122p if the big tech fade continues rest of the week. These ~0.18 to 0.24 delta strikes are likely safe enough and if assigned, you'll have an upcoming ER on Jan 26 to sell IV pumped covered calls to get out of the trade intact. Feb 19 puts are likely okay to sell as well given you'll receive much more premium from the ~43 dte chains. Headwinds on this retarded play: its CSP and CC. As boomer as it gets. 

    3) BABA leaps and/or March debit call spread for another bounce in a wild trading week for BABA. March 230c/250c is probably a sufficient spread while baking in a bit of IV via ER which is on Feb 11. Jan 230c to 250c if you're not poor. Headwind on this retarded play: Jack Ma really is missing and the US govt really will delist a 600 bil market cap Chinese ADR, forcing out all major US institution holders. Yeah, right.

* The DOW closed up 1.44% or 437 pts, Nasdaq down -0.61% or -78 pts, S&P up 0.57% or 21 pts, and RUT closed up 3.98% (!!) or 78 pts. Stay in school kids and avoid storming federal buildings or Twitter will start banning your fucking account. (TWTR locks POTUS account for 12 hrs and is down -1.99% AH).

\*(According to Tradingview)

We already know that FB and Microsoft have benefitted from conferencing and everyone staying home during the lockdowns despite both (more the former than the later) having drops earlier this month.

So the earnings will be up (not that if they were negative it would change much) **so it's a very important thing to consider as the stock prices will likely go up.**

We already knew of the Qualcomm news with apple and factories in china starting to re-open production, will likely have a decent earnings which means the price will go up.

TSLA is arguably a scam stock depending on who you talk to, but puts rarely if ever, work on it, and it continues to climb. If there is a bubble to pop it won't be happening until it hits around or near $1000 per share.

***SPY was already up pre-market and continued climbing throughout the day today despite higher unemployment numbers, more business closures, and GDP contraction.***

All 5 will receive an ***additional benefit*** due to Dr.Jerome's **FED Promise Gurantee**, which will involve the fed continuing to pump money into the economy, help banks and larger corporations, and will be purchasing more junk bonds, along with other manipulation tactics.

This means that if you go in on all 5 of these with calls there is a 89% chance you will be ranking in massive dow either by the end of tomorrow trading day or until the end of Fridays trading day.

**Never before has such a tsunami of money been (Potentially) on the table for free.** The only wild card is how much TSLA will climb, but you could remove that risk and still have a safe money making bet regardless.

Most of you already know gay mods are rampant here in WSB. But something truly sinister was revealed tonight that needs to be known.

Last night it was revealed our resident convict pharma bro Martin Shkreli was removed as a moderator. (FREE MY BOY MARTIN). Now, most of you retards don't care because you think he's locked up for lying to a Guarda truck driver (Security fraud) but Shrek is a god to us autists.

Stay with me you illiterate fucks.

Flashback to a few nights ago where zjz revealed the mod coup and the battle for helms deep round 2 occurred. Reddit admins removed zjz and said he can't come back for 6 months. Now I know you're thinking these two events aren't connected but take a look at this comment chain where this stupid gay mod spilled the beans..

Comment chain: [https://imgur.com/gallery/Txs86TI](https://imgur.com/gallery/Txs86TI)

Now you dumbasses with single-digit IQs are probably confused. But I have a pretty high IQ score according to a FB test my mother sent me. Let me help you put the pieces together.

1 - mod coup, zjz gets removed 

2 - Pharma bro shrek gets removed. 

3 - mod stylux says ""He's certain"" that zjz has a wu-tang album.

Tell me, how the fuck zjz obtained a wu-tang album? Unless... **ZJZ AND MARTIN ARE THE SAME FUCKING PERSON.**

Think about it. All that time in the pokey has allowed Martin to become a coding god and that's why his little merry band of gay automod bots were so good. I'm super concerned about the transparency around here.

I lost 7k in options on robinhood and stopped trading. Then after coviid hit, I took it as an opportunity to get out of this mess. bought stocks in cyclicals( airlines, restaurants, hotels, defense, housing) around may and they have been my biggest gains, also FB and PLTR. I switched to webull to avoid the sight of loss in all time. Never lose hope!",301,0.96
2020-11-15 06:44:23,"Load up on PLTR, big time, or you will miss it","Institutional ownership in this company went from 1% to almost 8% within a week(because it was a Direct Listing) and looking at the price charts, their average purchase range should be around $13-15.

This gives a floor for us retail investors and speculators out there. Price is UNLIKELY to go below this floor.

More institutional ownership is quite probably coming soon. This means money.

ARK, Soros sold a stake in JPM(probably, I forgot) to jump in PLTR.

Morgan Stanley raised the price target yet downgraded the stock, I don't know if it‚Äôs a dick move from their part to try to buy it at a lower price or maybe I am just over thinking.

Long term considerations:
This company is structured in a way in which the founders would gain insane amount of money if this stock prints(KINDA like how Musk benefitted from TSLA stock price)

Plus the total control of the founders(much like lizard man Zuck have over FB) mean shareholders cannot pull any funny business. This is significantly advantageous for PLTR for the business that it is in and the groupthink prevalent among tech workers.

They still don't have any direct competitor(not that I know of) and will have a revenue of $1B+ whereas their total addressable market size is $120B(somewhere near that ballpark, I read the SEC filings when they IPOed, but forgot the numbers and since they are building more and more products could increase TAM further).

Their software is infinitely adjustable and boy have you seen their customer retention and horizontal growth rate when they make a company Palantir's customer.

If you go to their Investors Relations website, you will see the numerous ways they are helping clients. One example, an oil major would save $1B annually for using Palantir's software.

They have an almost 10+ years head start in the business and the fact that it‚Äôs so deeply entrenched with the government means it ain't gonna become bankrupt.

I mean this shit can surpass NFLX or TSLA valuations if Karp's vision and various statements are realised.

Also remember, Peter Thiel and Alex Karp do not just work for money, they already have had a boatload(literally) of money and for them to stick to a product for nearly 17 years is definitely telling.

This company probably wouldn‚Äôt enter the Chinese market or more likely wouldn‚Äôt take any Chinese government contract.

Their margins are insane(forget NFLX, AAPL, TSLA etc) when their customers enter the scaling phase and their products are sticky as hell.

Short term considerations:
There's around 80% shares that COULD be unloaded in the market in the near future in 2021(again I forgot the exact date), surrounding this event, there could be significant price volatility, but we all know no one's mad enough to suddenly sell 80% of the shares.

Regardless, a lot of employees could exercise options constantly that they received as compensations as they didn‚Äôt get the chance to do so earlier at a fair price.

They raised their guidance. And do you know what market loves the most? Raised guidance. That's why even though market sold off by retail profit takers at first then it quickly went back to where it was. Monday could be higher.

This stock probably hasn‚Äôt really discovered its true pricing because of the still low institutional ownership and employees stock options activity.

The market(by market I mean some journos and analysts) still seems to misunderstand their product and think they are a data mining company, a consultant company, a fancy government contractor for specialist software etc. It is not any of them. I will let you discover yourself what this company is. It's kind of like how some boomer analysts still think a certain company is just a car company.

How to play this shit?
I think leaps or outright buying shares(then selling puts to generate income and buy more) is the best way, regardless, this is a matter I don't want to comment too much, I have given you some insight, now you do your own thing.

Remember, this isn‚Äôt NIO, it‚Äôs a much more bigger fish than that(if they can realise their long term goals).

Some resources for you to dive slightly deep.

2021-01-19 14:32:23,"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's and recent market driving news (Jan 19, 2021)","* The market performed strongly today with tech stock leading the way. Big tech such as FB and GOOGL closed up 3.9% and 3.3%, while MSFT closed up almost 1.8%. Conversely, select sectors were punished today as a rotation of sort occurred. Retail/consumer storefront took a beating with WMT down -0.86%, COST down -2.12%, TGT down -3.41%, DG down -2.54%, and BBY down -2.11%.

* It's another spectacular pump day for WSB cult gang as a new religion is formed where GME is the deliverance and the Moon (or Mars?) is the promised land. From fractional shares to irresponsible six figure plays near the recent top, the GME hype is so overwhelming that even WSB has quarantined them into a specific thread. GME opened at a strong 15%+ and went as high as 25%+ intraday to $45.52 but a tweet by Andrew ""tool bag"" Left of Citron at 9:58 AM derailed the party and sent shares under $37 before the bull run continued. Shares of GME closed $39.36, up 10.87% as shorts continue to be squeezed, though the momentum has clearly be snapped a bit.

* Over at BB land, shares of BlackBerry Ltd. pumped another 25% as the market continues to shift the company's valuation as the Canadian company chugs on with their focus on enterprise security software/service. BB closed up 25.51% to $12.35. 

* NFLX reported stellar numbers as sub count tops 200 mil. New net sub numbered in 8.5 mil, an uptick of 2.2 mil from the previous quarter and beats previous projection of 6 mil by 2.5 mil. NFLX sees Q1 additions of 6 mil. While Q4 EPS was $1.19 vs $1.39, NFLX sees Q1 EPS of $2.97 vs consensus of $2.10, further propelling the stock. Implied move was about 8% for weeklies so for those who YOLO'ed you're gucci as long as you didn't buy some retardedly OTM strike. NFLX is up 12.5% as of writing in AH to $564. DIS is up 2% AH and ROKU is up about 1.6%.

* GM pumped more than 9% today on news of MSFT 2 bil investment in GM's self-driving startup Cruise, valuing the side hustle at 30 bil. The boomer stock has low-key been killing it in the past few years and as Model 3 replaces the entry-level 3 series and C class in various neighborhoods, you'll likely see GM EVs replacing various Hondas and Toyotas in the coming years as well. GM closed up 9.75% to $54.84.

* Bank/financial earnings continues with BAC and GS reporting this morning. Both reported strong quarters tho the run-up may have been a bit too much as both underlyings faced the same sell-off pressure their sector faced last Thursday. BAC authorized a 2.9 bil repurchase plan, shares closed the day down slightly -0.73% to $32.77 while GS closed -2.26% to $294.

* Incoming Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urges Biden to act big to further help the rona punished economy, but also made some notes on raising corporate rates eventually (once the US overcomes rona). With Yellen set to replace Mnunchin, those who enjoyed Mnunchin's various stimulus phone tag with Pelosi will no doubt miss the ""stimulus talks are going well"" pumps.

* Shares of home builders reacted favorably to Biden's $15,000 first-time homebuyer tax credit proposal, though it will likely face an uphill battle in Congress given the various scope and size of the overall stimulus package. LEN is up 2%, DHI up 2.8%, PHM up 3%, NVR up 3.74%, and KBH up 5.5%.

* In WSB meme stock land not named GME and BB, ICLN closed up 2.75% as the cleantech pump resumes, while MT took a beating of -4% to closed at $22.96, despite a slight PT raise of .5 Euro by Morgan Stanley. Surely metal gang won't be another tanker gang situation.

* In recent IPO land, DASH is up 6.20% to $198 (yeah this 60 bil market cap makes tote sense), AFRM is down -5.14% to $110, AI pulled back -5.46% to $126, and ABNB closed up 2.61% to $173.

* The DOW closed up 0.38% or 116 pts, Nasdaq up a strong 1.53% or 198 pts, SPX up 0.81% or 30 pts, and RUT is up 1.32% or almost 28 pts.

* Notable ERs and numbers later this week: UAL, DFS after market close on Wednesday and INTC on Thursday after market close. Housing market index on Wednesday morning at 10 AM ET, jobless claims at 8:30 AM on Thursday, and on Friday PMI at 9:45 AM ET with existing home sales soon to follow at 10 AM ET.

2021-01-02 01:06:39,The Dummy's guide to trading the Georgia Senate Runoff,"**TLDR: There is a Senate runoff in Georgia on Jan. 5 that will determine which political party controls the Senate.   
If you are pretty sure about what the trajectory of the Georgia Senate Runoffs will be, you can make money. Scroll to the bottom for the plays.**  




**Introduction:**  
Recall the price action of QQQ (the tech etf we all know about) around Nov. 3. If you can't because you're that guy from the movie [Memento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_(film)) , pull out your Robinhood app and follow along with me kid:

On the eve of the general election, when most polls indicated that it would be a Democratic sweep, **QQQ sat at $269.** The next day, with the election contested, **QQQ rocketed to $294.** It remained steady on Friday, before declining the next week. 

Why did the election affect the price the way that it did? It is because Biden's legislative agenda depends on Democratic control of Congress. **In particular, a simple majority in the Senate allows President-elect Biden to raise corporate taxes to 28%, which [he has promised to do](https://joebiden.com/two-tax-policies/)**. These corporate taxes would heavily affect tech companies.


  
To explain, the institutional whales (the folks who actually move markets) believe that:

- Companies that benefitted bigly from Trump's tax cuts (tech companies especially) will be hurt by Biden raising taxes.
* Companies that would benefit from fiscal stimulus (green new deal, infrastructure) will be helped by Biden's plans, and even more if Biden controls Congress.  
* Regardless of who controls the Senate, the divided nature means some companies are guaranteed to benefit.



Don't take my word for it. Read this report from Goldman Sachs (p.15-16): https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/beyond-2020-post-election-policies-f/report.pdf  



Originally, tech companies (facing more regulation and tax increases under the Democratic Trifecta) were trending down. But when it seemed that the Republicans would hold the Senate with a 51 seat-majority, tech stocks made a sharp U-turn

Yet, there was a small blip downward the very next week. This was not a circumstantial correction. It happened because David Perdue (R) in Georgia fell below the threshold to prevent a Jan. 5 runoff, leaving the Republican majority at 50, and injecting the slim possibility for the Democrats to still fully control Congress.  

Now let's jump to the week ahead:

**Right now, Democrats control 48 seats in the U.S. Senate. If they can win both Georgia Senate runoffs on Jan. 5, they will have 50 seats.** With Vice-President Harris as the tie-breaker, they would be able to pass Democratic legislation like tax increases. **In other words, the outcome of this election would have a huge impact on certain stocks.**
&nbsp;

**Which stocks are impacted, and why**

If Democrats gain control of the U.S. Senate, that means Biden can pass his legislation.

* Some companies will be helped bigly (e.g. Renewables)
* Some companies may be hurt (more taxes) but also helped (more fiscal spending)
* Some companies may be hurt bigly (more taxes, regs, and less gov't subsidies)

To make this a pure election-related play, we want to trade:

* companies that benefit bigly from Democratic legislation (and don't have short-term non-political risk)
* companies that are hurt bigly from Democratic legislation (and don't have short-term non-political risk)

So what companies benefitted the most from Trump's tax cuts? (Source: Goldman Sachs Client note)  

* Tech companies like Netflix, which saw its effective tax rate go from 23% to 7%.
* Railroad companies like CSX, which saw its effective tax rate go from 37% to 23%.
* Healthcare companies like HCA, which saw its effective tax rate go from 32% to 20%.
* Pure financial companies like CME, saw their effective tax rate go from 36% to 23%.

Obviously, pandemic-related questions muddle price-action on healthcare. At the same time, there is still some policy uncertainty to what will happen to railroads regardless of the outcome of the runoffs (they will have higher taxes, but that may be offset by stimulus/infrastructure spending). That leaves two sectors as our pure election plays:

* Tech companies will get more regulation and higher taxes if Biden takes Senate
* Financials will get more regulation and higher taxes if Biden takes Senate

Out of those sectors, specific companies may be overvalued or undervalued, and other concerns may matter more than legislative impact by the U.S Congress. For example, BABA is a tech company in QQQ, but as a Chinese company it sure isn't going to impacted much by U.S. tax legislation. We can just ignore it.

However, a U.S. company like NFLX which is a bit overpriced and very exposed to a tax-cut rollback, is an excellent bear trade for a Democratic Senate scenario (especially if corporate tax increases start being mentioned). While MSFT, which is slightly under-valued and also exposed to tax increases, may be a good trade against a Democratic Senate.

&nbsp;
  
**Information about the races to consider:**

* In the November General election:
	* Perdue (R) won **49.7 percent** of the vote, while Ossoff (D) won **47.9 percent**. In other words, Ossoff substantially underperformed Biden.
	* The Republican candidates (Loeffler + Collins) won a combined **49.4 percent**, while the Democratic candidates (Warnock et al) won a combined **48.4 percent**.
	* **These are both substantial leads for the incumbent Republican Senators.**
* What the ""reputable"" polls say about Jan. 5:
	* Republican-leaning **Trafalgar Group** (""most accurate pollster of 2016""), which had Trump up 3-4% in its November poll, has now pegged **both the Democratic candidates leading slightly in its late December poll.**
	* Democratic-leaning Survey-USA (which has pretty accurate polling) had Biden up 1-2% in its last general election poll, is now predicting **a Democratic sweep** of both Senate seats
	* Poll to Watch: AJC/UGA, with polling by UGA Professor Trey Hood (the most accurate major poll for Georgia this year). **This will be released soon.**
* Trump has been calling the runoff ""invalid"", which might mean some of his supporters could boycott the election.
* The Rev. Raphael Warnock is currently in divorce proceedings, and was recently accused by his wife of running over her foot with his car. Watch for whether this gains any traction (or at least enough to sway swing voters)


**The plays:**

- If you expect **both Democratic Senate candidates to sweep** (both 2%+), then AGGRESSIVELY short QQQ, NFLX, CME, and long green energy + industrials (e.g. etfs like TAN and Solar stocks like ENPH). I would buy weekly Jan. 8 FD puts.
* If you expect **both Democratic Senate candidates to win** (both 0.5%+), short QQQ, NFLX, CME. I would buy puts for Jan. 15/22, since the counting might drag on a few days.
* If you expect **Republicans to comfortably hold at least one seat**, long QQQ (specifically NFLX, FB, and MSFT) for Jan. 15. An OTM bear put spread is recommended, but calls should be fine.
* If you expect **Republicans to sweep**, long QQQ and short green energy for Jan. 15. Use synthetic long options strategies if you can, as those are not affected by vega contraction.
* If you expect it to be **nail-bitingly close**, and unclear whether Republicans can hold at least one seat (think month-long recount), long vega on QQQ, e.g. NFLX with a bearish tilt. This would be buying OTM puts, or buying a medium-term strangle. 
* If you expect Trump to still be President on Jan 22 following the events of Jan. 6, aggressively short SPY and long MAGA because a civil war is probably coming.



**FAQ:**

**Q: What is the expected outcome?**  
A: Republicans win, but there is enough uncertainty that you can definitely make money.

**Q: Why bother trading an election?**  
A: This is largely a binary event. A candidate either wins or they don't. This beats trading earnings, as often we could get the earnings result right, but still get cucked by guidance. Moreover, as shown by what has been happening in recent years, the market is often no longer sure of the outcome.

**Q: Why is NFLX a particularly good short in the event of a Democratic sweep?**  
A: Netflix has a fairly simple business model. Its value is dependent on the expected number of subscribers, the monthly price they pay minus the server cost per subscriber, the amount of its business costs to produce shows, and the tax rate. So let's go through these one by one:

* Unlike when it was still a growing company, or at the start of the pandemic, it's unlikely for NFLX to suddenly see unexpected explosive increases in its subscriber base in the short term. 
* Moreover, they only recently increased prices a while back, so it's fairly unlikely for them to announce price increases within the next two weeks. 
* Their costs are unlikely to change drastically, since show production budgets are generally fixed. 
* As a company with a low worker count, you won't see any Congressperson arguing for tax carveouts or subsidies in the way automakers or airlines would. Sure, when they produce shows, there is an economic benefit to certain communities at places where shows, but shows are always temporarily (~3 seasons) and tax subsidies are generally done by local governments, not federal.
* As a largely B2C company, they can't structure their revenue to take advantage of tax loopholes that companies with B2B segments can. Indeed, this was why the corporate tax cuts benefitted them so much, and why a tax raise will hurt them.",123,0.91

2021-01-11 21:53:53,Post #2 Tuesday: I have a discount trading bot which gives out daily/hourly discounts for the stock market. Here‚Äôs what the bot stated under discounted companies...,"Tuesday, 12 January 2021

*Live Updates*

&#x200B;

**First Post:**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuwg1e/i\_have\_a\_discount\_trading\_bot\_which\_gives\_out/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuwg1e/i_have_a_discount_trading_bot_which_gives_out/)

&#x200B;

**Background:**

* My discount bot to help /r/wallstreetbets. It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.
* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.
* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.
* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.
* There are a lot of SPY500/""boomer"" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.
* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.
* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement
* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only
* This is a one man bot.

&#x200B;

**Bot Overview**:

It's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits.

&#x200B;

**Key:**

* Pharma companies are very risky.
* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.
* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.
* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).
* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.
* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.
* Take the ""Calls"" as very discounted, and ""Potentially A Call"" as somewhat discounted.
* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.
* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.
* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.

Some Unusual Options Activity caught my eye from Friday for this week.  I typically like to scan the prior Friday on the weekend, so I figured I‚Äôd share what I was looking at in case it gives you confirmation bias or an idea. 

*REMEMBER: UOA IS AN EDUCATED GUESSING GAME WHERE YOU ARE TRYING TO STAY ABOVE 50%, AND HAVE A FEW AMAZING BAGGERS HERE AND THERE. DO NOT YOLO WHALES*

**The way I‚Äôll break this down is by laying out my..**

**C choices:** Options activity that is intriguing, but seems like there is a strong possibility it could be a hedge, a sell the news event, isn't confirmed once I do more research, or hasn't been called out by Unusual Whales.  No precise formula. 

**B choices:** Ones I am pretty down to hop on, but need to see more.  I might be waiting for a dip, a related news event to play out, or this is one I feel could go against me big if it's an institutional hedge because of its Greeks. 

**A choices:** Shit I will likely buy right at the open, fits into what my thought process on a sector generally has been, and is simply a ticker I like.  
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

**C choices some whales bought:**

**FSLR and SPWR: Somebody is betting solar**

[UOA cluster example for both](https://i.imgur.com/5BzcmaV.jpg)
**FSLR**: underlying=96.85 **Order**: 110c 1/22 (IV 63.98%)

**SPWR**: underlying= 31.96 **Orders**: 33 and 37c 1/22

**Unusual Whales Alert:** FSLR no/SPWR YES 

**Earnings Reports**: Mid February

**Why I like it:** Solar cooled down a little bit after the Biden-stonk frenzy to start off the week.  ICLN, EV, etc could just be refueling, and aren't necessarily done running.

**Why I don‚Äôt like it:** Falling knives, and could still be finding the bottom of it's channel.  It had a hell of a run, and hopping in now feels greedy.  The volume on these orders is also low, which can be a coinflip as to what it means.  Sometimes 600-1,000 volume is the sweet spot, but

**IV and Greeks [SPWR greeks]:** shitty theta (you‚Äôre giving back almost 20% of premium price each day on the 1/29c) and IV at or near the money is already about 100% by this point.  The only upside to straight buying a call is playing the IV/Vega on Joe Biden's inauguration speech

**News confirmation and catalyst(s):** Biden's inauguration speech could lay out a great renewable energy plan that gives the whole sector a boost.  Last week people played weed, energy and EV in hopes that his Thursday speech would touch on these things--there is a much higher likelihood his inauration speech will.  Also, [huge news about the Keystone pipeline came out this weekend ](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55709261), and I don't know if this means uppies or downies for other oil companies, since big oil is trying to appeal by saying they'll switch sources. 

**Position**: Waiting to see how Keystone decision fallout hits them tomorrow morning.  If there is a significant dip I'll probably buy it for some 1/29 SPWR calls Wednesday morning and dump with a swiftness after inauguration.

**B choices**:

[**PEPüöÄüöÄ** underlying=141.39 **Orders**: 152.50 2/12c (IV 20.74%), 143c 1/22 (IV 16%)](https://i.imgur.com/67bZ71V.jpg)

**Unusual Whales**: No alert

**Earnings Report**: February 11th

**Why I kinda like it:** Didn't see many KO calls around, but saw the PEP calls; that contrast made the order stand out to me as more than a sector/industry bet.  The fact that the ER is one day before the 2/12 call expiration makes me like this play because I can pick up some IV along the way for what feels like a very oversold tech stalwart.  

**[IV and the Greeks:** Looks good to me, no major caution flags.  BUT, the bid/ask spread is a little wide.  This partially keeps it at C level; I‚Äôll probably put in a low bid, forget it, and see if the price action during the day gets the order filled.

**News confirmation and catalyst(s):**On Friday Lebron James announced he‚Äôs switching his KO sponsorship to a PEP sponsorship--which probably played into this UOA.  Looking into this more, I saw that it's an energy drink play and he's now attached to Mountain Dew's Rise energy drink.  Maybe PEP gets some price upgrades since people saw how much of a beast MNST has traditionally been, maybe this starts some conversation around the sector as a whole on CNBC, or maybe neither of those things happen.  BUT, with a relatively safe stock making a big name play leading into earnings, I'm willing to lose a little theta for a week to see if anything plays out.

**Position**: A relatively safe PEP 145c 2/12 while I play the waiting game for a week or so and reevaluate.  If it's smooth sailing, likely hold for a bit into the earnings run and sell before.

**FBüöÄüöÄ**: [Underlying= 251.36 / b: 252.50c, 257c 1/22, others (IV: 38% for 1/22, ~50% for 1/29)](https://i.imgur.com/gGXVZTA.jpg)

**Unusual Whale alert**: No

**Earnings Report**: 1/27

**Why I like it:** Welcome to earnings season for big tech, and FB is a steal right here.  They‚Äôve been pummelled, fairly or unfairly, in the ""censorship"" aftermath and is at a great level to bounce...you can't cuck the Zuck.  I have been seeing Fb calls with their own hedges trickle in like this since Wednesday and Thursday nonstop--there was some bad What's App backlash to their new privacy policy, but if anything that will be a tastier dip for Monday entry that is to be bought. 

**IV and the greeks:** slightly elevated IV because ER is coming, but fine.  Still plenty of room for an upward trajectory on IV/Vega.  The premium for 1/29 is a tad bit pricey, so if you can't afford that I'd look at a vertical call spread capping at 255 if you're going to play it with a close expiration.

**News confirmation and catalyst(s):** What's App issue is a potential albatross for tomorrow, but I do believe this will be a relatively smooth upward earning trajectory.  Also, their Oculus 2 demand numbers are going be through the roof and has great meme potential.  I don't usually hold through ER, but I may keep a lotto for this.  Been hovering around MA200, ready to bounce bounce.

**Position:** FB 1/29 255c, FB 2/19 260c

**DVN üöÄüöÄüöÄ**: underlying= 19.57 / **Orders**: 19.50, 20c, 21.50 1/22, many others with exp. from now to May. (IV high, around 100% on ATM weeklies) 
[DVN UOA](https://i.imgur.com/VL7iirc.jpg)

**Unusual Whales alert**: Yes

**Earnings Report:** Feb 16th

**Why I like it:** I've been seeing it pop up so much in clusters I can't ignore it any Longer. The volume has been intense in the whole sector.  [This Barron's article confirmed the activity I've been around energy.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/why-energy-could-have-a-tesla-like-2021-51610744972)  They compare it to TSLA--yes, TSLA.

**IV and the greeks**: IV is getting a bit high because of the overall energy spike, but I have confidence it's heading higher.  The bid/ask spread is problematic, though.  Will enter low and hope the order gets bought on a dip.

**News confirmation and catalyst(s):** aside from the call activity and the Barron's article pump, we have the inauguration for Biden to lay out a true vision for energy.  Early indications are that while solar, EV, etc are the hot names there is a place for truly evolving big oil companies.  They also just completed a merger on January 7th. Plus we have a nice dip tomorrow as an entry point with the Keystone news

**Positions**:  This is one that you buy LEAPS or monthlies on-- I'm looking at **2/19 121.5c and 3/19 121.5c **but I fully acknowledge that the bid/ask spread is a bitch at the moment.

**A list:**

[EDIT üöÄüöÄüöÄ](https://i.imgur.com/hgjrLgU.jpg): underlying = 76.14 / **Order**: 1/22 85c (IV 116%) 

**Why I Like It:** Ever since I missed the NIO/PLUG everything EV launch a couple months back, I've been looking for the next industry to go off.  Energy is one of my choices, the other is whatever the fuck is going on with Gene Editing.  Genetically constructed super-babies, so hot right now. I know ARKG exists as well, I consider that a part of this play too. 

**IV and the Greeks:** Unideal for the short term, as under 100% is a general rule of thumb, but I really like this as a long term hold--so much so that I'm going to recommend the S word here (ssssssshares).

**Confirmation and catalyst(s):**  [Barron's came out with this piece over the weekend,](https://www.barrons.com/articles/with-rare-speed-gene-editing-emerges-as-biotechs-new-cutting-edge-51610655079) which is part of what I'm sure that whale was chasing. 

>While gene-editing start-ups will lose money during years of clinical trials, it‚Äôs hard to say the stocks are overvalued. If their one-time interventions can cure diseases that otherwise require chronic treatment‚Äîor lack any treatment at all‚Äîthen the stocks will fly. 

**Position**: Opening up two LEAPs if I can get a dip so the 1/20/22 ask is only around 2,300.  Will chase on a 2/5 77 because the bid/ask spread on that strike is (relatively) reasonable and it feels doable. If this one is pricey for you consider call debit spreads.

**Two interesting trends from Friday UOA that I‚Äôm trying to connect some dots on:**

[1) Cruiseline puts were everywhere](https://i.imgur.com/AOuseNk.jpg)

I saw this enough that it made me think.  My hunch was that a lot of bad COVID recovery-stonk news is coming during inauguration (plus global trends).  That contrasted a little with the second interesting trend...

[2) Vaccines all got Unusual call options at various times](https://i.imgur.com/Z1AfJuF.jpg)
I saw MRNA got some UK upgrade attention today--maybe that was some of the reason, maybe that was none of the reason, but interesting nonetheless.

I checked Unusual Whales to see if they have any cruise alerts and they had the opposite of the orders I saw--a CCL 1/29 call alerted.  They also had MRNA 2/5 145 calls.  I'm going to stay away from the cruise puts, and probably go with some MRNA and NVAX 2/5 calls, slightly OTM depending where we open up.  It seems like the cruise puts were a hedge for a good week for vaccines. 

**Open Interest change notables**:

1) **Oil** saw huge OI increases for January and Feb expirations (XOM, PBR, etc).

2) **Uber** had huge OI increase for 2/19 both calls and puts.  Earning are 2/10

3) **F** and **GM** having obvious increases from their big splashes

4) **SRNE** had serious volume as well and lots of sporadic call buys

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

**Other options I saw I liked:** **BZUN 2/19 45c** **FEYE** 1/22 25c I will play as a 2/5, **WKHS** 25c 2/5

**Positions:**

**PEP** 145c 2/12

**FB** 1/29 255c, FB 2/19 260c

**DVN** 2/19 21.5c and 3/19 121.5c

**EDIT**: 2/5 77c

**INO/NVAX/MRNA** take your pick (Cruise puts hedge)
**EDIT: JUST NOTICED A 170c 1/22 NVAX I MISSED**

**VXX**: 1/29 18c and 19c. bigly hedged for inauguration shenigans. 

*waiting for a dip for some of these because I‚Äôm
Nervous about Thursday.* 

**TLDR**:
Energy, Gene editing, and Vaccines were all trending on Friday UOA.  FB has been getting a lot of call activity as well ahead of earnings.  PEP looks good for a run too on the heels of Lebron James signing pre-earnings.

2021-01-09 12:59:57,Case for TWTR Puts,"# Twitter Puts are the logical hedge at the moment

# 

Let me explain why:  


**1. Twitter has just provoked the eyes of Congress in an unspeakably stupid way**  
Twitter has for years attempted to fend off Congress by claiming that they're fundamentally neutral, and their Terms of Service don't have real ramifications to speech. By suspending hundreds of prominent conservatives, including POTUS, they've now declared a partisan war which, I can guarantee you, House Democrats are going to be asking ""why didn't you do this before?"". I think the Republican talking points are going to be obvious, but if there was ever a reason to repeal Section 230, this is it.  


**2. Twitter's fundamentals suck, and everyone knows it**  
The straight fundamentals of Twitter are terrible. They've got a stagnated user base, and by kicking off Trump, they've provoked an exodus which will almost definitely show up in their Feb 9th earnings. At the moment, puts are cheap, as they've been on a bit of a tear upwards. . . but I don't see this continuing. They could lose a lot of revenue from their recent actions, but I don't see anyone hopping ***onto Twitter because they did what they did. This is a net-loss action.***   


**3. Puts are cheap**   


If there was ever a good reason to go against Twitter, it's that puts are super cheap at the moment. No one could have foreseen that the Trump rally would go this way. I work at one of the social media companies (not Twitter), and trust me, it caught everyone off-guard. This decision has fundamentally reshaped the investment thesis around social media; non-US dominated versus US dominated / regulatory and anti-trust risk, etc etc etc. Puts are cheap as fuck. I recently paid for some puts (5 contracts of TWTR $48.50 Put 1/15 +  10 contracts of TWTR $40.00 Put 2/26), and it's discounted for sure.  


**4. In summary:**  
Ya'll are smart enough to see that this recent action is bullshit. I'm willing to say that this is actually the beginning of the end for Twitter. $FB will last longer because of Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus. Reddit has a decent trajectory, but monetization is a bit of an issue. Pinterest is actually the biggest dark-horse of the bunch, though I'm personally bullish on Indian stocks atm.

2020-07-07 09:56:35,$FB - Goldman report indicates mixed metrics for May,"Goldman published a report last night with data from comScore showing US mobile and multiplatform internet usage for May.

* FB's overall U.S. mobile #unique visitors# from browsers and apps were 206.5mn in May or flat m/m (vs. 1% in April) and +3% yoy. Time spent across Facebook was -6% m/m in May, vs. +10% m/m in April and March. Average minutes per unique visitor per day +16% yoy, (vs. +24% yoy in April).

* Standalone Facebook.com unique visitors were 196m in May, flat m/m vs. slightly down m/m in April. Total daily minutes on Facebook.com -8% m/m in May, after +29% m/m in April.

Caveat: comScore implemented some enhancements and methodology changes that impact these metrics for January 2016, January 2017, October 2017, May 2018, and March 2019. Facebook‚Äôs own app updates have also impacted the data collected by comScore, most notably in October 2015 and February 2016.

A: there‚Äôs a much cheaper stock with better tech.

Here‚Äôs where MVIS comes in. MVIS has been working on Lidar tech for 20 years and has a robust patent portfolio. They have both an AR vertical and an autonomous driving vertical. 

MVIS has been confirmed as the key creator of the chip that powers the Microsoft Hololense 2. Look it up it‚Äôs dope. The US military‚Äôs IVAS program is gonna be buying up a shit ton of these. The Hololense will have more future versions with the realistic end goal of these smart glasses replacing smart phones. There is currently an AR smart glasses war going on between MSFT, FB, AAPL, and GOOG. 

And the Lidar for autonomous vehicles? The CEO of the company specialized in this field at his prior role at Google and said MVIS‚Äôs tech will disrupt the market. The autonomous Lidar sample will be ready by APRIL OF 2021 which is way sooner than the other Lidar companies. 

The stock has been on an absolute tear lately. The company has said they‚Äôre exploring strategic alternatives which includes the sale of the company and there are several very interested parties.

2021-02-04 17:56:06,Livent (LTHM) is great LT play on EV,"Livent is scheduled to report 4Q earnings on February 20th.

**Investment Thesis**

Livent‚Äôs primary source of revenue is lithium, a key component for electric batteries. Livent is one of the five major suppliers of lithium worldwide and the only pure-play provider in North America. We view Livent as well positioned to leverage the global transition from internal combustion engines (ICE) to electric vehicles (EV), due to its significant technology expertise, global supply chain, and partnerships with OEMs, including Tesla. Hence, Livent‚Äôs premium valuation accurately reflects the company‚Äôs ability to gain share in a growing market driven by a favorable regulatory environment and an increasing sense of corporate responsibility.

**Key Catalysts:**

\- *Favorable regulatory environment will drive EV adoption.* China is the largest and fastest growing market for EVs, followed by Europe. China recently extended tax exemptions for EVs while Europe enacted the European Climate Law with the goal of making Europe climate neutral by 2050. We expect the Biden administration to pursue similar policies, albeit of a more incremental nature. Additionally, corporations are increasingly adopting energy efficient targets as part of a greater awareness of their social responsibility. We view the favorable regulatory environment as the primary catalyst for EV adoption and one that is largely sustainable regardless of political and social changes.

\- *Livent is well positioned to leverage the growing market for nickel-rich batteries.* Within the electric battery market, nickel-rich batteries are generally preferred for high performance EVs. Nickel-rich batteries require lithium hydroxide, which Livent produces through a two-stage chemical process. Livent estimates the market share for nickel-rich batteries should increase from about 25% today to 75% by the end of the decade.

\- *Recent demand uptick suggests pricing likely to recover.* Lithium pricing had been under pressure due to a supply glut heading into 2020 which the pandemic exacerbated by reducing demand. (Lithium pricing contracts are long-term although lithium carbonate pricing has declined more than 50% since the beginning of the pandemic.) Industry experts currently estimate lithium pricing needs to rise by roughly 10% to incentivize suppliers to expand capacity. We believe this scenario is likely to occur given some recent encouraging signs, including robust October sales of EVs in China and Europe.

\- *Scale and Argentina operations offer relative cost advantage.* Regardless of the trajectory of the pricing rebound, however, Livent has a relative cost advantage due to its brine-based Argentina mine, which is more cost efficient than spodumene mines [\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn1). Additionally, Livent is vertically integrated enabling it to capture value along every step of the supply chain. Longer-term, lithium suppliers are pursuing alternatives such as the potential to mine lithium from clay and recycling existing batteries to insulate margins from global disruptions. Although supply may eventually be impacted by new entrants such as Bolivia and India, there are significant political and logistical hurdles which will need to be overcome.

**Company Description**

Livent is a pure play lithium company headquartered in Philadelphia, PA. The company went public in 2018 as a spin-off from FMC Corporation. Livent extracts lithium from its plant in Argentina and then converts the metal into lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide, which are the critical components for electric batteries. Analysts forecast Livent to generate $400mn in revenue in 2021 and EBITDA margins in the high-teens.

Livent recently extended its supply agreement with Tesla through 2021. We expect this contract to be renewed past the current term. Livent also entered into a joint venture with private equity firm Pallinghurst Resources to buy Canada's lithium projects, which are spodumene based. Through the JV, New Nemaska Lithium, Livent will own 25% of the economics, which should provide economies of scale for its North American operations.

**Industry and Market Opportunity**

Lithium is an alkali metal found in natural substances such as rocks. Lithium is extremely light, a property which makes it ideal for storing energy. In its pure form, lithium actually has an energy density equivalent to gasoline although a typical EV car battery has a much lower density due to the additional inputs required such as casings and electrolyte fluid. In addition to Livent, there are four other global players of which Livent is one of only two providers in North America.

The lithium opportunity is primarily tied to growth in electric batteries although grid storage is emerging as a secondary use case. (Despite the attention paid to electric cars, electric buses are actually further along the adoption curve due to scale benefits.) Battery sales accounted for 65% of global lithium demand in 2019 and analysts are forecasting this percentage to continue to rise steadily. Given lithium is a commodity, the only limiting supply factor is a price high enough to warrant mining. A third party research firm, Fortune Business Insights, estimates that the global [lithium market](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=rnOqyS-E5qWpEUFLoMeh3w3gSgw-u8NK1t-DXVE8CZI_qSX_FG7DaFbNfwOY1GCj8-hZsRn-ezuSitWBnrb4WpkSApmUiWBUpkd_X_Ms4WGIMiFgBeI_XOUAv_u0vuyiAnFinChKftDQSSS8I1GZbg==) opportunity will reach $8.24 billion by the end of 2027, up from $4.1 billion in 2019 (9.2% CAGR) while demand is expected to increase almost tenfold over the next decade.

Deloitte and IHS Markit forecast EVs to account for approximately 30% of total passenger car and light duty vehicles by 2030.

**Financials and Valuation**

Approximately 80% of Livent‚Äôs revenue is generated from sales of battery-grade lithium hydroxide and butyllithium. Energy storage is the primary use case for Livent‚Äôs batteries, including rechargeable batteries for EVs, portable electronics and grid storage systems. Approximately 65% of Livent‚Äôs sales are from Asia, followed by North America (20%) and Europe (15%).

3Q review: Revenue improved sequentially as demand slowly returned although margins and Adjusted EPS missed consensus due to COVID-related costs. The company did not provide 4Q guidance although management noted volumes should continue to improve.

4Q and 2021 Outlook: Industry experts were originally forecasting a flattish year for global lithium demand but have since revised their 2020 estimates upward to reflect an uptick in EV sales late this year. Hence, we believe there is upside to 4Q consensus. For 2021, analysts are forecasting revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of $400 million and $75 million, respectively. Given the required capacity demands, Livent is not expected to be cash-flow positive for the foreseeable future.

2021-02-05 10:56:29,I love those people which came for quick buck,"Those which bought high, sold low and now they are negative AF instead taking their toilet paper hands and getting the f out of here.

I came about 3/4 year ago. Lurking, being jealous of people throwing tens, or hundreds of thousands away on yolo plays, while my salary is 1500$ a month. I am 22 and I am currently at red 1032$. I have left 600$ from my 2 years of hard savings (bag of GME and 2 AAPL). Nobody will give me back that money here, no one gives as hit how much I fucked myself (did kinda a lot), even if that would be like lunch money for them. But I took the risk and now I am holding either to make buck, or sink with the ship and regret hopping in the casino.

Stop being mad because you bought lotto ticket, threw it away without scratching the last number on it. This sub was something I never experienced before, when I joined. But now its worse than my FB, or Instagram main page. 

As far as I am aware, the posts I saw years back, this was always casino. 

We will be at least bit smarter apes on next Tuesday, because on this GME there are actually some technicals.

Spamming does not help.

Hold, or if you can't take it, leave and hold.

2021-01-21 14:56:28,"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market-driving news (Jan 21, 2021 GME euphoria edition)","* The market was a bit mixed today compare to yesterday's nonstop buying - but tech continued its skyrocket after yesterday's bullish inauguration run. AAPL extended their rally to close the day up 3.67% to $136.87, nearing ATH once again thanks to some more positive comments from analysts this morning. Morgan Stanley up their AAPL PT from $144 to $152, while Bernstein notes Apple's strong iPhone 12 demand cycle. In other big tech moves, FB closed up 2% to $272 as Evercore ups their PT from $320 to $355; AMZN trimmed their earlier morning gains but still closed the day up 1.34% to $3,300; finally, after running up 6% yesterday, GOOGL retreated from a morning high that almost touched ATH to close the day at 0.22%.

* GME euphoria roars along unabated as WSB continues to go all-in on the gaming retailer. With intraday moves of over 13%, GME is as volatile as ever. Shares initially traded red in the morning but soon rally to as high as $42 when it became apparent Citron's video was postponed yet again (damn hAxOr!), but the stock soon went red once the video was uploaded. Suffice to say, Citron's video on YouTube immediately accumulated thousands of dislikes while not revealing anything material that the market wouldn't know about already - and shares recovered after an initial dive. Through the rest of the day, shares bounced from low $40s to the ~$42 sell wall, but eventually broke through during power hour and closed the day up 9.99% to $43 - a relatively strong bullish close considering GME hasn't closed above $40+ since last week's big pump. Support appears to be around $35-$37 and resistance is around $42-$43.

* Morning numbers had jobless claims falling slightly by 26k to 900k for the week ending in Jan 16 with consensus being 910k. Housing Starts saw another strong month with a 5.8% increase to 1.67m in Dec. Finally, Philly Fed manufacturing index showed a strong uptick with numbers at 26.5 vs the consensus of 12, representing an 11-month high. 

* Airlines took a beating today with UAL leading the charge. With steeper than expected rev miss from their ER, UAL closed the day down -5.7% to $42.69. DAL closed down -2.28%, JBLU -2.37%, LUV -0.91%, and AAL closed down -2.10%.

* In an unexpected move, INTC released their earnings early before the market closed and the stock traded with strength to close the day up 6.46% to $62.46. After digesting the numbers, shares retreated in AH to a current -3% to around $60. INTC reports Q4 EPS of $1.52 while consensus was $1.10 (hence the pump minutes before close) and they also projected Q1 EPS of $1.10 while consensus is at $0.93. The blue-chip semiconductor company is also upping its quarterly cash dividend by 5% (boomers love their dividend). The sector performed well today with AMD up 3% and NVDA up 3.75%. As with before, AMD's AH is a reverse of INTC with Su Bae showing boomer INTC what's up. AMD is up another 2.8% AH to $94.10.

* IBM took a heavy beating, with AH currently at -6.4% to $123 as the large IT company reports fell short of the street's expectation. While adjusted Q4 EPS was $2.07 beating the consensus of $1.79, revenue was $20.37 bil vs $20.67 expected. Especially troubling was IBM's cloud segment, producing 6.84 bil instead of the consensus of 7.18 bil.

* In WSB meme stock land BB traded red for most of the day but edged out a flat close to 0.47% to $12.85 (though it is retreating again in AH as of writing at -1.87%). ICLN closed up 4.41% to $32.66, filling the gap from last Friday's sell-off. Meanwhile, MT continues being pressured and closed the day at -1.49% to $23.

* More notable ER movers: STX reported ER and while numbers were decent, shares are retreating AH to -4.83%. WDC follows suit AH to -2.45%. TAL, the Chinese after school online learning platform, rocketed up 15% for the day after reporting a strong quarter. Shares of other Chinese ADRs in the sector also performed strongly with GSX (a Citron short) up 11.62% and EDU up 6.95% for the day.

* The DOW closed down 0.04% or -12 pts, Nasdaq up 0.55% or 73 pts, SPX up 0.03% or 1 pt (look at all those gains), and RUT close down -0.89% or -19 pts.

* Notable numbers tomorrow: PMI at 9:45 AM ET with existing home sales soon to follow at 10 AM ET.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 1st, 2021.

# **Wall Street braces for bumpy trading in the week ahead as the GameStop short squeeze unfolds - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/wall-street-braces-for-bumpy-trading-in-the-week-ahead-as-the-gamestop-short-squeeze-unfolds.html)**
*****
> Earnings news from Amazon and Alphabet, the important January jobs report and Washington‚Äôs discussion of stimulus could all be important to markets in the week ahead, but none of it is likely to get more attention than the short squeezes driven by retail investors.
*****
> Stocks had a rocky week, with the S&P 500 down 3.3% to 3,714. The S&P was down 1.1% for January, its first negative month since October and a warning for the year, according to the old Wall Street adage.
*****
> ‚ÄúWe were due for some type of decline. We‚Äôve been straight up since October. It‚Äôs not unusual that we‚Äôre backing off a bit,‚Äù said Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities.
*****
> Trading could remain bumpy in the coming week, as the S&P 500 struggles to hold above 3,716 its 50-day moving average and a key technical level.
*****
> ‚ÄúThis is the first time we‚Äôre at the 50-day moving average since early November,‚Äù said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a level we haven‚Äôt seen in a while and it‚Äôs an important first line in the sand of whether the market uses this as a pivot spot to bounce again.‚Äù
*****
> ‚ÄúThe buy the dip mentality doesn‚Äôt die easy, but if you break that [50-day], that portends something else,‚Äù he said.
*****
> Massocca and others see little impact on the broader market from the phenomena of retail investors piling into stocks that are being shorted by big investors. Fueled by no fee trading, retail investors created a flurry of trading in GameStop and other heavily shorted names, like AMC Entertainment. If the stocks rise, in theory, the firms that are short sellers will have to buy stock to cover, and that activity could drive the price even higher in a so-called short squeeze.
*****
> GameStop was the poster child for that trade this past week. GameStop shares closed 68% higher on Friday, bringing their gain for the week to 400%. The retailer‚Äôs shares hit a high of $483 on Jan. 28.
*****
> ‚ÄúThis is somewhat isolated,‚Äù Massocca said of trading in GameStop and other shorts. He said it may not be a phenomena for that long since there aren‚Äôt that many heavily shorted stocks. ‚ÄúI think they may be hunting new names.‚Äù
*****
> The short squeeze story has garnered broad interest, in the general news media and from Washington.
*****
> Lawmakers from both parties are eager to look into the fact that Robinhood and other online brokers restricted trading in the hottest short names when trading was frenzied. Robinhood said it was responding to SEC rules on net capital requirements and clearinghouse deposits that brokers have to comply with.
*****
> ‚ÄúThis was the busiest week for earnings reported with 82% of the companies reported better than expected earnings. It‚Äôs a really good quarter, but obviously overshadowed by the short squeeze news,‚Äù said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management.
*****
> He said some of the biggest tech names have been lagging, like Apple and Microsoft.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe combination of demanding valuations and short squeeze news has overshadowed a really good performance of corporate earnings so far,‚Äù Grohowski said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre constructive on the market. Fundamentals do look encouraging to us.‚Äù
*****
> Strategists have expected a pullback in the first part of the year, and many say it would become a buying opportunity. Hedge funds did sell long positions in the past week, but firms like Morgan Stanley and Barclays say the de-leveraging is not likely to have a big impact on stocks.
*****
> But for investors who end up buying in at the end of the short squeezes, they could feel some pain.
*****
> ‚ÄúI do think this isn‚Äôt going to end well,‚Äù said Grohowski. ‚ÄúThese kind of one way trades they don‚Äôt end well particularly for those that come later to the party.‚Äù
*****
> ‚ÄúI think this will be one of those,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúGameStop is not worth what it is trading for today. I do believe at the end of the day the value of a company is important and it‚Äôs going to be driven by fundamentals. These dislocations and distortions of value, they will correct and many will be hurt by that.‚Äù
*****
> But Grohowski said it‚Äôs encouraging that the surge in retail activity was driven by younger investors.
*****
> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve wanted for some time for this younger generation to be more interested in the financial markets and equity investing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI know a lot of experienced market participants were not anticipating it being this way. It‚Äôs not just a one time kind of distortion.
*****
> ‚ÄúI think this is thought-provoking in terms of a way a younger generation might be looking at investing, by their rules, not the rules of the traditional market participants,‚Äù Grohowski added.
*****
> He expects the January employment report to get some attention Friday, and it should be weaker with just 50,000 to 60,000 jobs added.
*****
> He said the markets will also monitor the progress of stimulus discussions in Washington, as valuations have risen on expectations of a package coming soon. President Joe Biden has proposed $1.9 trillion in spending, but Republicans are not in agreement.

> # How Stocks Perform in a President‚Äôs First Year

> 2021 kicks off the first year of a new four-year presidential cycle. One of the most popular questions we‚Äôve received lately is how have stocks performed historically during this political year.

> For starters, the S&P 500 Index historically has gained 6.8% per year during the first year of the four-year presidential cycle, but stocks have done better when the president was re-elected than when someone new occupied the White House. This makes sense, as a new president could bring new policies and potential uncertainty. Additionally, stocks do better during years three and four under a new president, while they are much weaker early in the cycle.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.27.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, breaking down all the quarters of the four-year presidential cycle shows that the first quarter of the first year in the cycle is one of only two quarters with a negative average return.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.27.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Bigger picture, historically the fourth quarter of the year has been the strongest of the year, with the first quarter the second best on average. Don‚Äôt forget, the third quarter is usually a weak one. Please note, below is for all years, not just the first year of the cycle.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.27.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

> We will take a closer look at February returns next week on the blog, but it is worth noting that when a new party is in power in the White House, historically stocks have struggled from late January until early March. ‚ÄúIt is interesting, but from around the time of the inauguration to several weeks out, stocks tend to be pretty weak,‚Äù according to LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúIt may be as simple as new leadership could bring with it new policies and added uncertainty‚Äù.

> # Will GameStop Stop The Bull Market?

> ‚ÄúIn the short term, the market is a popularity contest. In the long term, the market is a weighing machine.‚Äù -Warren Buffett

> The incredible action from some of the most heavily shorted names has investors everywhere wondering what it all means? GameStop (GME) specifically has taken the country‚Äôs imagination by storm, as the stock started the year under $20 per share and this morning nearly hit $500.

> Please note, we aren‚Äôt allowed to discuss individual equities, and in no way are we recommending any stocks in this blog, but from a bigger perspective, what is happening here? Basically, individual investors are using message boards like Reddit to find some of the most shorted stocks, then they all pile in at the same time, forcing large institutions to cover their shorts, and thus producing massive buying pressure.

> LPL Research doesn‚Äôt think these parabolic moves reflect an overall unhealthy market, but institutions covering shorts at sizable losses may be removing capital from some big cap names. ‚ÄúWhile these developments could be another sign of excessive optimism in certain segments of the equity markets, we do not believe they represent a sign of a broader market bubble or indicate a major correction is forthcoming,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget, overall market breadth is extremely healthy and the credit markets are functioning just fine‚Äîwe don‚Äôt see a repeat of 1999 like some are claiming.‚Äù

> Lastly, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, after a 72% rally in the S&P 500 Index (and more in small caps and the Nasdaq), maybe it is simply time for a break. After all, the current bull market has tracked almost perfectly the start of the 1982 and 2009 bull markets thus far, and both of those took a break for a few months starting around this point in the cycle.

> # Most Heavily Shorted Stocks at the End of 2020 and Now

> In the table below, we show the 20 stocks in the Russell 3000 that currently have the highest short interest as a percentage of float. It should come as no surprise that GameStop (GME) still tops that list with 122.97% of float short as of the most recent data for mid-month. That is even after a 21.36 percentage point drop from the end of 2020 when 144.34% of shares were short. It was also the most heavily shorted stock then. The runner-up is Dillard's (DDS) which currently has 83.04% of shares sold short compared to over 90% at the end of 2020. Again, despite that sizeable decline in the percentage of shares sold short, it was also the second most heavily shorted stock one month ago. Of the rest of the top 20, there are six other names with lower short interest than the end of last year. Looking across the rest of the most heavily shorted stocks, Sumo Logic (SUMO), American Well Corp (AMWL), and Sunpower (SPWR) are the stocks that have seen their short interest as a percentage of equity float rise the most. In terms of stock price performance, SPWR has been the one with the biggest rally having doubled YTD. The only other stock that has doubled YTD in this cohort has been GME.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012921-Short-2.png))**

> In the table below, we show the stocks that have seen the biggest changes in the percent of shares sold short between the end of 2020 and the most recent data as of January 15th. Those currently in the top 20 most shorted stocks are highlighted in gray. Across the entire Russell 3,000, 1,777 stocks have seen their short interest as a percent of short move lower in the two week period from the end of December to mid-January. As shown, even after the massive short squeeze that has taken place, GME is actually not the stock that has seen the biggest decline in shorts. Relay Therapeutics (RLAY) holds that title with a 22.62 percentage point decline. That is even though the stock has experienced a relatively smaller move than some of its peers. Granted, a number of other stocks like nCino (NCNO) and Berkeley Lights (BPYU) to name a few have actually moved lower so far in 2020 and have also seen their short interest decline significantly. On the other end of the spectrum, WW International (WW) has seen its short interest rise the most.

> # Funding Markets Full of Cash

> US funding markets are awash with liquidity thanks to ongoing QE purchases by the Fed and the progression of fiscal policy since the end of the year, as well as normal seasonal tailwinds that see more liquidity after year-end balance sheet constraints would roll off. Funding markets refer to collateralized, short-term lending via repo and related wholesale cash transactions.

> Government money market funds that are allowed to conduct repo operations as well as buying Treasury and Agency debt are seeing roughly typical inflows, but those come on top of record share of overall money market funds. As a result, repo rates have been plunging. The secured overnight financing rate, which tracks the volume-weighted general collateral repo rate has fallen to 3 basis points above the bottom of the Fed Funds target range. While repo rates falling below the Fed Funds target range wouldn‚Äôt be a catastrophe and some parts of the market have gotten there, it‚Äôs not in the FOMC‚Äôs interest to have funding rates trading far outside its target policy rate range on a regular basis.

> The solution already exists, of course: the NY Fed has a standing overnight reverse repo facility first introduced back in 2013 which is likely to start draining cash as investors seek higher returns than the repo markets offer. Reserve scarcity, which roll-off brought to bear in 2018 and 2019, is now reserve plenty, and so many reserves exist that the NY Fed will start draining them with reverse repos. Reserve balances will continue to grow this year thanks to QE purchases and an expected decline in the balance of the federal government's transaction account at the Federal Reserve.

> # Federal Reserve Rebukes Hawkish Rumors; Reaffirms Support

> It has been a busy past 12 months for the Federal Reserve (Fed), after the onset of the global pandemic prompted historic stimulus from monetary policymakers. With the economy showing signs of being in the early stages of expansion, some have speculated that the Fed may begin to slow the pace of its asset purchases. Recent comments from some Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members that have hinted that the Fed‚Äôs bond buying program could be reduced by the end of the year, has signaled that other policymakers may be thinking that way, too.

> Adding fuel to the speculation, the 10-year Treasury yield has been climbing, breaking above 1% for the first time since March 2020 as the economy has expanded. Meanwhile, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, breakeven inflation rates‚Äîthe yield difference between Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and nominal Treasuries‚Äîhave risen to levels not seen since 2018, suggesting that inflation expectations are heating up, although levels still remain largely benign.

2021-01-13 20:51:16,The case for $POSH to soar and reign over BECKY,"&#x200B;

[$POSH to the moon](https://preview.redd.it/kov88euxh8b61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5960482e7251c81886102864f0b88a40f1868c95)

Alright everyone. Poshmark will soon be joining the ""Becky Index"" with a much anticipated IPO tomorrow morning. While I wouldn‚Äôt define myself as a necessarily intelligent (or competent) investor, but I am very familiar with the platform and the re-commerce industry as a seller and buyer.

I‚Äôve been selling people‚Äôs used shit since high school, in an attempt to finance a previous weed addiction. Fast forward 4 years and I have still been selling people‚Äôs used shit, though now the funds are going toward monthly Model 3 payments I am underwater for. That said, I‚Äôve been selling used clothing and have completed a bit over $300k in gross sales through various ‚Äúre-commerce‚Äù platforms such as eBay, Amazon, FB Marketplace, Mercari, Grailed, and Poshmark. eBay is the most well established platform for used clothing sales and thus wins for market share, but Poshmark wins in nearly every other category- which I have broken down below.

&#x200B;

[Yes, I am one of us](https://preview.redd.it/1nroqslei8b61.jpg?width=2902&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1df27f7feea578af8e41262d689dea6c260f84fe)

Before we get started, it is important to understand what the hell $POSH is and why it is a buy below $50. Poshmark is essentially eBay, though marketed towards Millennials, Gen XYZ etc, and those who value convenience. *Poshmark is a leading social marketplace for new and secondhand style for women, men, kids, home, and more.*

The social media aspect is a bit of a spectacle, as no one really wants to socialize and add ‚ÄúPoshmark Stories‚Äù of their shit to get a sale- but this method does succeed in retaining returning customers and rewarding sellers whoa re active on the platform. Because of this, the average time spent on poshmark is 27 minutes a day, which is less than, although comparable to that of social media sites like TikTok and Instagram- rather than the likes of eBay, Depop, or Mercari. The company also turned a profit of $20.9 last year, which is bullish considering the amount of money they burn and COVID.

**Selling fees:**

Poshmark has ridiculous selling fees, although it has proven to be beneficial in respect to revenue. The platform makes money by charging a fee for every sale: 20 per cent for items more than $15, and a flat fee of $2.95 for items under $15 that are less than that. Products worth more than $500 must be sent to Poshmark for evaluation, but the average order value is $33. 20% is ridiculous, especially considering that this does not include shipping costs of the seller/buyer. All the other platforms take a standard deviation around 10%, which begs the question why the fuck do they charge so much. People complain but continue to use the platform because of the next point- shipping.

**Shipping:**

For the past few years, the platform and its social media/YouTube influences have been aggressively marketing towards stay at home mothers and teenage girls. These aren‚Äôt your typical streetwear wannabe EnTrePenUeR businessmen, and Poshmark certainly knows that. They supply USPS Priority Mail shipping labels for every. single. fucking. order. Have a 2oz necktie that would ship for $2.62 USPS first class? Fuck that. Poshmark send you a $7.11 Priority Mail label that will arrive to your buyers doorstep faster than Amazons COVID shit prime delayed delivery. While a cost deterrent for lower value items and cheap buyers, this system simplifies the selling process of needing to calculate shipping costs and having to deal with various mail carriers. Packages rarely gets lost and any lost package issues are generally covered by Poshmark or the insure USPS provides through Priority Mail.

&#x200B;

[Less shipping hassle = more time for sellers do shit like this](https://preview.redd.it/iq6b6102i8b61.jpg?width=1484&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=673b69586ea4bdf52c8965da9c89c49d8cd48c26)

$7.11 is cheaper than my Ebay rate for any priority mail, so I also give this one to Poshmark as they seem to have worked something out with USPS. For eBay, if I can shove a pair of Jeans into a Flat Rate Envelope it will cost me $7.59 to ship. Any heavier or larger clothing items cost me, on average, about $9-14. While this last part is speculation, I do believe that Poshmark does get a kickback or receive some commission from every label. The cost has risen about $2 in the past couple years, which is a higher percentile than the USPS shipping rate increase.

**Convenience:**

Buyers love convenience, and poshmark certainly does well in that regard. Poshmark is a large SoCiAl MeDiA MarKetPace, giving them access to a fuckload of your data. When you sign up, you can add the city you live in, university, job etc. You also have the ability to like and share items.

Both of these combined, allow the app to recognize who you are what what type of items you may be interested in buying. My homepage looks the same as my closet at home, shoving new items, markdowns, etc from brands I am much too familiar with.

A lot of purchases tend to be of impulse on the buyer, which is good for sellers since Poshmark doesn‚Äôt allow returns (unless fake/ruined/ not as described). I have a handful of buyers asking me to return items every week because they don‚Äôt like the color, fit, or price; I tell them to fuck off and Poshmark gets to keep the commission. For reference, my return rate on eBay is about 7% for no reason.

I just sold this Ikea Rug today that I was too lazy to return. I paid $10 for it and the buyer most likely saw the nice stock photos on their homepage and failed to crosscheck the price on IKEA. Convenience of the homepage.

**SEO:**

I study rhetoric so I have no fucking clue how to rank or asses the SEO of a company, but look for any used clothing brand and Poshmark will generally be the first to show up on google. If that doesn‚Äôt signify good SEO, idk remember I study rhetoric.

&#x200B;

[$12 selling fees for some mid-tier Nordstrom Rack jeans- you're kidding](https://preview.redd.it/twywma66i8b61.jpg?width=1474&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e1c5ca0f009d5993694492524ceb420198f34e5)

**Market share:**

In terms of Fashion and clothing APPS, I think Poshmark does fairly well. An in depth DD would reference technology, social media, and e-commerce platforms as well- but I‚Äôll just include a graph I found.

[Chart](https://preview.redd.it/h7rm9we7i8b61.jpg?width=1450&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05dcf73e82484e67a62d5df146ef327c05a0f1ae)

In terms of their presence online, I think Poshmark does the best job engaging with their users. They are constantly reposting buyers and sellers images on instagram- making it somewhat of an incentive to use the platform and engage with others in the community. I‚Äôve been posted a few times on their instagram page and story. As a seller, I‚Äôve also been invited out to drinks with some of the staff in SF. Was all food and drinks at the bar covered by Poshmark? Idk ask my Jonny Walker Blue.

&#x200B;

[They follow me on IG lol](https://preview.redd.it/rk0sby59j8b61.png?width=1617&format=png&auto=webp&s=202d187e321d43163c5a0c197284992ad3e1bdda)

I do about 5x the amount in sales on eBay, and have never engaged in any form of communication with anyone not from their Philippines call center. I understand eBay is significantly larger, but this does show that Poshmark‚Äôs ethos is something different and much appreciated in the re-commerce industry.

&#x200B;

[They probably spent $10k renting the bar for 2 hours. There was were 10 sellers, including myself](https://preview.redd.it/hj58ify9i8b61.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab39b5983c504e6440b825746dec912ecea8d34f)

**IPO:**

As a long time seller, I was offered direct offering shares which I have committed to. They were planning on $32-39 but I have been notified that the IPO price will be $42 with an offering size of 6,600,000. I‚Äôm not much of a share guy, so I will also be buying 100c leaps when they become available.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kadpoz8ci8b61.jpg?width=634&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=60d0f4976e1d916140397996f5871cb1bcd51d7e

**TLDR:** I think Poshmark is a great platform, doing very different things than traditional selling platforms. Much higher fees and seamless shipping integration makes the platform a winner. They are valued as a selling platform, but they are much more than simply just that. Can you buy Lululemon pants at $GME? No, but you can on Poshmark. I also have not proofread this post at all.

Re-commerce is covid proof. I'm going 50% $POSH and 50% $EBAY this year. Fourth quarter has been consistently the best for online clothing resellers. When they release 2020 Q4 earnings, just watch :)

Edit: Formatting is fuk. Also Poshmark opened at $102",55,0.93

Today, i found that a previous friend of mine is a hedgeboy. I found this out from a post i made on FB with how i was willing to trade my Maker skills, for some GME stock to screw over the HF. He made it clear he was against the ideas and was extremely rude, vile, and vulgar. He was once a friend that i believed was good.. but it seems his past of being born to wealth never left him. Even after he fucked up a bit, and had the daddy bank removed. 

So, i cut him out of my life today, then managed to get 2 Shares of GME. 

I now have diamond hands. One for each hand.

2021-01-14 06:55:46,Post #4 Thursday: I have a discount trading bot which gives out daily (well hourly discounts for the stock market). Here‚Äôs what the bot stated under discounted companies...,"Thursday, 14 January 2021

*Live Updates*

&#x200B;

**First Post:**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuwg1e/i\_have\_a\_discount\_trading\_bot\_which\_gives\_out/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuwg1e/i_have_a_discount_trading_bot_which_gives_out/)

&#x200B;

**Background:**

* My discount bot to help /r/wallstreetbets. It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.
* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.
* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.
* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.
* There are a lot of SPY500/""boomer"" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.
* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.
* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement
* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only
* This is a one man bot.

&#x200B;

**Bot Overview**:

It's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits. Backtesting has not been done, do not YOLO your life savings into whatever stated risking it all.  Rather use this as a side tool.

&#x200B;

**Key:**

* Pharma companies are very risky.
* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.
* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.
* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).
* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.
* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.
* Take the ""Calls"" as very discounted, and ""Potentially A Call"" as somewhat discounted.
* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.
* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.
* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.

2021-01-10 11:49:57,OAC ‚Äì A Sleeping Giant. Kylie Jenner promoted their product her Instagram,"  

Okay, I admit, I originally dismissed this stock because of the terrible DD‚Äôs previously posted about this. OAC is a blank cheque company that will be merging with HIMS & HERS.

A lot of the other DD‚Äôs have mistakenly categorized HIMS as a company that specializes in selling erectile disfunction pills, which ironically, I found as a turn off and dismissed it completely. However, I decided to give this company a second look because of the recent price action on the stock and what I found was a sleeping giant in the making. Yes, it‚Äôs true that they do sell ‚Äòboner pills‚Äô, but that‚Äôs just one product among many others (i.e. hair loss treatment, birth control, acne, etc.). What caught my attention wasn‚Äôt what they were selling, but HOW they were selling it. Take Amazon for example, which was a company that sold books originally, and expanded into other products as it grew. What made Amazon successful wasn‚Äôt what they were selling, but HOW they were selling it. 

HIMS is looking to position themselves as a Telehealth disruptor in the Healthcare space. How they are unique from any other e-commerce platform that simply sells medication is the fact that they have a unique network of physicians that will address consumer concerns. For example, a person that has concerns about their hair loss might be too self-conscious to go into a doctor‚Äôs office to get a prescription and then must take that prescription to get fulfilled at a pharmacy. The whole process is embarrassing and intimidating, and as a result, the customer might just not seek a solution all together. However, with HIMS, the customer can consult a doctor remotely, get a prescription, order his medication, and have it delivered to him all through his phone and in the comfort of his own home. This in a nutshell is what give HIMS their unique competitive advantage. 

What really attracted me to HIMS were their financials. The company has been in operation for 3 years and the company is almost generating net positive EBITDA and will be in the next year or two (think about what happened to $SNAP when they were finally able to turn a profit and the stock price blew up). In their latest S4 Amendment, it shows their Q3 results in 2020 vs. their Q3 results in 2019. They were able to generate almost twice as much Revenue (from $57 Million into $107 Million) and was able to reduce their marketing expense (from $49 million into $39 million) at the same time. Not only that, but they were also able to increase their gross margins from 51% into 72%. As a result of their increased revenue, gross margins and decrease marketing expense, they were able to improve their EBITDA by $49 Million Year over year in 2020. They will mostly likely be EBITDA positive in 2021 when they finish their merger with OAC. Keep in mind that the company is only 3 years old and still have lots and lots of run room. Their growth potential is exponential. 

So far, I have demonstrated that the company has an amazing business model and amazing financials, but what about their social media presence? The HIMS account has 99.9K followers and the HERS account has 100K followers, for a total combined following of 199.9K followers. Their closet competitor is Lemonaid Health, and they only have a total combined following of 8.3K. So clearly HIMS has a lot more social influence than their competitor and once again keep in mind the company is only 3 years old. Having a strong social media influence is part of the reason why they were able to generate more revenue while spending less in marketing in the year of 2020. Most recently, Kylie Jenner (The world‚Äôs youngest self-made billionaire with 208m followers on Instagram) posted an Instagram story of her buying HERS product and tagging Jennifer Lopez (who is a primary business partner and investor of HIMS & HERS). Having strong social media influencers like Kylie Jenner and Jennifer Lopez allows HIMS & HERS to bypass and save money on traditional marketing (like billboards and magazines) and allows the company to directly advertise to their primary target market (a generation of users that prioritize their mental and physical health, and prefer to conduct their business online)

So, they have a great business model, financials, and social media presence, but what about their management team and investors? Andrew Dudum, is the CEO of HIMS & HERS, but before that he was the co-found of ATOMIC, a company that specializes in start-up. The guy literately started a start-up company that focuses on start-ups. This means he knows a thing or two about company valuations and reaching out to venture capitalist to generate funding and increase valuations. As a result, he was able to receive funding from notable investors such as Peter Theil (the guy that invested in FB, PLTR, and many other blow out companies in the early stages).

Okay, so the company has a great business model, financials, social media and leadership, but how much can I expect on my return on investment? The OAC merger gives HIMS a valuation of $1.6 Billion at $10 per share. Currently OAC is trading at around $15, which gives HIMS an implied valuation that is greater than $2 Billion now. However, the CEO, Andrew Dudum, is suggesting the company has a potential to reach $20 Billion, which is a 10X bagger from $15 to $150 per share in the future after the merger. The merger with OAC is expected to be completed by the end of January, afterwards the ticker symbol will start trading as HIMS.

Position: 1K shares

TLDR: OAC Merging with HIMS - The company has a great business model, financials, social media presence, leadership team, and future valuation. Merger expected to be completed by end of month.

2020-01-23 11:54:19,Short $FB. Whatsapp used by MBS to hack Bezos.,"These whatsapp message are hillarious:

Nearly four weeks later, on May 1, Bezos received a WhatsApp message from the crown prince‚Äôs account, which arrived ‚Äúunexpectedly and without explanation, meaning it was not discussed by the parties in advance of being sent,‚Äù according to a November 2019 report by FTI Consulting Inc., a business advisory firm, which was published by Vice.  The message included a 4.22 MB video. Within hours of receiving it, ‚Äúa massive and unauthorized exfiltration of data from Bezos‚Äôs phone began,‚Äù according to the report. 

On Nov. 8, 2018, Bezos received another message from the crown prince‚Äôs WhatsApp account, when Bezos and his wife were exploring a divorce and before his marital problems became public, according to the FTI Consulting report. It showed a picture of a woman who resembled Lauren Sanchez, with whom Bezos was having a then-secret relationship, and read: ‚ÄúArguing with a woman is like reading the Software License Agreement. In the end you have to ignore everything and click I agree,‚Äù according to the report.

The crown prince hasn‚Äôt yet addressed the allegations. But on Feb. 16, 2019, two days after Bezos had received a briefing on the Saudi online campaign against him, his WhatsApp account sent another message to Bezos telling him to be skeptical of what he was hearing. ‚ÄúJeff all what you hear or told to it‚Äôs not true and it‚Äôs matter of time tell you know the truth,‚Äù the message says, according to the FTI Consulting report. ‚ÄúThere is nothing against you or Amazon from me or Saudi Arabia.‚Äù",25,0.75

Tl;Dr: buy Poshmark. It's been corrected a lot since the IPO high of 105 


Alright everyone... While I wouldn‚Äôt define myself as a necessarily intelligent (or competent) investor, but I am very familiar with the platform and the re-commerce industry as a seller and buyer.

I‚Äôve been selling people‚Äôs used shit since high school, in an attempt to finance a previous weed addiction. Fast forward 4 years and I have still been selling people‚Äôs used shit, though now the funds are going toward monthly Model 3 payments I am underwater for. That said, I‚Äôve been selling used clothing and have completed a bit over $300k in gross sales through various ‚Äúre-commerce‚Äù platforms such as eBay, Amazon, FB Marketplace, Mercari, Grailed, and Poshmark. eBay is the most well established platform for used clothing sales and thus wins for market share, but Poshmark wins in nearly every other category- which I have broken down below.




**Selling fees:**

Poshmark has ridiculous selling fees, although it has proven to be beneficial in respect to revenue. The platform makes money by charging a fee for every sale: 20 per cent for items more than $15, and a flat fee of $2.95 for items under $15 that are less than that. Products worth more than $500 must be sent to Poshmark for evaluation, but the average order value is $33. 20% is ridiculous, especially considering that this does not include shipping costs of the seller/buyer. All the other platforms take a standard deviation around 10%, which begs the question why the fuck do they charge so much. People complain but continue to use the platform because of the next point- shipping.

**Shipping:**

For the past few years, the platform and its social media/YouTube influences have been aggressively marketing towards stay at home mothers and teenage girls. These aren‚Äôt your typical streetwear wannabe EnTrePenUeR businessmen, and Poshmark certainly knows that. They supply USPS Priority Mail shipping labels for every. single. fucking. order. Have a 2oz necktie that would ship for $2.62 USPS first class? Fuck that. Poshmark send you a $7.11 Priority Mail label that will arrive to your buyers doorstep faster than Amazons COVID shit prime delayed delivery. While a cost deterrent for lower value items and cheap buyers, this system simplifies the selling process of needing to calculate shipping costs and having to deal with various mail carriers. Packages rarely gets lost and any lost package issues are generally covered by Poshmark or the insure USPS provides through Priority Mail.




$7.11 is cheaper than my Ebay rate for any priority mail, so I also give this one to Poshmark as they seem to have worked something out with USPS. For eBay, if I can shove a pair of Jeans into a Flat Rate Envelope it will cost me $7.59 to ship. Any heavier or larger clothing items cost me, on average, about $9-14. While this last part is speculation, I do believe that Poshmark does get a kickback or receive some commission from every label. The cost has risen about $2 in the past couple years, which is a higher percentile than the USPS shipping rate increase.

**Convenience:**

Buyers love convenience, and poshmark certainly does well in that regard. Poshmark is a large SoCiAl MeDiA MarKetPace, giving them access to a fuckload of your data. When you sign up, you can add the city you live in, university, job etc. You also have the ability to like and share items.

Both of these combined, allow the app to recognize who you are what what type of items you may be interested in buying. My homepage looks the same as my closet at home, shoving new items, markdowns, etc from brands I am much too familiar with.

A lot of purchases tend to be of impulse on the buyer, which is good for sellers since Poshmark doesn‚Äôt allow returns (unless fake/ruined/ not as described). I have a handful of buyers asking me to return items every week because they don‚Äôt like the color, fit, or price; I tell them to fuck off and Poshmark gets to keep the commission. For reference, my return rate on eBay is about 7% for no reason.

I just sold this Ikea Rug today that I was too lazy to return. I paid $10 for it and the buyer most likely saw the nice stock photos on their homepage and failed to crosscheck the price on IKEA. Convenience of the homepage.




**SEO:**

I study rhetoric so I have no fucking clue how to rank or asses the SEO of a company, but look for any used clothing brand and Poshmark will generally be the first to show up on google. If that doesn‚Äôt signify good SEO, idk remember I study rhetoric.




**Market share:**

In terms of Fashion and clothing APPS, I think Poshmark does fairly well. An in depth DD would reference technology, social media, and e-commerce platforms as well- but I‚Äôll just include a graph I found.

In terms of their presence online, I think Poshmark does the best job engaging with their users. They are constantly reposting buyers and sellers images on instagram- making it somewhat of an incentive to use the platform and engage with others in the community. I‚Äôve been posted a few times on their instagram page and story. As a seller, I‚Äôve also been invited out to drinks with some of the staff in SF. Was all food and drinks at the bar covered by Poshmark? Idk ask my Jonny Walker Blue.


**TLDR:** I think Poshmark is a great platform, doing very different things than traditional selling platforms. Much higher fees and seamless shipping integration makes the platform a winner. They are valued as a selling platform, but they are much more than simply just that. Can you buy Lululemon pants at $GME? No, but you can on Poshmark. I also have not proofread this post at all.

Arrival$CIIC that went from $12 to $30 $CIIC, BB is under the hood.

They've also partnered with Plus, and a bunch of other automotive companies ala Jaguar/Ford.

$TSLA Elon Musk ring a bell? $BB is under the hood of SpaceX.

They've integrated athoc in Microsoft teams. I'm in devOps, teams is the future. 

They've partnered with $ZM to create an enterprise version of the app, caveat being they named it poorly so people think it's what's made for blackberry phones.


Some other partners
Bell Canada, Service$NOW, Space force, Canadian Gov, $AMZN, Canoo, Qcomm, Land rover

More good news:

Patents, they're one of the largest patent holding companies in the world. Rumour has it that they're selling most of it.

Heard of $FB and messenger?

They just recently lost a patent battle in November to blackberry that disallows them from switching from games to messaging apps.

The revenue story:

They ""only"" make 800-1b annually, about what Palantir makes IIRC.

This¬†quarter¬†should¬†be¬†interesting¬†because¬†of¬†the¬†hiring¬†of¬†Tom¬†from¬†Citrix.

Why they haven't mooned yet:

2019-11-05 05:20:56,Short FB?,"So Facebook [recently announced](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/11/introducing-our-new-company-brand/) that they are rebranding.

Imagine a company of that scale using such a bad picture for this announcement. Like the colour of the letters is almost the same as the guy's shirt and it makes the logo not stand out at all. But let's forget this minor detail in comparison, here's what their plan is:

""People should know which companies make the products they use. Our main services include the Facebook app, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus, Workplace, Portal and Calibra.""

""Over the coming weeks, we will start using the new brand within our products and marketing materials, including a new company website.""

How delusional are they actually? Facebook is *lucky* that most of the users of Instagram and WhatsApp don't even have a clue that these services are run by Facebook. Facebook is not cool anymore, it hasn't been in 10 years. Everyone knows that the ""boo"" in Facebook stands for ""boomer"". Some users of these services are also concerned about their data and it really won't help to remind them everytime they're using these services that all their data goes directly to Suckerberg.

It's actually in Facebook's interest that their customers are clueless and they're doing the exact opposite to keep it that way. This is a stupid move by Facebook and it shows that they're quite delusional about the public's perception of Facebook. Pretty bad move by FB imo.",54,0.88

There is no other reason why they must create a currency (now called DIEM backed by USD), they could have just use USD (just like Alipay/Wechat in China). The fact that they keep trying to create some form of digital money on their own means they wanted a global currency controlled by Lizardboy.

2020-12-10 05:23:54,"Selling DoorDash after IPO? | AirBNB IPO NEXT | LULU, ADBE, COST, PLAY STOCK EARNINGS | STOCK MARKET NEWS [12-10]","**DoorDash just went public in a crazy overvalued IPO, AirBNB will follow today. Today we get earnings from Lululemon, Adobe, Dave & Busters, Costco & more. Let‚Äôs talk about this and everything about the stock market**

Hey everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/bzmy8C4) drop almost 2% and suffering its biggest loss since October after the 4-day win streak, the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Kw3DKxD) also dropped .80% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/9GvPGh5) did much better, down just .35% for the day. We saw a huge spike in the volatility [index](https://ibb.co/RcShWPM) of over 7% closing at the highest level since the 23rd of November.

We saw more companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/YkqyTgh) as finally some stocks have started to move below the moving averages on about average volume for the day.

We saw most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/Wfn4Trj) in the red yesterday as Tech and Communications suffered the most dropping more than 1% for the day, with small gains being made in just the Industrials, Energy and Materials sectors as Growth companies suffered the most [yesterday](https://ibb.co/5hQKP88), especially the Large-Caps as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/V9bfV71), with all the big FAANG names and other big tech companies being deep in the red as Apple, Amazon, and Netflix dropped more than 2% for the day, while FB, Google and Microsoft also lost over 1%, but the big loser yesterday was Tesla losing 7% for the day.

Today we will get some critical economic [data](https://ibb.co/qnkdTJz), and if this disappoints, we might see another big drop in the stock market, as the jobless claims will start us off in the early morning.

Alongside this economic data, today the [FDA](https://ibb.co/0906d6L) may approve the emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine, that could lead to a vaccine rollout starting next week. This might help the markets have a more positive reaction if the FDA grants the authorization.

One good thing in my opinion is that the most recent [survey](https://ibb.co/5WPhj8B) from the AAII showed a slight decrease in Bullish and Neutral investors while the Bearish camp gained more than 4% in the last week.

Investors had gotten very bullish in the last weeks and this usually is a contrarian indicator, so seeing this small drop is a good thing to see, as I want more and more people to start feeling bearish so I can find and buy stocks at more attractive prices than the current ones. So, the more bearish people get, the more I like to get on and buy stocks. But still‚Ä¶ there is to much of a concentration in the bull‚Äôs camp so we might have to wait a little, for more fear to appear in the stock market.

Positive indicators also popped up yesterday as Wholesale [invetories](https://ibb.co/WxPPLpS) rose more than expected in October, as this led the Atlanta FED to maintain they‚Äôre Q4 GDP [estimates](https://ibb.co/SBZPtZP), while [Goldman](https://ibb.co/sQ42gCg) also thinks the economy will recover faster than expected starting with Q4 and going on next year.

While on the jobs front, October job opening came in [better](https://ibb.co/4VdrTbQ) than expected at over 6,6M, as the job opening rate stood at 6,7% while the quits rate at just 2,2%.

So, DoorDash went live [yesterday](https://ibb.co/LJtbPtH) at 182$ which is insane in my opinion, the current price gives the company a [valuation](https://ibb.co/kcBcpYW) of over $70B, more than 4 times what the company raised at the last private fundraising six months ago. This valuation is higher than Chipotle, Yum Brands, Domino‚Äôs and many others from the food industry.

And by the way, don‚Äôt forget the stock is [trading](https://ibb.co/CP0Qgbr) at over 30 times sales of this year, which were hugely boosted by the current situation, and that food delivery is really hard for any company, especially one that expects to grow to have a share of more than 50% of the entire world in the sector so that it can justify the current valuation.

One of the biggest gainers from this is SoftBank as they have a big stake in the company. The shares of SoftBank [skyrocketed](https://ibb.co/GnTSqJf) yesterday to new highs in almost two decades. Like almost every time, the biggest gainers in this IPOs are the banks and not us the retail investors.

With the other big [IPO](https://ibb.co/Ld0pMdz) yesterday being C3.ai which also opened way above the IPO price, as investors can‚Äôt get enough of this stock‚Äôs, I don‚Äôt think this is a healthy hype for this type of IPOs, investors expect every new company to just skyrocket but, not all of them will, and paying such a high premium is not worth it most time, better wait for a pullback before getting some action on these stocks.

Today we will see [AirBNB](https://ibb.co/Hxd70Tb) go public, as the valuation for this company also gets higher and higher, as they have started selling shares for 68$ even higher than the latest targeted price between 56-60$. And if DoorDash is any [indication](https://ibb.co/8cb3yTs), I don‚Äôt think we will be able to get our hands on this stock below 100$. Way above my 70-80$ max price that I am willing to pay, so I am going to wait this out also until they have a pullback, maybe once the first earnings come out, that will be the case. But if somehow the IPO is under 80$ and especially under 70$ I would be willing to get some action.

Some other [news](https://ibb.co/H4Pxqmq) from the stock market which pushed companies like Facebook lower came in when almost every US state filed a lawsuit against the company. In the long run, if this happens just like with the Google lawsuit, the sum of the parts of the company is bigger than the company itself, so I don‚Äôt really have any worries long-term about Facebook or Google, as they are the 2 of the biggest advertising platforms in the world.

While [REAL ESTATE](https://ibb.co/0X85Cb4) is starting to make a small comeback in New York, as leases jumped 30% year over year in November to around 4000 new ones, but it will still take a very long time before things go back to where they stood before this year.

Also, we will have a lot of earnings results today as [Oracle](https://ibb.co/jb5CPPV), Lululemon, Adobe, Dave & Busters, Costco, Broadcom and others report.

I expect [Lululemon](https://ibb.co/J2MBWD2) to beat the estimates and the stock to regain momentum after it has struggled since the beginning of September. And just like analysts from Raymond James [said](https://ibb.co/gFL3T0s), the only underlying story problem for investors it‚Äôs the valuation, but this will soon go away, as people will buy this brand even more once the reopening begins.

Likewise, [Dave & Buster's](https://ibb.co/L0rY2YS) may have smaller loses than expected last quarter as restaurants weren‚Äôt hit so badly like before or like this quarter.

While [BROADCOM](https://ibb.co/b5kYKLB) stands to benefit a lot from the recent move in semiconductor industry especially for data centers that stands to benefit them a lot.

[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/D19qrSc) will also report earnings after the close, and is expected to show over 14% growth in eps and revenues since last year, as they are one of the best retailers to own as a shareholder, even if they always trade at a premium.

Adobe just released earnings while writing this post and here are the excelent results that the company [posted](https://ibb.co/kyzBLjv). Now let's see how the stock reacts, will it go down or up?

So, guys, don‚Äôt forget not to panic sell when you see a big red day in the markets, just look at this Wells Fargo [chart](https://ibb.co/yQwKpt0).

Investors who added 30% more exposure to equities, and took the money from investment-grade fixed income largely outperform the rest of the investors, while the average investor who does a quarterly rebalancing also did very good and is still up over 10% for the year, while investors who reduced the equity exposure by 50% and put that money into fixed income or kept it in cash are up just 2%. With by far the worst results seen in investors who removed all of the exposure to equities, they are down 6% for the year.

Just be patient, trust the companies that you like and keep investing every time you can. In the long-run markets will always go UP & UP.

2021-01-13 07:03:53,Post #3 Wednesday: I have a discount trading bot which gives out daily (well hourly discounts for the stock market). Here‚Äôs what the bot stated under discounted companies...,"Wednesday, 13 January 2021

*Live Updates*

&#x200B;

**First Post:**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuwg1e/i\_have\_a\_discount\_trading\_bot\_which\_gives\_out/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuwg1e/i_have_a_discount_trading_bot_which_gives_out/)

&#x200B;

**Background:**

* My discount bot to help /r/wallstreetbets. It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.
* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.
* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.
* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.
* There are a lot of SPY500/""boomer"" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.
* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.
* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement
* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only
* This is a one man bot.

&#x200B;

**Bot Overview**:

It's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits. Note: that this has not been efficiently back tested. 

&#x200B;

**Key:**

* Pharma companies are very risky.
* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.
* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.
* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).
* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.
* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.
* Take the ""Calls"" as very discounted, and ""Potentially A Call"" as somewhat discounted.
* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.
* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.
* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.

2021-02-05 09:26:45,Wow.. RH ad just.. WTFBBQ,"Mind you i never touched RH with a 1000ft pole. But this showed up on my FB feed today which cracked me up. 

https://preview.redd.it/0f8zkq571pf61.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=06b1961b6e36cf526fd176bc66a446d276890728",19,0.83
2021-01-17 13:37:22,$TWTR appears to be a good potential buy üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ,"This is not financial advice. Trades should not be made on the information presented below. You should do your own DD. Everything below is a matter of opinion and is subject to change, and should be verified. This is also my first DD, so I apologize in advance for mistakes that may be present below. If you do see anything, please call it out in the comments.

Twitter ($TWTR) appears to be on sale, with good signs of upside. Twitter's share price has fallen substantially in light of allegations of censorship and removing Trump from their platform. Other firms in big tech have also experienced similar scrutiny by taking similar steps in light of recent events (i.e. FB and the Zucc). This has left shares on sale, with some appearingly positive buy signals on $TWTR.

Bull Case: Recent price trends and technicals may give an indication for price projections in the near future. While WSB might not like TA, I think it can be useful for making price projections, especially when used in conjunction with evidence from times it has worked previously.

&#x200B;

[red = low where we are; blue = two other interesting lows](https://preview.redd.it/nojbl40jbyb61.png?width=1104&format=png&auto=webp&s=e35f91ec51393a44e36e1a02981f35a80efd8ff0)

The stock has a strong up trend-line (support, blue) that is touched 3-4 times over the duration of the pandemic rally (March-Present). The two blue arrows signify two important times this support has been touched previously and reversal ensues. At these two points, it also touches or partially penetrates the ichimoku cloud, which can act as an additional support level. Both are also marked by a distinct local minimum in RSI (of roughly 40) in the purple pane. After both of these lows, a substantial retracement occurs, often reaching the value of the previous high rapidly.

Note: values below are estimated

The pattern in these two lows suggests that once the price hits the support, it rapidly retraces to the previous high and then price increases in excess of the previous high. In this first, this is represented by a high of roughly 35 in June, falling to a low of 28 in July where it touches the trendline, and then rockets back to 35 within 2-3 weeks and then exceeding that value in the next weeks (gain of approximately 20% with a buy at 28 and sell target at 35). Similarly, in the second area this is represented by a high of roughly 52 at the end of October, falling to the indicated low of 40 at the start of November (indicated by the second blue arrow), which then rises to 52 in roughly 6 weeks (mid December), and then continues to increase beyond that. This represents a gain in excess of 25% from the low around 40 with a sell target at 52.

At present (red arrow), the stock is poised with the lowest RSI that's been seen in the pandemic rally, falling below 30. This suggests that the stock is oversold, and it is likely to experience a reversal in the near future. Moreover, the price is sitting just at the ichimoku cloud and near the trendline, two supports that were observed in the previous two examples. There is also additional resistance caused by a double bottom, as a result of another candle that shares a low with the current low price. This evidence suggests that TWTR will likely see a big move going upwards in the near future. Buying in now (45.18) and setting a price target around the previous high (55.87) could be return a profit of roughly 23% based on previous patterns. The time horizon for this gain is relatively short, with expectations of around 2-6 weeks based on the two previous trend-line touches (blue). With the oversold RSI condition, it may even be able to reach or exceed the target in a much faster time than previously.

Disclosure of Concerns: Currently the price has fallen below the up trendline (albeit not by much). If the price does fall further, this could indicate the trendline has been violated and the share price will collapse. I think due to the oversold RSI, this is unlikely and that the price is more likely to reverse back into the trading range. Moreover, while the ichimoku cloud does tend to act as a resistance, the price being inside the cloud often suggests greater risk of the stock moving sideways (note how after the second blue arrow, price increases much more slowly when it is trapped inside the cloud). Confirmation of a movement upwards or downwards should be sought before making any trades on twitter stock in light of these concerns. The climate around Twitter isn't positive at present, and this could prolong the amount of time before the the move completes, or even drive down the share price if the situation does not improve. Even after the Trump presidency has ended, twitter is likely to face additional controversy over decisions it may make with the incoming administration. One example is the suggestion that Twitter might reset follower counts to 0 for official White House accounts once the new administration enters. This could put twitter under greater scrutiny once the new administration takes office, with accusations of unfairness already in the air.

TLDR; $TWTR appears to have positive upside. Projections may suggest a gain of over 20% over a span of about 2-6 weeks based on previous price patters. However, there are multiple concerns present in the current climate surrounding the stock and some concerns regarding the current technical position.

Positions in $TWTR: None. I made this DD for fun. If you are interested in purchasing $TWTR shares or calls, I highly encourage doing your own DD before you buy in. This is not financial advice. All of the material presented is just opinion that needs to be verified and is subject to change.",0,0.5

#[Today's Top Headlines for Friday, January 8th, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-january-8-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Wall Street set to continue its record run

> U.S. stock futures rose Friday, one day after the Nasdaq closed at a record high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 also closed Thursday at records. Both benchmarks were tracking for weekly gains despite Monday‚Äôs sharp drops, the first negative starts to a new year since 2016. The Nasdaq was also solidly higher for the week as Wall Street powered higher over the past two days despite Wednesday‚Äôs deadly siege at the U.S. Capitol and its fallout.

> Bitcoin, which topped $40,000 on Thursday for the first time ever, passed $41,000 on Friday. The world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency has been up more than 30% in the first days of 2021 and 400% over the past 12 months. The value of the entire crypto market, which is made up of bitcoin and other digital coins, topped $1 trillion Thursday for the first time.

> Tesla shares marched higher in Friday‚Äôs premarket after rising 10 sessions in a row, surpassing Facebook in market value, and making CEO Elon Musk the world‚Äôs richest person. Thursday‚Äôs increase in Tesla‚Äôs share price pushed Musk past Amazon‚Äôs Jeff Bezos, who had been the richest person since 2017.

*****

> # 2. December jobs report could be weaker than forecast

> The pace of job growth likely slowed dramatically and could even be negative in December, as the coronavirus spread rapidly across the U.S. Economists expect to see a gain of 50,000 jobs, down from 245,000 nonfarm payrolls additions in November. The Labor Department‚Äôs monthly employment report is out at 8:30 a.m. ET, and the stock market could react more to a positive surprise than a negative one. The 10-year Treasury yield remained above 1% early Friday ahead of that report.

*****

> # 3. Trump finally concedes Biden will become president

> President Donald Trump late Thursday admitted ‚Äî for the first time in his own words, despite vowing never to concede ‚Äî that a ‚Äúnew administration will be inaugurated‚Äù on Jan. 20. In a nearly three-minute video, posted after his Twitter lockout ended, Trump did not mention President-elect Joe Biden by name. It came a day after the outgoing president sparked the riot that saw a mob breach the U.S. Capitol in protest of the election.

*****

> # 4. Pelosi, Schumer call for Trump removal from office

> Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are calling for Trump‚Äôs removal, accusing him of inciting ‚Äúinsurrection.‚Äù Schumer said that if Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet do not move to invoke the 25th Amendment, Congress should reconvene to impeach Trump.

> Pelosi said Congress ‚Äúmay be prepared‚Äù to impeach Trump if executive branch officials do not act.

> Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were among the Cabinet secretaries who discussed the possibility of invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump, three sources told CNBC. They determined the process of elevating Pence to the presidency could take more than a week, diluting its effects.

*****

> # 5. Single-day Covid deaths top 4,000 for first time

> The U.S. had its first day of over 4,000 deaths from Covid-19. In the single worst day of the pandemic Thursday, 4,085 people died from the virus. The latest coronavirus surge iaw record seven-day averages of new daily infections and deaths running at 228,497 and 2,764, respectively. As of Thursday, the number of people hospitalized with Covid fell slightly from Wednesday‚Äôs record high levels.

> A coronavirus vaccine developed by U.S.-based Pfizer and Germany‚Äôs BioNTech appears to be effective against a key mutation in the more infectious variants of the coronavirus discovered in the U.K. and South Africa. The research by Pfizer has not been peer reviewed. The World Health Organization said last month that health authorities were ‚Äúurgently investigating‚Äù whether the virus mutation affects vaccine performance.

#**DISCUSS!**

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/wallstreetbets?

*****

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Friday, January 8th, 2021! :)**",22,0.86
2020-12-23 09:39:10,MGNI overview and brief DD üöÄüöÄüöÄ,"**TLDR:** 1/15 $40C if you're feeling risky. 3/19 $35 calls if not.

**What is Magnite and how does it make money?**

Magnite is a sell-side advertising platform (SSP) that aggregates advertising units (aside from GOOG, AMZN, and FB). This is an automated platform that takes these units from publishers across different media channels (e.g., mobile, tablets, Connected TVs, etc.) and then sells them to the buy-side (DSPs like TTD). Magnite makes money through a ""take-rate"" - essentially taking a cut from the publishers sales. That cut is somewhere in the realm of 8-14%

**Why Magnite over company xyz in this space?**

Magnite has big goals. The companies Telaria (leader in CTV) and Rubicon (leader elsewhere) merged in April to be the #1 player in this space. Think back to that management class you took sophomore year of college where they talked about the BCG growth-share matrix. Magnite is a star (or üöÄüöÄüöÄ), meaning it has a **high growth rate** (we'll get to that below) and **high share**

**Why will they keep going up?**

* The space Magnite plays in is HOT (30%+ CAGR). Linear TV (that $200/mo bill your grandma pays DirecTV) is dying, and streaming is taking over 
* Taking this further - Magnite stands to make money off of streaming content that has advertising (AVODs/FAST). The SVOD market (Netflix and co.) has matured, but ad-based content is just now taking off. Think players like PlutoTV, Xumo, Tubi (all acquired by huge players like CBS, Comcast, and Fox this year). It's the place to be, and Magnite is the winner because it can profit off of all of them
* So far, just a Disney+ relationship has been announced. **Expect more of those announcements** in the coming months.
* In terms of valuation, MGNI is only at a $3B market cap. TTD sits at $30B. 
   * MGNI's EV/rev is \~13, TTD's is 59

**Responses to common comments**

* ""They're up 90% in a month, thanks for the late DD""
   * *Better late than never, this was on CNBC for the first time yesterday and the real pump is just beginning*
* ""Needham has a $30 PT, which they've already blown by""
   * *Needham's PT is based on a DCF analysis. $30 is the bottom. Speculation will make this  üöÄ*
* ""You're an idiot""
   * *Ya*

**Positions**

* Safe play: Q4 earnings are expected mid-late February. Any March calls are a safe bet as even a dip will get eaten up and this will run up to a monster Q4 earnings report, given record CTV sales and everyone sitting at home watching the Mandalorian in Q4
   * 3/19 $35C
* WSB play: $40C options just opened up, buckle your seat belts
   * 1/15 $40C",39,0.94

- In 2016 after Q1 earnings, FB went up from 94.45 to 109.11...15.5% 

- ""George Soros says FB is conspiring to get Trump relected - Article by Bloomberg"". Boogeyman Soros and most polarized social media user Trump with FB in the same title? Add in Bloomberg? FB is going to the moon. https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/et00sa/george_soros_says_facebook_is_conspiring_to/

- We're expecting EPS to go up regardless, but current estimates are too low. 
- I'd expect share prices to go to 240 after earnings. If it goes to 240 we're looking at a 9.1% price increase over the course of a week (with a best case of 255 - 16% over a week). Buy your calls for 225 or 230 now, this can't go down.

2021-02-02 06:26:28,WIN THE FIGHT (unpopular opinion),"Hi all. First of all excuse me if my english is not the best.
2nd thing: make clear I m holding hell yes!! üôåüíé
3rd thing: dont have any knowledge about markets, I mean 0, nothing.

This is a war. I dont feel like we will win without fighting or working on it. The dark side indeed are manipulating all they can, working to win hard. I see like most of us just sit front pc, say hold and waits for the win.

Dont think in the same way. We need to work for the win too.

Imagine a balloon (remember I dont have any knowledge about all this), to win we need/want to explode it. The dark side is taking out just some air everyday, they want the pressure to disappear for win.

There are many ways for put more pressure in the balloon, mainly is buying more, easy. But most of us cant put more money in this.
Then, we can (my 3rd post about this) get all the fucking world involved in this. It s a fight david vs goliath, everyone love this fights. We ll get many people helping, they just still dont know about this fight.

Bomb twitter, fb, instagram, etc....try to get known people in this. Create a movement or how is called, in the social media. Get everyone knowing about this, what is, and why we do. Share your funny billboards all arround, your generous donations you are doing, this is called publicity and is a tool to win.

Other pressure is not directly on we are doing, instead of pressure over what the dark side is doing. Send infinite complains about this to the SEC, media news, wherever is needed. (I tried to fill a complain document online to the SEC, didnt know even what to write, I m useless)
Put so many eyes on their movements to make them stop manipulating, or starting to proceed (SEC).

To end, resuming, I see most of us being ""lazy and bored"", shouting hold!!!!! And dont have clear at all we will win only with this. Move your ass and start working for the victory.

With my best intention.

2021-01-14 09:51:42,TD Ameritrade unlimited buying glitch: 2023 Fubo 45 covered calls with no money in you‚Äôre account,"I DON‚ÄôT RECOMMEND DOING THIS.....

So I‚Äôm scrolling through fb at 5am bored, waiting for the market to open. The Robinhood group is talking about fubo tv. I‚Äôm half awake and look at the chart and notice it hit ATH at $60 Tuesday. I‚Äôm expecting a mini rally before it goes to shit. Based on the analyze tool, the trade was a guaranteed winner as long as the stock didn‚Äôt close below $20 a share at exp (td has never forced me out a trade), it was at $40, and ipoed around $15ish but traded around $25ish.

One of my accounts with TD had Apple call spreads worth $50 for earnings and $0.70 buying power yet the system allowed the trade to go in premarket yesterday. I‚Äôm confused as hell why this is going in but assume it will autocorrect at 8-9am. I forget about it.

9:30am, I sell my nflx 500/505c exp fri for $150, too early ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è it shoots up to $400 15 minutes later
I sell my amzn 3080/3085c for $320 too early

I notice fubo executes and shit is it volatile. I have no idea what to do. The mid point was $19.50 premarket, I put in $17ish thinking no way it executes. It drops to $14.50, comes back positive for a few seconds before staying around 14-15 mark. TD for the first time ever forces me out the position. I have to eat a $335 loss. Thank god I didn‚Äôt add leverage. TD rep has no idea why the system allowed the order to go through. 

Fast forward now, the system is still accepting covered call orders for Fubo with no cash required upfront! It‚Äôs letting me buy multiple contracts despite my account not being able to afford it. It‚Äôs allowing me to place an order to short 100 calls and buy the stock which would cost about $300k. 

This only seems to work for fubo stock. I tried Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Airbnb, and even cheaper prices and it didn‚Äôt work.

2020-12-23 05:37:58,Will Trump Veto the Stimulus? | Direct IPOs | MRNA & BA | Stock Market News for Today [12-23],"**Can and will Trump actually Veto the stimulus bill? The NYSE approved the plan for direct IPOs. Should you sell Moderna & buy Boeing? Let‚Äôs talk about this and everything about the stock market.**

 **\~Very Long Post\~** 

Hello everyone and Good Morning!  So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the tech heavy [Nasdaq](https://ibb.co/ryVyyKt) up more than 0.5% and closing at a new all-time high, while the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/X31XLDq) finished down 0.21% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/qB2m8Jm) lagged behind, finishing the day with a 200 points loss, its biggest loss in December. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/Qkw3MBK) trending down after that huge spike in volatility on Monday as more than 50% of companies were declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/QXzWV6h) as even more companies continue to move below the 50-day moving average on about average volume. We saw only 2 [sectors](https://ibb.co/cT4Z90m) finishing in the green yesterday (Technology & Real Estate) while the biggest losers were in the Energy, Financial and Communications sectors as small caps continue their outperformance in the past weeks especially growth companies, while large-cap value plays lagged the market on [Tuesday](https://ibb.co/9VGmwtC).

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/34wtTb6) from yesterday, and you can that [Apple](https://ibb.co/dmNdcRy) pushed even higher, gaining almost 3% again after the reports earlier in the week of the company moving towards an EV or Self-Driving Technology play while [Tesla](https://ibb.co/r6d3Zvp) is approaching correction territory very fast as we also saw a lot more companies losing ground with big losers like Alibaba, Chevron, FB and many more.

We also got some economic data numbers yesterday as the consumer [confidence](https://ibb.co/PTT4BbQ) dropped to under 90, way below the 97 levels expected and 92.9 in the previous month. This was a result of a decline in the present situation confidence of the consumers due to the more uncertainty in the cold months. With home [sales](https://ibb.co/9TNmp0B) also falling more than expected but are still more than 25% up from a year ago with price also increasing by more than 14%.

But we did see an [improved](https://ibb.co/VxtKTwR) Q3 GDP revision up 0.3%, with most of the growth coming from [private](https://ibb.co/dcV1HkX) good & services, with 21 of the 22 industry [groups](https://ibb.co/LJDSsLW) contributing as Durable Good and Health Care helped the most, while utilities did almost nothing and mining was a negative for the US Economy.

[Today](https://ibb.co/3cGf7HN) we have tons of economic data coming in, starting with initial and continuing jobless claims, consumer spending, core inflation, consumer sentiment index and many more, this might give the stock market some direction depending on how the data comes in.

So, we saw a stunning turn of events late yesterday as Trump signed a [stopgap](https://ibb.co/ctsF0pn) bill again to fund the US agencies for another week, but threatened to not sign the [stimulus](https://ibb.co/9Wf6n9P) bill and [demanded](https://ibb.co/sFvMkNv)  bigger stimulus checks up to $2000 for individual Americans. I think this is really more of a bluff from him, as I don‚Äôt think he can do anything at this point. Even if he doesn‚Äôt sign this deal, it is very likely that Congress will act quickly as the necessary veto-proof votes have been reached in both the Senate and the House, as I think, it‚Äôs rather unlikely, they can negotiate more than this, as Republicans will demand something in return. Senate Leader McConell has [already](https://ibb.co/Fsn4BQy) set up a veto override effort for next Tuesday in case Trump does veto the bill, so we will have to wait and see what Trump does today, as my belief is that he did whole thing just so people wouldn‚Äôt talk about the pardons he gave out yesterday.

In some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/KDDZ01D), we also saw Vaccine companies like Moderna and BioNTech continue to drop after they were hugely bought as a reaction to the vaccine news in the last months, as the new strain is causing some doubt in them, but I don‚Äôt think this is going to be a problem for them, but I do still think they are way to expensive at the moment, as I said in a previous post, I think Moderna doesn‚Äôt deserve more than a $100 price at the moment. And I don‚Äôt even believe that Pfizer which is nearing another [deal](https://ibb.co/ggtmmXc) to provide even more doses to the US is poised for big growth ahead, the one that I am keeping an eye on is JNJ, as their vaccine only needs 1 dose and is due to have some data for release early in 2021.

Meanwhile Boeing received some good [news](https://ibb.co/c8d8xFj) as Alaska Airlines announced a better deal with the company to acquire 68 planes with options for another 52 in the future. This is very good news for the company as they have had a big number of orders canceled in 2020. Alaska looked to take advantage of the reduced order backlog and probably a good discount on the deal. So yeah, full disclosure I own Boeing and I think they will do better in the next years as they are still trading well below all time-highs.

We also got news from Store Capital as they announced [rent](https://ibb.co/YLpLZVg) collections of 90% in December, on par with the last months, this is a good read on the economy, as most business manage to survive these last few months of lockdowns before things will get better and return to a more normal life & business cycle.

And one last good piece of [news](https://ibb.co/NCB5bxJ) for us retail investors is that the NYSE approved the direct listing plan for IPOs, this will level the playing field for us everyday investors and will also provide companies with another path of going public.

Let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/CPD8t3h) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the SP500 & Nasdaq Composite leading the way.

2020-11-29 11:05:31,Has anyone tracked how a Becky ETF would perform?,"What‚Äôs up degenerates! I have a genius or retarded proposition for you all.

The *Becky* is your Starbucks drinking, athleisure wearing, Etsy shopping, iPhone using girl next door‚Äîa powerful and important consumer group within the market. We‚Äôve all seen how well Becky stocks can perform, especially in recent months‚ÄîPTON, ETSY, PINS, SBUX‚ÄîI thought about setting up a paper account with a stock portfolio split between a series of becky-type stocks. Yes, a paper account. *I don‚Äôt have the balls nor the capital to go all in on this.*

Would this be worthwhile, even just for kicks? I don‚Äôt know what kind of insight it would provide, if any. But if I go through with this, I‚Äôd post updates once a week where the community can discuss the performance of the portfolio and what changes (if any) to make for the upcoming week.

It‚Äôd be important to have the portfolio be at least mildly diverse with holdings in multiple companies, in order to mimic an ETF.


Currently the BECKY companies I can think of, organized by sector:


**Tech:**

APPL - Apple, Inc.

PINS - Pinterest, Inc.

UBER - Uber Technologies, Inc.


**Communication Services:**

TWTR - Twitter, Inc.

FB - Facebook, Inc.

NFLX - Netflix, Inc.


**Consumer Defensive:**

TGT - Target Corporation

COTY - Coty, Inc.


**Consumer Discretionary:**

SBUX - Starbucks Corporation

LULU - Lululemon Athletica, Inc.

ETSY - Etsy, Inc.

FTCH - Farfetch Limited

PTON - Peloton Interactive, Inc.

LVMH - Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (Owners of Sephora, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Fenty, and others)

ATZ - Aritzia, Inc.


**Comsumer Cyclical**

NKE - Nike, Inc.

ULTA - Ulta Beauty, Inc.

LB - L Brands, Inc. (Owners of Victoria‚Äôs Secret, Pink, Bath and Body Works)

TJX - The TJX Companies, Inc.

Any companies you disagree with adding? Any companies I overlooked? How many different stocks would be good?

Also to note, with companies like APPL and TWTR there may not be a large amount of short term growth compared to younger companies.

Any suggestions you guys have are welcome. I‚Äôm looking for ideas on where to host the paper account, how much money to start with, and what percentages to allocate to which companies at the start.

Yolo'd call last month up 700% now yolo-ing puts for DEC18.","Last month i bought calls for JMIA and made 700% on the calls. The stock has a predictable pattern of ups and downs so i bet up. was right. but now it's time for the down turn. However we are dealing with some unique forces because a few idiots like Citron and other MSNBC homos think it's going to be the next AMZN. Besides all of u/yoinkedmustache points here ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jo4n9t/puts\_on\_nigerian\_scam/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jo4n9t/puts_on_nigerian_scam/) ) there are additional reasons why JMIA is a bad company, which i think is why they've had to release a beautifully-designed powerpoint deck full of irrelevant bullshit numbers (with a focus on percentages, not the magnitude of their paltry numbers) to keep the confusion and bs charade going.

\-GMV is down by 15%. AMZN never once had a year where GMV was down from the year prior.

\-They have EUR 147M in cash, but their 9 month operating loss is EUR 109M. They spend EUR 72M in G&A costs (tech, execs, etc.) in 9 months. They need to raise cash. 

\-They've slowed down on advertising (sounds like they're reaching their limit around EUR 150M in annual revenue)

\-All of their bullshit about user growth is because they keep adding verticals like food delivery, JumiaPay, gaming, etc. which are not likely to be profitable either.

\-Their 'business mix rebalancing' is a masterclass in stupidity. To turn the focus to fashion, beauty, home & living, FMCG away from difficult to find products like electronics is not going to work. 

   \>The move to fashion, beauty, home & living, and FMGC seems smart for two reasons. 

\+Firstly, as a consumer, you don't really need to worry about the quality of fashion products or FMGC, either it's built into the brand (Proctor & Gamble) or its a t-shirt/shoes and you don't really need to be concerned with the 'quality' of a t-shirt or shoes (they don't cost $1000 nor are they going to explode upon opening). Trust is one of the two biggest issues facing JMIA, the other being the unnecessity of shopping online Africa, where small shops line neighborhoods.

\++Study done which shows Africans have lower ""interpersonal trust"" than pretty much anywhere else in the world ([https://ourworldindata.org/trust](https://ourworldindata.org/trust)), which is not good for e-commerce.

\+ Secondly, the sellers of these products are typically smaller 'independent' businesses who JMIA can extract higher commissions from. 30% of total items sold on JMIA in 2019 were fashion or beauty products which are designed and manufactured by small local companies. The sellers also want an outlet to sell their products.

\-With the pivot toward fashion/beauty product they've brilliantly increased their competition with Facebook's suite of products (FB, Instagram, WhatsApp), which are wildly popular in Africa.

\-They're also competing with the millions of tiny little shops on the sides of the road, which are scattered across neighborhoods and main roads, which don't require you to wait, pay a delivery fee, or   worry about delivery, waste your time opening the app, etc.

I'm sure there are 30 other reasons to short the shit out of the stock, but what is more a sign of death than slowing down growth when your an e-commerce platform in a market of 1.5B people (and you only have like 1-2% of the market as 'active users' which is a metric for anyone who bought something one-time in 12 months...to 'focus on profitability'.",43,0.96
2021-01-27 12:25:03,How about some love for Shake Shack (SHAK)? Potential opportunity from undervaluation based on sales-to-share growth.,"On 9/24/18, I [predicted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9ilhm0/riskreward_analysis/) that FB would drop from 163 to 130 within a few months. I have been thanked by people who followed me and incidentally, that post was also how I got my flair.

The other day, one of my students brought to my attention a potential opportunity in SHAK. I‚Äôve thought a lot about it and I‚Äôm increasingly believing in his convictions. Here are some facts:

1. From 2015 to now, the annual geometric return of SHAK was only about 10%/year. Over that same period, their sales/share has been growing at over 20%/year. The most recent quarter‚Äôs report implies a sales/share of 26% in the last year. I believe the market is slow to realize a lot of idiosyncratic factors when we have large macro events like the pandemic going on. 

2. Bright short-term outlook. Vaccine rates are going up. California lifted its stay-at-home order and allowed for outdoor dining. Hospitalization and Covid rates are going down. 

3. Have you ever had their fucking burgers? If you don‚Äôt like their burgers, you aren‚Äôt human. There was a line going around the store for pickup only when I went and it was similar to the iPhone craze when they were first released.

2020-11-27 07:18:55,BB - A Cybersecurity Company (Not Phones!),"Remember BlackBerry, the phone with the cool keyboard that went out of fashion? Well they haven't made phones in years.

BB is a **cybersecurity & software company** with the wrong name!

Think embedded systems, data privacy, safety, endpoint security management, encryption, IoT, AI, zero trust architecture and so on. And think EV and AV (autonomous vehicles), too, where they have had a significant presence and continue to grow.

Let me paint the picture for you with some recent headlines:

* [BlackBerry Achieves NSA Approval for BlackBerry UEM](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-achieves-nsa-approval-blackberry-130000862.html) (11/18/20)
* [Plus Chooses BlackBerry to Power Its Class 8 Truck Automated Driving System First Self-Driving Truck Developer to Leverage Safety-Certified BlackBerry QNX Operating System](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/plus-chooses-blackberry-power-class-130000001.html) (11/17/20)
* [BlackBerry AtHoc Integrates with Microsoft Teams for Critical Event Management](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-athoc-integrates-microsoft-teams-123000549.html) (10/7/20)
* [BlackBerry AtHoc and ServiceNow Partner to Deliver Secure and Reliable Incident Response Management](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-athoc-servicenow-partner-deliver-120000305.html) (10/8/20)
* [BlackBerry Unveils Industry's First Unified Endpoint Security (UES) Solution for AI-powered Cybersecurity](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-unveils-industrys-first-unified-120000258.html) (10/6/20)
* [The United States Air Force Chooses BlackBerry Spark for Secure Productivity](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-states-air-force-chooses-120000017.html) (9/22/20)

Does this sounds like a phone manufacturer? Heck no!

And talk about being in the sweet spot. BlackBerry's flagship software, QNX, is embedded in more than 175 million cars, making it a foundational software platform for connected and autonomous vehicles. Just look at some of these names that BB can count as customers in the automotive space:

* Audi
* BMW
* Mercedes-Benz
* Toyota
* ARCFOX
* Xpeng
* Desay
* Canoo (yes, the EV maker merging into HCAC)
* Plus Self-Driving Trucks
* Arrival (yes, the EV company merging into CIIC)
* Jaguar Land Rover
* Damon Motorcycles
* Elektrobit
* Karma Automotive
* Tata

And on and on...

QNX is amazing, but there's more (and zero phones!)

**List of better known products**

*QNX*
A real-time embedded operating system, QNX drives multiple software systems in modern auto vehicles, and forms the basis of solutions like BlackBerry Radar, an IoT-based asset tracking system for the transportation industry. 

*Spark Suites*
Spark offers visibility and protection across all endpoints, including personal laptops and smartphones used for work. It leverages AI, machine learning and automation to provide improved cyber threat prevention. 

*AtHoc*
An emergency communication system, AtHoc provides two-way messaging and notifications across a range of devices and platforms.

*Unified Endpoint Manager (UEM)*
An enterprise mobility management platform that provides provisional and access control over smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops with support for all major platforms including iOS, Android (including Android for Work and Samsung KNOX), BlackBerry 10, Windows 10, and Mac OS.

*SecuSUITE*
An anti-eavesdropping solution that provides voice, data, and SMS encryption.

**Patents, patents and more patents!**

BB has 38K+ patents! They have been actively protecting them when they've been infringed upon.

For example, in 2017, BB was awarded a staggering $940,000,000 in overpayments of royalty payments against Qualcomm.

And for FB haters (count me in!) BB sued Facebook (along with WhatsApp and Instagram) in 2018, alleging that many critical features of the Facebook messaging service infringe on Blackberry patents. In the past two weeks Facebook LOST their challenge to the mobile messaging patent lawsuit in a final decision, paving the way toward a settlement for 'rent due' for use. Time to pay up, Zuck!!

**Recent refinancing & the Importance of $6**

In late summer this year Blackberry entered into a convertible financing with a pre-existing large shareholder for $365MM. The Debentures are convertible at $6 and would effectively bring this shareholder's exposure on a fully converted basis to just under 20% ownership.

The shareholder would then be fully aligned with minority shareholders, thus causing support at the $6 level going forward.

**Stock & Valuation**

* Stock closed at $5.91 on Wednesday (a six month high)
* The stock is trading 14% below its 52 week high of $6.89
* It's trading above its 50 and 200 DMA
* Market cap: $3.21B
* Revenue: $1.01B
* Price/Sales: 3.3x
* Float: 502MM
* Shares short: 30MM (11/13/20)

The best known publicly traded competitor in the connected & autonomous vehicle software space is Cerence.

CRNC (Cerence)
* Market cap: $3.24B
* Revenue: $329MM
* Price/Sales: 9.58x

The best known publicly traded competitors in cybersecurity are:

CRWD (Crowdstrike)
* Market cap: $31.98B
* Revenue: $654MM
* Price/Sales: 40.43x

FTNT (Fortinet)
* Market cap: $19.17B
* Revenue: $2.46B
* Price/Sales: 8.18x

PANW (Palo Alto Networks)
* Market cap: $28.19B
* Revenue: $3.58B
* Price/Sales: 7.98x

FEYE (FireEye)
* Market cap: $3.24B
* Revenue: $928MM
* Price/Sales: 3.37x

Taking out the richly valued CRWD and weakly valued FEYE leaves a combination of CRNC, FTNT and PANW to measure where BB stacks up. The average P/S of those three is 8.58x, whereas BB's P/S is 3.3x. This means that BB's P/S should float up to their level just to be in line with peers.

That would bring the stock price to just over $15, all else equal.

*We are at the critical $6 level today.*

> # 1. Dow set to add to Wednesday‚Äôs record despite Capitol turmoil

> * U.S. stock futures rose Thursday, a day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high despite the turmoil at the Capitol. Early Thursday, outgoing President Donald Trump said in a statement there ‚Äúwill be an orderly transition‚Äù of power, shortly after Congress confirmed President-elect Joe Biden‚Äôs win.

> * Economists expect an increase in initial jobless claims, when the Labor Department reports its weekly numbers at 8:30 a.m. ET. With the seven-day average of new daily U.S. Covid infections spiking to a record high, first-time filings for unemployment benefits are seen rising by 28,000 to 815,000 for the week ended Jan. 2.

> * Ahead of Friday‚Äôs government employment report, the ADP‚Äôs look at December jobs trends at U.S. companies showed a contraction in private-sector positions for the first time since the early days of the coronavirus. Throughout most of the pandemic, the ADP estimates have been below the final government count.

*****

> # 2. 10-year Treasury yield above 1%; bitcoin above $38,000

> * The 10-year Treasury yield remained above 1% on Thursday morning after projected wins for Democrats in both Senate runoff elections in Georgia. Lightening up on bonds, pushing prices down and yields up, investors bought riskier assets like stocks and bitcoin.

> * The world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency smashed through the $38,000 mark to hit a record high on Thursday as it continued its massive rally. Bitcoin has been up about 29% in the first days of 2021 and is up 380% over the past 12 months.

*****

> # 3. Congress confirms Biden as next president

> * Congress early Thursday confirmed the Electoral College vote for Biden, a day after Trump supporters breached the Capitol in a chaotic effort to avoid the formal recognition that the president lost the election. Shortly after the confirmation, White House spokesman Dan Scavino tweeted Trump‚Äôs statement, which promised ‚Äúan orderly transition on January 20th,‚Äù the day of Biden‚Äôs inauguration, but also perpetuated the baseless claim that he actually won.

> * Congress‚Äô process of counting Electoral College votes was interrupted Wednesday afternoon when rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol building. A woman who was among the invaders was shot and killed by Capitol Police. Three other people died from medical emergencies.

*****

> # 4. U.S. trade group asks Pence to ‚Äòseriously consider‚Äô invoking 25th Amendment

> * The National Association of Manufacturers, a trade organization representing 14,000 U.S. companies, called on Vice President Mike Pence to ‚Äúseriously consider‚Äù invoking the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to remove Trump from office. Jay Timmons, CEO of the manufacturers group, is a former executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Two Democratic U.S. representatives worked on a letter to Pence requesting he invoke the amendment.

> * Members of Trump‚Äôs Cabinet issued harsh rebukes of the violence that unfolded at the Capitol. The officials, however, stopped short of criticizing the president, who had urged his supporters to take action at a pro-Trump rally Wednesday morning.

> * An administration official confirmed to CNBC‚Äôs Eamon Javers that National Security Advisor Robert O‚ÄôBrien and Deputy National Security Advisor Matthew Pottinger are considering resigning over the insurrection. Stephanie Grisham, chief of staff for first lady Melania Trump, and Sarah Matthews, White House deputy press secretary, both resigned Wednesday.

> * Mick Mulvaney, Trump‚Äôs former chief of staff, announced on CNBC on Thursday he is resigning as special envoy to Northern Ireland.

*****

> # 5. Democrats win the majority in the Senate

> * During the Capitol siege, Democrat Jon Ossoff was projected as the winner of the second of two Senate runoff elections Tuesday in Georgia. The defeat of Republican David Perdue, whose Senate term expired Sunday, coupled with Democrat Raphael Warnock‚Äôs projected victory over Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, splits the 100 Senate right down the middle. However, Democrats take over the majority as Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the tie-breaking vote. After Biden‚Äôs inauguration, Democrats will control the Senate, House and the White House.

2019-10-12 04:09:17,Instagram's ($FB) new Threads app is a failure. Buy Snapchat ($SNAP).,"Three days ago I made a post that said, ""Instagram's new Threads app was an insta-flop.""
Yesterday, [Business Insider pointed out the same.](https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-threads-app-sees-low-downloads-compared-to-igtv-boomerang-2019-10) 

Snapchat took a really hard hit because of the release of Threads. Now that it looks like Threads is a bigger disappointment than us, expect an analyst or two to increase their thoughts on Snapchat. This is Facebook's upteenth attempt to take Snapchat out of the running, but it looks like Snapchat is here to stay. It's like Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. 

Moreover, Snapchat's stock price took another big hit recently when it was reported that they had server issues two days ago. Last time this happened it reached $17 (Average Analyst Price) after a few days. It now sits at $14.22. Something I can't forget to mention is Snapchat's potential to grow.

As it it stands, Millennials slightly favor Instagram's Story option. However, Generation Z favors Snapchat's storys. [When it comes to Generation Z 73% of them said that consume Snapchat storys and 70% of them said that they also consume Instagram's storys. This is compared to Millennials' 53% for Snapchat and 58% for Instagram.](https://imgur.com/gallery/Wd9UUy0)
Additionally, when it comes to where they create stories, the numbers for [Generation Z are 58% for Snapchat and 39% for Instagram. This is compared to Millennials' 34% for Snapchat and 31% for Instagram.](https://imgur.com/gallery/XroGmrs)(Check out the graphs if it's too wordy for you.)
What does this mean?

All Millennials (1980-1994) are of age to decide what platform they want to use. However, that isn't the case for Generation Z (1995-2015) where the youngest of the generation are just 4 years old. Every year, millions of young people from Generation Z will flock to Snapchat when they become the appropriate age to use the platform. 

In conclusion, Snapchat's stock price was recently hurt because of the release of Instagram's Threads app, which was a flop, and a recent server issue. The last time it had server issues that were repaired, shares skyrocketed. Moreover, you should hold Snapchat because it will continue to garner millions of more years a year because it's Generation Z's preferred platform for stories. As more and more people from Generation Z come of age to start using Snapchat, Snapchat will see more and more users. I'm setting my price at $22.

2020-10-21 10:28:11,Volatility for Dummies: VXX UVXY VXX and SPY Correlation Explained (poorly),"
**The most basic thing to know is that VIX (so VXX and UVXY by extension) is a measurement of market volatility, not SPY performance.**¬† Let's say you buy a bunch of AAPL options of one month expiry at an implied volatility (IV) of 50 and FB at an IV of 20, but you have them ending up the same percentage higher at the strike price of your one month expiry--let's say 5% higher.¬† The logic is that, due to historical and current factors, AAPL is expected to bounce around in much higher and lower swings to reach that 5%--a wilder journey, but the same destination.¬† The volatility of that journey is what VIX represents, on an extrapolated level, for SPY as a whole.¬† Think of it like this--VIX is the measurement of IV for the market as a whole, rather than for an individual equity. Because of this...

**VIX does not have to always directly inverse SPY, but instead just often does‚Äî80% of the time.** VIX can rise with SPY--or fall with SPY--it's just not as common as inversing SPY.¬† It can also do it's own thing entirely.¬† Certain sectors can be performing one way, and SPY another, and these performances factor into the underlying measurements to prevent a break with SPY due to weighting and a shitload of other factors.¬† SPY can climb rapidly, and volatility can rise with it, because the sharp movement creates just as much variation chaos in the underlyings as a precipitous drop would.

**VIX is represented as an annualized standard deviation number within SPY.**¬† If VIX is 25, for example, it is estimating movement of 25% in price action in SPY over the course of the next year.¬† It was above 50 during the March crash, which, when you think about it in those terms, is nuts.

¬† **VIX is a monthly price estimation based on SPY options premiums.**¬† SPY trades on it's underlyings and is also tradeable in and of itself, whereas VIX is vessel for trading a bundle of spreads, for lack of a better term.¬† This is a mathematical--even theoretical--estimate on future market movement based on how much premium people are willing to pay for S&P options, or in other words, it is an estimate of market volatility based on how much money people are willing to pay for insurance on their stocks.¬†¬†Equity prices are ONLY as important here inasmuch as they effect the pricing of the equity options. The more people are willing to pay for options, the higher VIX goes.

**VIX is NOT the in-the-moment measurement of the underlying SPY put/call option spread‚Äîit is¬†forward looking to the monthy expiration**.¬†¬†In the case of VIX this is a minimum of 23 days and up to 37 days out, with weighting favored toward the one month expiration.¬† The math is crazy and intricate, on some Rainman shit, but the important thing to know is that VIX isn't a prisoner of the moment, but instead a look at the coming one month landscape taking in all factors over that course in time.

*Real life example*: Many people have been expecting VIX to be much higher as we head into an election, but if we think of it in forward-looking, weighted terms, this moment may have passed--at least as far as the election is concerned.¬† VIX is taking into consideration, at the moment,¬† the perceived calmer times beginning toward the end of November after the election.¬† If you go back and look at VIX values about one month prior to the election date, you can see that VIX was at it's peak on October 5th and 6th, reaching appproximately $30.¬† This would correlate with the expected movement weighted one month from that day, or in other words, peak fear a day or two after the election.

**Volatility is volatile, and therefore not a buy and hold**: VIX associates VXX and UVXY are known for making people rich on days like June 11th, or in September, when they suddenly climb 10, 15, 20% in a single day or a two day stretch.¬† Yes, this a large part of it's appeal.¬† But the real reason people get rich is that VIX IV can climb high--fast--because it's price movements are not considered lasting and great fluctuation becomes priced in.¬† IV shoots up on these things like crazy, which means that the value of your VIX options shoots up like crazy.¬† BUT, value also falls like crazy too, and it has intense theta burn (cost appreciation of the asset over time). So, while you are sitting around waiting to make your million dollar play with a VXX monthly you are losing a lot of money in the process.¬† The VIX knows this, and it smells your weakness, and the day after you've dumped it because you've bled 50% it will rocket to new heights.¬† Because of this...

**VIX, VXX, and UVXY are meant as loss strategies and hedges, but not as outright plays.**¬† Unless you are some Burry level TA specialist, or maybe my guy /u/winnning007, and you can pinpoint when certain events are going to happen or the market response within a day or two, you're best to keep a smaller amount as a hedge rather than go all in.¬† The road to bagholding is short and full of terrors with volatility plays. B**UY SPY PUTS INSTEAD IF YOU ARE BEARISH**

**VIX VXX and UVXY‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-**

So all that is cool, but VIX is a futures instrument and not a daily tradeable ETF/ETN; *enter VXX and UVXY.*¬† To keep it simple, I'm going to lump the two together and just say that UVXY is a more levered version of VXX.¬† So UVXY can climb higher than VXX when it rises, and fall lower than VXX when it falls.¬† For the purposes of this explanation, I'm going to focus on VXX, but bottom line--if you don't really know what you're doing/aren't confident in your volatility move, stick with VXX rather than UVXY.¬† The money is still good, don't be a hero.

**VXX tracks the performance of VIX, but offers different expirations** (weekly ETF settlement dates like Friday/Saturday rather than the Wednesday of monthly futures), and tracks it at about a 50% level.¬† In other words, if the VIX monthly futures have an 8% jump, expect about 4% for VXX monthlies.¬† VXX is also an ETN, not an ETF--this is important because it means that it must have a direct tracking of the VIX unlike a fund which isn't beholden to a certain rate of correlation.¬† In other words, VXX MUST track that ~50% of the VIX for efficacy.

**What‚Äôs important here**: VIX is the futures estimate bundle, and VXX is not VIX, but it is a¬†very reliable tracker of VIX price movements with few notable exceptions.¬† UVXY is kind of like a levered version of VXX, meant to track with higher returns. These two can and do at times move out of sync with VIX due to something called contango.

*If you want to go in depth on the intricacies of their relationship and contango and shit, I won‚Äôt do that here, but this is a good resource:* https://www.schaeffersresearch.com/content/news/2015/02/04/the-messy-relationship-between-vix-and-vxx

**Manipulation**

Whenever VXX doesn't move with SPY, I bitterly joke that it's illegal and manipulated.¬† This wayward movement is actually more due to the natural variance I pointed out earlier, but there is some truth to it.¬† CBOE--the VIX providers--have been sued a few times over the past few years due to alleged manipulation of VIX.¬† Of note, the ""Father of VIX"" as one article called it's creator, was one of the whistleblowers alleging fraud.¬† The case was recently thrown out again, but the accusations speak for themselves.

>	The plaintiffs, traders in VIX-based products, filed a lawsuit alleging that certain features of the settlement process made it especially susceptible to manipulation but that Cboe chose not to enforce its rules against manipulation so it could continue to profit from the VIX products. Specifically, the complaint alleged violations of the Exchange Act antifraud provisions and the CEA and brought claims against both Cboe and anonymous ""Doe"" defendants that allegedly manipulated the settlement values for VIX options and futures by manipulating the two-zero-bid rule and employing a process analogous to ""banging the close.""

So, ya know, innocent until proven guilty, but there is a lot of info out there to suggest that a lot of people invested in--and involved in the creation of--VIX through CBOE think it's manipulated.¬† That can't be ignored.

**Other tidbits to note:**
A lot of little things matter with VIX; Quadruple witching dates, portfolio rebalancing dates, Congressional hearings with the FED, release of beige books, stress tests, and FOMC are all catalysts for VXX/UVXY activity if you're searching for short dated FD plays.¬† Just look at the financial calendar on the FED website or Marketwatch, etc., before you make any moves against volatility. You're one JPOW speech to congress away from the big GUH.

2020-07-14 10:30:51,DDDD - Will We See A Second Great Lockdown?,"In today's DDDD (data-driven DD), after a long hiatus due to less free time, we'll take another broad view of the current state of the United States economy and public health. We‚Äôll be looking at some data to answer a few questions. Namely, what the state of the pandemic is globally and in the United States, whether or not we will have a second Great Lockdown (yes, historians are now calling this [the Great Lockdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_recession)), statistics on the resumption of economic activity, and the looming unemployment and eviction crisis, and how this all might affect the stock market.

**COVID-19 Data**

On face value, we can see the number of confirmed cases rising exponentially again in the United States, after a flattening of new cases during the lockdown.

[New cases by country](https://preview.redd.it/0ppbgmjkuua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8364b49db7f55f39ec285f7aec731eda1b83f1d4)

This is in contrast to countries like New Zealand, which has been declared COVID-19 free for several weeks, and much of Europe which has significantly reduced new cases and has even reopened for tourism. Within the US, the previous epicenter, New York, has seen a drastic reduction in new cases and is moving towards re-opening.

[NY New Cases](https://preview.redd.it/uww1vjlwuua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0df5aff508e31aa0450e33459a2a2790e5eb505b)

On the other hand, another exponential rise in confirmed cases have been seen in several other states that have fully reopened, including California, Texas, and Florida, the three largest states in the union.

[California New Cases](https://preview.redd.it/969nv8hzuua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=e227e2a481190f3e4d3a28e777a217b19e8ea256)

[Texas New Cases](https://preview.redd.it/7kiy7rv0vua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bcdcc26e402e1456088cb1792a0b4d434522691)

[Florida New Cases](https://preview.redd.it/khrmq322vua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a3f4efe562bcf5d5995747a8042e248d153e3dd)

Part of the increase in new confirmed cases can be attributed to more widespread testing within these states, so we‚Äôll have to look at confirmed deaths to really see if things are getting much worse. If deaths weren‚Äôt rising, then the increase in cases could even be considered good news because this implies excessive testing and a much lower case fatality rate than expected.

[California New Deaths](https://preview.redd.it/t6970z73vua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=afc9073e0e402a6c1f6537478e09536c1bbba3df)

[Texas New Deaths](https://preview.redd.it/b7l6gke4vua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=74f3dacdfd5f0e73967cb4e97bce3c80846b323d)

[Florida New Deaths](https://preview.redd.it/ticc80p5vua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1b829f5bf0ae83bde766042de8cc7fba5a615fb)

It looks like there is a true increase in cases within these states. Keep in mind that the new deaths statistics will lag behind the new infections rate by several weeks. The new deaths rate has just started increasing exponentially again at the beginning of July, and this will become even worse, even if governors impose new lockdowns and restrictions because of the delay.

**Will a Second Lockdown Happen?**

The second question to ask is if there will be a second wave of lockdowns. California recently just announced a [rollback in the lifting of restrictions](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/13/california-to-close-indoor-restaurants-movie-theaters-and-bars-statewide-as-coronavirus-cases-rise.html&sa=D&ust=1594749851411000&usg=AOvVaw2qxWTtCYwlbOxvW8cvVKT6)¬†in response to the new increase in cases, setting a precedent for other states to follow suit. However, whether or not there will be a second wave of lockdowns in states is unclear, and depends on several key factors.

*Mask Usage*

Despite initial opposition from health officials telling the public masks do not work, there has been a reversal in messaging, and the government is now encouraging people to wear masks in public. [Even Trump is wearing one in public now](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/opinion/letters/coronavirus-trump-mask.html&sa=D&ust=1594749851412000&usg=AOvVaw0Yj5a4KXhVBc67mi8IEf5m), especially since there is no longer a shortage. The scientific consensus seems to be that surgical masks are effective in preventing the wearer from transmitting COVID-19 to others if they are sick, but not so effective from having the wearer catch it. This has worked in many other countries, especially in Asia, where people might be publicly shamed or shunned for not wearing a mask and potentially exposing others to COVID-19, which explains why places such as Japan and Taiwan have never seen real widespread transmission. However, in the US there is [significant opposition towards mask wearing](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/12/health/california-lifts-mask-requirement-trnd/index.html&sa=D&ust=1594749851412000&usg=AOvVaw38DVurc7sTHBNetNmD_FO2), and wearing mandates may not be widely followed in some states. According to [one study](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.09.20096644v2&sa=D&ust=1594749851413000&usg=AOvVaw3k20celrv3_h--S1KA8gCR), the critical mask adoption rate is calculated to be approximately 73% for the epidemic to be contained. If states are able to successfully convince their population to start wearing masks in public, above that rate, then a second lockdown will not be needed. However, even with a [mask mandate](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/19/us/california-coronavirus-face-covering-order/index.html&sa=D&ust=1594749851413000&usg=AOvVaw3JdCcj0ul9-vtCuYeAPnS3)¬†in California in all places where social distancing is not possible being enacted a month ago, it does not seem to have been widely followed enough to prevent a rise in new cases and deaths. My personal opinion is that most people are now desensitized to COVID-19 news, and no longer care enough to wear masks in public, and hence the 73% critical adoption rate will not be met in most states, even if there is a mandate implemented.

*Political Opinion*

Especially important as it‚Äôs an election year, a new wave of lockdowns will likely be dependent on the political popularity of it. I wasn‚Äôt able to find any reliable recent polls about it, but based on media and political discourse, it looks like the concern right now is more with saving the economy, with the population desensitized towards COVID-19 deaths. A Single Death is a Tragedy; a Million Deaths is a Statistic. This famous quote can be applied to virtually every natural disaster and massacre. Nobody cared about COVID-19 until March when suddenly Tom Hanks and NBA players were diagnosed with it. Everyone then started panicking and raided their local grocery store to buy up all the toilet paper (for some reason). So what will make people care about the pandemic again?

*ICU Beds*

This is probably the best indicator for when things will go crazy. Once enough hospitals run out of ICU beds to treat COVID-19 patients, they will start having to turn away patients and the case fatality rate will skyrocket. This will likely cause a media frenzy and re-instill widespread panic, shifting political opinion towards more lockdowns. How close are we to this? This statistic is much harder to collect data on and interpret because available ICU beds tend to be fragmented. Since it‚Äôll be logistically difficult to relocate patients to the other side of a state if all the ICU beds in one county fills up, what matters isn‚Äôt necessarily how many beds are available in the state, but how many hospitals in each county have reached capacity. Since that‚Äôs much harder to interpret and find data on, we'll just look at the available ICU headroom, which does not include potential extra beds that may be created in response to COVID-19.

[California ICU Headroom](https://preview.redd.it/3sdx8la7vua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa5ec78a13e1f26ecf308fad9544bcec1bad0e32)

[Texas ICU Headroom](https://preview.redd.it/5l8h71vbvua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=796ed67e262d180aae0270e4db3bb64da28237a4)

[Florida ICU Headroom](https://preview.redd.it/klgx21bevua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0c21f85eb21bcbb8b0e11394fde26a2c191851a)

From this data, California‚Äôs pretty much safe, while Texas‚Äô is close to running out of beds and Florida has pretty much reached capacity.

Another thing to keep in mind is that it will be much more difficult to solve the lack of ICU beds in these states compared to New York. The vast majority of the state‚Äôs population live at or near New York City, which is densely populated (in case you‚Äôre geographically deficient). This means the problem can easily be solved by simply adding a bunch of beds in one central location, and sending a hospital ship to one place. This can‚Äôt really be done in more sparsely populated states like Texas and Florida. Based on this data, we‚Äôll likely see some panic about COVID-19 again in the coming weeks with ICU beds running out in multiple states.

**The Reopening, Oil, and Economic Activity**

[The state of reopening](https://preview.redd.it/zdz0zq3hvua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a47986120b693fc8dcd6b61cc30aac48cec595f)

In general, the north east, which was the hardest hit in March, is still in the process of rolling back restrictions, with most other states having already fully reopened. However, many of the new hot spots, like California, Florida, and Texas, are starting to impose new restrictions. The stock market is starting to realize this, with a selloff happening once California announced a complete rollback of re-opening, closing all indoor dining in the state, and there‚Äôs fears that the other hotspot states might follow suit.

[New Jobless Claims](https://preview.redd.it/xlnulkljvua51.png?width=1596&format=png&auto=webp&s=82f15416b73529866b809f98a43e10fb8295e88a)

With a few weeks of many states completely reopening we‚Äôre now able to see what the best case scenario for the economy would be. Although dramatically reduced from April highs, there‚Äôs still over 1 million new joblessness claims per week, way above pre-pandemic figures. Furthermore, these new joblessness claims have stopped decreasing and are starting to slowly rise back up again, and this is with most of the economy re-opened. Since full reopening in many states are still recent, we don‚Äôt have other economic indicators, such as personal savings rate and consumer confidence to see if people are actually re-engaged in the economy or people are still avoiding economic activity out of fear of COVID-19.

Another thing I‚Äôve been keeping an eye on for a while is crude oil stocks. Despite a rally back up from the (negative) lows on the May contract, WTI has been struggling to break $40 and recover to pre-COVID levels, although being near it. While digging through some data [provided weekly by the EIA](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/data.php&sa=D&ust=1594749851416000&usg=AOvVaw3bDA78iR9amTL3rriK4Wvl), I noticed something interesting with crude oil stocks - despite re-opening, it‚Äôs still increasing.

[Crude Oil Stored \(kbbl\)](https://preview.redd.it/xdgrc3hlvua51.png?width=1378&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f7694baf5c7b8143c091f38778b736530820382)

Except for one small dip in the middle of May, crude oil stocks have been slowly rising throughout this entire re-opening, despite many oil producers cutting back capacity. Worse yet, an OPEC meeting scheduled later this week is expected to [relax production cuts](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/13/oil-markets-opec-in-focus.html&sa=D&ust=1594749851416000&usg=AOvVaw3uuF8qeo1DP2VKiGuOkdQg), putting even more crude oil into the supply. Excluding the SPR (Strategic Petroleum Reserve), the story looks slightly less scary for commercial producers.

[Crude Oil Stored for Commercial Use \(kbbl\)](https://preview.redd.it/csen71vqvua51.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&s=485df51d36c9a6262d8c42156d68c81971ad0cd8)

This however does not mean we‚Äôre going to be seeing negative oil futures again, since producers have gotten smarter about avoiding a storage squeeze in Cushing.

[Crude Oil Stored for Commercial Use @ Cushing \(kbbl\)](https://preview.redd.it/awlcjzcxvua51.png?width=1362&format=png&auto=webp&s=275b43ecabc5521978002db198c099f8f1bf5b49)

Refinery utilization, although steadily increasing, is still significantly below pre-pandemic levels.

[Refinery Utilization Rate](https://preview.redd.it/s1l8rl40wua51.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b8926c8faf1baf3282c6b2dd530ece560ebe29e)

The conclusion that can be drawn from this is that oil-based economic activity (i.e. travel and energy usage), while increasing, is still well below what it was in February. Crude oil producers however, are still outproducing what refineries are taking in, and crude stocks have been steadily increasing throughout the entire reopening despite increasing oil prices.

**The Looming Housing Crisis**

Another thing to mention is the ticking time bomb that is the expiration of the unemployment boost provided by the federal government on July 31, and the eviction crisis coming our way as eviction courts reopen and process them. Mortgage forbearances are also starting to expire, with around 8% of all [active mortgages in forbearance](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/10/coronavirus-mortgage-bailout-sees-biggest-one-week-decline-yet.html&sa=D&ust=1594749851418000&usg=AOvVaw2JRDx43Q0y7IYcupImyxDZ). According to [one source](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/08/32-percent-of-us-households-missed-their-july-housing-payments.html&sa=D&ust=1594749851418000&usg=AOvVaw24JU1zP70LJmgOsUopIb3Q), 36% of renters and 30% of homeowners did not pay their full housing payment in time. This will probably take a few months to really see the effects of this, but it‚Äôs definitely something to consider.

**How This Might Affect Stocks**

We‚Äôre already seeing the first waves of bankruptcies, mostly from companies that were already in a poor financial position like Hertz, JCPenny, and GNC. For the bull case, most of the rally for the past few months have mostly been concentrated in tech stocks, which are much less directly affected by the pandemic, with some companies like Amazon even benefitting from it. They‚Äôre usually very financially healthy, and can easily operate in a pandemic, if not benefitting from it. In fact, some stocks like AMZN, TSLA, ZM, and SHOP have gone parabolic in the past few weeks, which is usually not a good sign. On the bear case, most economists predict a prolonged U-shaped or L-shaped economic recovery, and a wave of bankruptcies for companies that couldn‚Äôt be rescued by the Fed. As mentioned above, I also believe we‚Äôre going to be seeing a second wave of lockdowns in the coming weeks as ICU beds start running out, making the economic situation even worse. Eventually, a shrinking economy, mass unemployment, and reduced spending will ultimately hurt the earnings of even the tech stocks. GOOG and FB earnings ultimately rely on businesses buying ads. AMZN and SHOP earnings rely on consumers buying things. Another argument for the bull side is that due to monetary policies such as QE and 0% treasury yields, along with the unattractiveness of emerging markets in the current economic climate, there is a [massive modern savings glut](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/straub/files/mss_richsavingglut.pdf&sa=D&ust=1594749851419000&usg=AOvVaw0ThBvbFFnJeTPQWxsBHFQQ)¬†\- money that has nowhere else to go. This by itself could take another essay to explain, so I might talk about this more in a future post.

**My Positions**

For those that have been following me the past few months, my positions remain unchanged. After briefly joining the bulls for a few weeks, then ü¶ògang, I've now converted back to a üåàüêª. My only major position right now are VIX calls, with July, Aug, and Sept expiry, which I entered a few weeks ago when VIX was at 26. There's a few reasons for this - I still believe in my [long-term thesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcfn5/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble/) that the stock market is in a bubble, with the past few months accelerating the inflation of it, and my belief that the US will eventually mishandle the COVID-19 response, forcing the government to lockdown again once ICU beds run out. I'm no longer day trading, and will swing trade my current positions when a good selling opportunity comes - I'll keep this post updated if I sell.",1879,0.97

All we're doing here is buying the underlying shares, and hedging this long position with Jan21 $145 puts, which we're financing by selling Jan21 $210 covered calls (for a total net hedging cost of just $0.20).  By utilizing the newly released Jan. 2021 LEAPs, we're seizing on some of the typical new-issue pricing anomalies, which allows us to lock in a nice little discount/premium to the current implied value of these options (we're getting our put at a 6.4% discount, and selling our call at a 2.5% premium. in each case to current implied value).

I think weak hands will drive price down all day tomorrow, the earnings report will come out stellar, and price will rise like crazy afterward. I believe historically every time FB comes out with positive earnings we see a large spike in price.
