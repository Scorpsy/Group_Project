What do you guys think is the fair market value now?

I, along with everyone else, was disappointed as this could have been a life-changer for a disease with no current therapies. Will be interesting to see the actual clinical data that drove the decision. Personally I'm seeing this as a buying opportunity as Ionis has many others in the pipeline, including multiple for ALS. Like their flagship drug Nusinersen, if any of these others hit, it could be the sole therapy for these devastating diseases.",20,0.81
