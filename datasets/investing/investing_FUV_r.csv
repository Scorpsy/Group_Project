Many other companies (especially SPACs) with fewer vehicles produced/sold to date and less clear plans to scale have multi-billion dollar valuations. For example, Nikola ($NKLA) $5B, Lordstown ($RIDE) $2B, and Workhorse ($WKHS) $1.7B.

In the last year, Arcimoto produced and sold \~100 vehicles to customers. They are planning to scale production capacity to 50k/year in 2022 in their new factory. Some companies valued over $1B still mainly have drawings and a couple of prototypes.

Arcimoto's produces inexpensive, 3-wheeled vehicles which makes them less of a direct competitor with Tesla ($TSLA). Direct competition from Tesla poses a real risk to the profitability of other EV players long term.

Arcimoto has gained pretty good traction and support from the Tesla community with Gali from Hyperchange on Arcimoto's board, their partnership with Sandy Munro, and Rob Mauer (Tesla Daily podcast) and Ross Gerber disclosing investments in $FUV.

On the other hand, many people are betting against Arcimoto's success with 23.59% of the float sold short as of 3/15 according to Yahoo Finance.",13,0.69
