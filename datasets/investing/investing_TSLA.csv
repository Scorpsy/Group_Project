2021-02-12 15:14:42,"Why Cathie Wood might be right, and why TSLA is actually STILL fairly or even undervalued at these levels.","""Analysts have been calling the stock “overvalued” since the day they went public, because they all keep comparing it to other car companies. I wish I had a dollar for every analyst who pointed out how “*every other car company sells ten times as many cars*”. 

 I’ve also repeatedly bumped into some lazy analysis that Tesla is expensive because its current P/E is 1,270x or forward P/E is 204x. However, I’ve hardly ever seen a Tesla bear put out a detailed valuation in support of their bearish thesis which makes me wonder if a lot of people are simply dismissing Tesla in arrogance.

But the thing is, they’re all making the same mistake:

**Tesla isn’t a car company.**

They’re an energy and technology and SaaS company that makes cars.

Once you realize what Tesla really is, you start to see what their place in the market is going to be in the years to come.

They acquired Grohmann Engineering. They acquired Perbox. They acquired Maxwell Technologies and Hibar Systems. And of course everyone remembers the Solar City acquisition back before dropping Motors from their name. They didn’t acquire these companies because they thought they were cool. They did it so nobody else could.

* There are 25,000 EV charging stations in the United States. 20,000 of them are owned by Tesla.
* Tesla is currently the #1 li-ion battery manufacturer in America, and #5 in the world.
* Tesla has secured the rights to large supplies of lithium, and has developed their own internal process for extracting lithium deposits inexpensively from other sources.

These segments of the energy space — battery production and EV charging — are a market sector that’s going to grow 50 fold in the next 15 years as consumer demand for EV’s increases. All of the major auto manufacturers have declared they’re shifting towards electric cars.

Where are they going to get the batteries? How are their customers going to charge them?

The answer: Tesla.

Musk has made it clear from the beginning that their intent is to supply batteries for the entire EV *industry*, not just their own cars, and has also more or less come out and said that he’s open to letting other auto manufacturers access their Supercharger network. That puts them squarely in the energy business as the single most capable distributor.

There’s also been chatter about licensing their self-driving technology, and using their self-driving technology as a recurring revenue generation, which would be a very attractive value-add for the other OEM’s. And all of these things don’t even begin to cover the expected growth in residential energy with products like rooftop solar, Powerwall, etc.""

2021-01-06 18:53:47,TSLA - Tesla market value today is more valuable than all the world's major auto makers combined - what gives?,"Tesla market value today (716 Billion) is about the same as  the market value of all the world's major car makers combined.  In addition China's BYDDY (86B) and Nio (78B) are both more valuable than Daimler (74B) even though NIO only delivered less than 40,000 cars in all of 2020 with huge loss. China's LI and XPEV combined market value are similar to GM (61B), which has production in China and has a worldwide lineup of EV to be on the market in the next few years.

With the exception of autonomous driving, EV manufacturing appears to have a low technology barrier to entry, that's why we have so many EV car companies pops up all over the world. Everybody used the same Total Addressable Market to justify their future value. I don't think autonomous driving is a must have in buying an EV, so the competition will be intense once all ICV companies start to produce their lineup of EVs in the near future.

Since Auto industry is a cyclical business, historically, the market value of the auto companies were somewhat depressed as compared to other high growth industries. Since there is a limit on how many cars will be sold in a year based on historical trends, I don't know how we can justify doubling or tripling the total market value of the whole auto industry unless all the non-Tesla companies lost significant amount of their market value, which is not likely (you are talking about fierce competitors like Toyota, Daimler, Honda, GM, etc)

The first movers (Tesla, BYDDY, Nio, Xpev) are catching all the investment dollars, driving their stock to current nose bleeding price.  Once all major car makers start to deliver EVs, supply and demand will determine their profit margin, future cash flow and true present value.

What do you think? How long will this EV mania last?",1789,0.94
2020-12-31 08:34:35,Are there any historical examples of stocks behaving similarly to TSLA for such a long time?,"I think (most) people would agree that TSLA is largely overvalued right now and has been for some time. But unlike typical bubble examples, TSLA's price has never really burst like a lot of people expected, and continues to look strong.

Would appreciate specific examples if you have any, thanks!",961,0.95
2021-01-02 06:44:51,Pricing everything as if they are the next AMZN (TSLA story),"One of the things that amazes me currently in this market is that, it feels like we are trying to justify every new coming hot tech/growth company as if they are the next AMZN in their field. I think one of the delusions people are having lately is that they look at what people projected for AMZN 5-10-15 years ago and compare that to what actually happened.

While it is true that AMZN exceeded any sort of expectation by a huge margin (and did this consistently, year over year) it feels to me that we are taking perhaps one of the most unique success stories ever and then extrapolate that to others, thinking that as if those sort of growth and expectations are in fact more common and easy to achieve than not, regardless of the industry the subject company is operating in.

I could discuss this for a number of stocks, I wanted to open discussion for TSLA. As we all know, TSLA stock went up almost 8 fold in the last year. Today, it is common occurrence in the market that analysts are justifying these price levels and state why TSLA is just more than a car company. This argument obviously has its own merits, but aren't we little ahead ourselves and already attribute *from today,* all those things that could potentially be achieved and bake it into the price?

If we went back in in time, we could probably say AMZN was more than just a book company, but could we really say that they would have almost monopolistic power in most of the areas they operated in? Could we really say back in 2008 that AMZN would emerge the market leader in something like for instance Cloud? Or, did these things happen and then we realized how great AMZN became, *after the fact.* It feels like this was much easier to do in hindsight. But what if AMZN is truly that one outlier, anomaly, in the history of stock markets in terms of sustained growth and market power?

Isn't this what we are trying to do with TSLA here? I do think Elon is one of the greatest minds of our time and can achieve far beyond any other has achieved so I am not comparing Bezos or any other with Elon here. But what I am trying to say is that, just thinking TSLA as a company, aren't we already saying today that they already have monopolistic power in EV cars, autonomous driving, solar-energy trade, underground tunnels, robotaxis, etc. - you name it, as if they are already there and waiting to be switched on? It's as if we have already attributed everything we could imagine could happen and already announced TSLA as the winner.

Now this is the theory side of things. **How about financial side of things?**

I don't want to approach this from a car sales point of view, but I will make certain comments.

But what if we applied AMZN's growth trajectory into TSLA, without focusing too much on car sales, and just see what growth and valuation that would lead us? If TSLA is just more than a car company, what other example could serve best in terms of growth, thinking from an array of products and technological advantage perspective?

So I did a quick and dirty DCF calculation. In there, my starting point is the first year when AMZN hit $24 billion in revenue, which is 2009. TSLA achieved it's $24 billion in 2019, so from there onwards I am applying AMZN's growth trajectory for the following 10-11 years. Then, growth is gradually reduced in going into the terminal year. What this means is TSLA will be roughly $900 billion revenue generating company by year 20 (2040). From a car sales perspective, I can't really project how many cars it could sell in 20 years, but lets say it is 10 million cars. (I think GS said 15 million). Toyota in 2019 sold around this number I believe so with all the competition that will happen in this space, I think this is by no means and under-estimation. In 2019, TSLA sold roughly 367,500 cars and for a total revenue of $19.2 billion (excluding regulatory credits). On average this equates to $52k per car. In 20 years, car prices will be higher than what they are today obviously, but there will be competition and economies of scale to bring the price down. This one is hard to assume but let's say it grows 1.0% - 1.5% per year with long term inflation, again not necessarily higher because of these offsetting factors. If they do indeed sell 10+ million cars, this is roughly $600-650 billion from cars.

This leaves you with another $200-250 billion or so for other things, whatever you want to attribute this for - AI, robotaxies, insurance, and so on. Now this figure is a future value, so from today's perspective (using a discount rate of 8% used in my DCF below) that's roughly $60 billion (revenue). This is again a huge number, as it is almost another Facebook, 2x Coca-Cola etc., or half of GM/Toyota type business from revenue generating capability, again, from *today's perspective - none of which has already happened.*

Once again I want to point out that my revenue projections are not driven by bottoms-up car sales, rather, I am using simply AMZN trajectory in terms of growth, then try to attribute the resulting final revenue figure into parts, obviously majority being from car sales, and the rest from whatever you can think of. (Simply because we don't know what AI/Robos/Insurance/Transportation businesses can generate from revenue/profitability/market share perspective and more importantly what the competition in those areas can be). If you think TSLA can grow even more than AMZN, then I just want to remind you that you won't easily justify 40-50% revenue growth rates once you're in the 50+ billion zone, which is the point of the argument. AMZN, still achieved those growth rates when it had 100+ or 200+ billion, which is what we are already assuming here.

So in the stock price we have baked in, from a revenue perspective, a car business that will sell at least 10+ million cars (this number can obviously be higher but even 10 million will be big market share),  and other businesses that are worth, today, more than most companies you can think of.

Now this is the growth side of things. How about margins?

We know TSLA generated a last twelve months EBITDA margin of 14% as of Q3 2020. While margins from car manufacturing is certainly improving, most of this margin is actually attributed to sales of regulatory credits, which are by definition almost 100% profit. And so in reality, the margins are much lower, maybe around low single digits between 1-5%. Now this is important because even with all this revenue growth (and if you disagree with me and think it will even be higher), you still need to achieve big margins on your business. I mean really really good margins, we are talking about 15-25% each year. Interestingly, AMZN, while growing its top line crazily over the years and becoming a behemoth as it is today, always lacked in terms of their margins. That goes without saying they are a tech company that typically exhibit great returns on capital. So the point is they had to sacrifice their margins to be able to achieve this growth and this is an important point.

In my DCF, I am extremely generous. I kept TSLA's EBITDA margins at 15% for the next 3 years, bumped to 17.5%, 20.0%, then to finally 25.0% every 3 years in going forward. Once again these regulatory credits will not be there forever so those margins are extremely optimistic at this point. They might indeed achieve 25% margins in 10 years or so but it won't be this smooth.

With these two major factors, other items in the DCF are not super important. The discount rate is 8.0%, which I believe is reasonable, NWC and Capex assumptions are in line with what they are today and I don't think they would necessarily go down (if not go up). I just want to mention that you may completely disagree with some of the assumptions I outlined above. The point however is no matter what sort of DCF you come up with, you will end up either with lower or slight higher value for TSLA, using very, very aggressive assumptions for 10+ years. So the point and question is around the **margin of safety** here.

It seems I can't directly post pictures so here is the link for the DCF:

[https://ibb.co/mSHDcBh](https://ibb.co/mSHDcBh)

You might wonder, well your price is even higher than what it is today so why did you write this.

Once again my whole point in the argument was that the margin of error in TSLA's stock price right now is non-existent, because we've already treated it the next AMZN, gave the best margins possible, attributed big bucks on its other stuff. I think my DCF is still in the unreasonable side, but I wanted to point this out that even a s*light change in trajectory would mean a totally different path and stock price for TSLA.*

So the question is, are we ahead of ourselves with TSLA? This could also apply to others as well, this so called growth companies. It is as if we are pricing everything today and think that they have already achieved incredible market share in everything they touched and it's only a matter of time that these revenue/profits are realized. Are we taking one anomaly and applying this rationale for every other great company under the name of ""it's tech""? Elon is great and TSLA will be great. But the business model may not just allow them to be the next AMZN, regardless of technology or improvement.

One final comment I will make is related to autonomous driving and data TSLA is collecting. While it is for certain that this data gives TSLA an incredible power in developing this technology, I see couple of issues with this as it relates to future of this thing.

Companies such as Facebook are big not because of their software, but because of the network effects they exhibit. And because of those network effects they become larger and larger and are able to collect more data, which creates an incredibly profitable cycle for them as they can monetize that data right away. Data for TSLA here only matters in developing that technology. Monetization however, is another story.

What I am not entirely sure with all this AI story is that if it needs to continuously get updated for use, then how do regulators/companies determine the older version was safe to use to begin with. What I understand is that AI is something that needs to get constantly updated based on data, challenge here is that you are carrying people's lives here (as opposed to targeting ads) so there needs to be an infliction point where the full autonomous driving AI software should be at a point where it is certainly 100% safe to use. Because if it is not, then the technology fails until it reaches to that point. If it does reach out to that point, then how difficult is it going to be for others to get to that point or use similar technology if what you need is to get from point A to B safely.

Besides there is the price factor in as well. Let's say TSLA is the only one who can do this. If autonomous driving is too expensive, then how much will people pay for it? Say if the car is 50k and you have to pay extra 50k on top of that - would you do this? Would this have a cannibalization effect? Or if it is monthly subscription fees, would you go on to pay this forever? How significant will the cost be in 20 years from now when others presumably also start providing some sort of service.

On the other hand, if it is not expensive and only a fraction of the car price, then how are you going to achieve these growth levels with that data and technology to begin with. It is one thing to have a great technology, another to monetize it. They might license it for sure, but then you lose all that power right away. So the question then becomes, will it be a niche product or commodity at the end of the day - either of which will not allow you to have incredible returns.

What are your thoughts?",1234,0.93
2021-02-12 10:08:51,The incentive to short TSLA is just massive at this point,"Ok guys, let's throw away the year-old arguments about valuations and  modelling and how TSLA's price is 10-20x what it should be even not  accounting for all the competition that it might have in the future.

At this point the only key measure to look at here is **market cap:**  we are looking at a $768B company, almost $1T. In case you haven't noticed, there aren't a lot of companies thare are worth significantly    more than that. Only  AAPL, MSFT, AMZN and Saudi Aramco thare are worth  more than double the price of TSLA, and they are all cash cows with massive amounts of actual real profits and fat margins, something that  Elon Musk doesn't have.

Even if TSLA stock rallied heavilyin the next months, it could as well double and go into the same league as those blue chips, but **REALISTICALLY,  it's not a 10 bagger potential ANYMORE: do you actually believe that  there would be LITERALLY TRILLIONS of dollars flowing into this stock?** Because to increase its price we need those numbers at this point.

Really  think about the people that could buy TSLA at this point, basically  everybody knows it's a massive bubble, and it's much easier to justify  taking  that massive risk if you know you could be in for a multibagger  upside wise, but  it's not easy given the relatively small upside of  today.

Having said all that,  there needs to be a catalyst. In the next few years, as competiton in  EV and autonomus driving space starts to thicken, we  might  finally see  a meltdown ...

**What do you guys think about this?**  I might be wrong and many hedge fund legends  have  lost billions  shorting this stuff, but at this point the poop smell is just too much.  Burry shorted this a couple of months back, he  predicted  2008, he  predicted Game Stop, he might be right on this  too.

The  other interesting point is that if TSLA falls, it might take  down the  entire market with it, or at least a good portion of the  NASDAQ",34,0.74

Ark Invest's Cathie Wood isn't betting on Uber Technologies Inc UBER, -1.55% and LYFT Inc LYFT, -2.42% over Tesla Inc TSLA, +2.44%.

What Happened: Wood, CEO of New York-based Ark Invest, said in a tweet Saturday night that Uber and Lyft missed out on a data opportunity that ties in to AI — and which companies will most benefit from it.

Wood said the ride-sharing companies ""stayed private too long and lost the plot. They could have incentivized their drivers to put sensors on their cars and collect data much faster than even $TSLA.""

The tweet was in response to a question about Ark Invest's portfolio.

Data collection and AI are closely intertwined because machine learning systems develop faster and with greater precision when they are paired with large data sets.

Why It Matters: Wood's opinion carries weight. She has become the breakout star of the 2020 bull market as her actively-managed ETFs generate phenomenal returns. Shares of her ARK Innovation ETF ARKK, -1.43% are up over 163% this year.

2020-11-30 04:10:56,TSLA: Get ready to cash out from the largest ongoing pump and dump in history,"Ok, so TSLA will be included in S&P 500 in Dec 21. Old news. Around $100B(almost 1/5th of its market cap) of TSLA would need to be purchased(some active funds may have already purchased) based on current stock price.

The only reason I have been holding TSLA after it split is the whole S&P 500 inclusion thingy. After that, I don't know what will even move this stock. They freakin surpassed Berkshire and could surpass Facebook(for a short time)!!!

Today they will announce whether to include TSLA in two sessions or in one session.

[This is what happened when Yahoo was included(which is comparable to TSLA's inclusion as they have had relatively comparable size in comparison to S&P 500's size). Although I believe TSLA will rise again after some time, unlike Yahoo.](https://imgur.com/a/1qj22eR)

After the trading sessions, expect a big dip. As a lot of speculators this year have bought into TSLA precisely to front-run the index investors.

Also, the trade date Dec. 18, coincides with a once-quarterly event known as quadruple witching, the Friday near the end of each calendar quarter on which options and futures on both indexes and stocks expire simultaneously. Volume is usually heavy on those days and would help boost liquidity on the day of Tesla’s inclusion, investors said. (this paragraph copied straight from wsj)

So, I guess don't be a fool(unless there are some tax implications, which I don't have); buy the rumour, sell the news. TSLA will completely tank after the inclusion.

Also, remember NIO etc kind of benefit from the TSLA hype, so be very careful you all about them.

I don't think if you don't have any immediate tax implications, there wouldn't be much value holding TSLA for the longer term as there are better long term plays. And when or if TSLA reaches $700 or higher(I know I am very bullish, but that's why I am still holding it) there would be almost no point in holding it any longer.

Some special points to remember:

* TSLA already jumped 40% after its inclusion news broke out and had been steadily climbing before it due to rumour that it will be included in the index and Softbank's trade earlier this year.
* TSLA can issue more shares, especially in this valuation. I mean why wouldn't they, lol.

I know posts that say anything negative about TSLA gets downvoted but be careful about your TSLA shares or options!

Disclaimer: I am long TSLA shares and call options. I am also long PLTR(long leaps too) and some other meme stocks which I am not mentioning cause my post gets removed somehow and I am not sure why(so you know I don't give a damn about valuations, although I am kind of an early mover, so all of them are at a very profitable position).",2130,0.82

2020-12-31 14:12:10,Why the $TSLA bubble will not burst?,"A correction (\~-20%) can happen, but the bubble will not burst (where $TSLA loses more than 50%-90% of its value). Here's why:  

So a lot of people often use the dotcom bubble as a parallel to speculate the pop of the Tesla bubble. The most immediate comparisons come from names such as Amazon, which lost nearly 90% of its value from the peak of the bubble but was eventually able to gain back most of its shares. Other comparisons also include stocks such as Yahoo, which was actually added to the S&P 500 in 1999, right before the bubble burst, or even Qualcomm/Cisco. 

These speculations and comparisons are always interesting to think about. They come from deductions, aka where you extrapolate data points from the past in order to predict what is going to happen in the future. However, a deduction is often not the most useful mental model, especially when circumstances are different in the future. And this is one of those cases where the circumstances are actually very different. 

Now the basic argument of ""Tesla is not a car company"" is often overused. Yes, Tesla creates batteries, they are going into the autonomous market soon, their AutoPilot is one of the best AI that the world has today (stronger than NVIDIA's GPUs), they are going to get into the insurance game, they are going to get into the financing industry, some people might even say they are going to collaborate with Space X to create flying cars in 2050. That's all great. However, I'm actually going to argue that despite all of these things, Tesla's current price is overvalued but yet, the stock will not burst. And this has in large part to do with how the markets and trader psychology works today, and how different it is from 1999/2000:

As information and financial data has become more widely available through the internet, the markets have had a tendency to price things way ahead of it's time. For example, Tesla believers (bloggers/Youtubers/communities) can now share their bull case for Tesla and what the company will do years and years down the line. While CEOs and company personnel are not allowed to share such projections due to SEC rules, there is nothing stopping these communities from doing so. The most prominent of this has perhaps been Cathie Wood's ARK Invest. She laid out the case for Tesla way back in 2017, and as some of her projections (such as Tesla's profitability) have proven to be correct, people have now become believers that her entire bull case (of Tesla owning the entire autonomous space) will eventually be correct. In a way, the market has become this binary mechanism. FOMO kicks in due to the widespread information that is available, and people pile in. Now, most Tesla bulls believe in the $7000 PT (pre-split) that Cathie Wood has put on this stock, and I doubt very many people are going to be willing to sell before that price. In 1999, if a hedge fund manager was very bullish on a stock, most other investors had no way of knowing. There has been trend towards open-sourcing investing ideas from many investors, and this is a massive deal with Tesla. Other examples of this include Rob Baron or Chamath, who are also very famous investors and well-known Tesla bulls. 20 years ago, investing ideas were supposed to be secretive, with retail investors very much out of the know and speculating on their own. This is no longer the case today. 

In a way, we now live in an investing world of stories, where the story of a stock matters more than the numbers, and these stories get reverberated through social media communities. What a company will do 20 years down the line is a story that is just now more widely available. So even if Tesla stock drops by 10-15% tomorrow, I believe that there are enough believers in this story where they will just continue to buy up the stock from those prices. ""Buy the dip"" has become this sort of motto in many of these investing communities, and this same theory is true for any of these companies that seem to be outlandishly valued as Tesla. 

The bottom line is: As long as the story stays, the bubble of Tesla will not pop. Even if Tesla has a bad quarter but their long term outlook stays the same, I very much think this will stand true. The only way this bubble pops is if the story changes somehow. That can either be from investors such as ARK saying they no longer believe in the long term hypothesis or other events such as the death of Elon Musk. Otherwise, Tesla will very much continue to stand strong.",17,0.58

2020-12-18 07:57:23,$TSLA - Who is buying Tesla at these prices ?,"Robinhood's entire AUM is $20 billion according to Google. It is likely quite a bit more now. However it is tiny compared to something like Schwab with 5T. 

So this got me wondering who is buying Tesla shares. There is no way Robinhooders have enough money to move the market so much. If you go to [https://whalewisdom.com/stock/tsla](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/tsla) and sort by shares held. The only person in the entire first page buying Tesla is [SUSQUEHANNA SECURITIES, LLC](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/susquehanna-securities).

Susquehanna is the TSLA option maker. They are market neutral and likely bought shares to hedge for the explosion in Tesla option trading. My guess of what is happening is that, when someone buys Tesla options - say 750 strike for $1000 - they have notional exposure to 75000 for 1000 - 75x leverage !  So it's the options buying that are moving the TSLA stock.

There is this old video of Charlie Munger on dangers of options trading [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaGa\_HaP3gA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaGa_HaP3gA). Options volume was never this large, for example Google's total option market volume is 1/5th of Tesla, even though its a 2x bigger firm. This reminds me of the oil bust in mid march where you had financial speculators who had no interested in taking delivery, same I think happens in Tesla where people just get options with no intention of taking delivery.

Will be very interesting to see how much longer this elevated options trading continues as when the music stops, that 36billion+ of stock that Susquehanna holds will hit the market.",30,0.78

Well, it is difficult to explain why to every person individually and this new video from Ben Felix explains the reason why expertly.

https://youtu.be/foqswJT3Spc

The conclusion the video comes to is that you should just stick to low cost index funds (preferably globally diversified) rather than investing into large cap growth or trying to find the next Apple or Amazon.

**EDIT:** The definition of a ""growth"" company (as literally explained in the video) is a company that is ""expensive"" relative to the market. Expensive how? Well, relative to some fundamental ratio like P/B or P/E. Considering all the companies I have listed in my title have relatively high P/E and P/B ratios, you can say they are expensive. This makes them by definition a growth company. This isn't that hard to understand. If I said they are tech companies, no one would argue because they literally are tech companies. Well, just as much as they are tech companies, they are growth companies. They might not all be as expensive as each other, but relative to the market, they are expensive.

I am not commenting about how all these companies are as overbought as each other, or they are the same in every metric, I just listed some large-cap growth companies based on the definition of growth being expensive.",964,0.91
2020-12-21 04:10:51,Comparing YHOO AND TSLA,"Hi all

So now that TSLA is in the S&P let’s compare 

YHOO(1999) was part of the dotcom bubble, a bubble fuelled by the (in hindsight) mostly accurate assumptions that (a) cost of internet is going down (b) user count is going up (c) margins for profit are extremely good (d) economy of scale on the net is infinite. This lead to the assumption that YHOO and its ilk could potentially have a user base of [the world] and hence reap profits from 7bn users for essentially no cost of revenue. (900 PE valuation)

TSLA(2020) is part of the EV/disruptive tech bubble, a bubble fuelled by the speculation that growth of these disruptive industries can in some unspecified way achieve global dominance over existing market leader under the changing climate of (e)environmental policy, (f)government attitudes, and (g)exponential technical development. Unfortunately unlike YHOO it has a high base cost of revenue (manufacturing, research, retooling) and may run into the diseconomies of scale barrier that stymied the growth of many other physical goods companies due to a inherently high retail value of goods sold being a barrier to entry for new users. Arguably its one standout feature is (h)vertical integration something that has historically been successful during the early 1900s seen most prominently in the Trust monopolies (1300PE)

While YHOO and it’s Ilk fell precipitously other new companies that survived the tech bubble collapse (GOOGL, AMZN, FB, MSFT, AAPL, BABA) actually achieved the stated goal of (a-d) and became the largest market leaders seen since The AT&T and early 19th century Trust monopolies.

Are we looking at the next wave of companies coming into existence meeting the e-h criteria that will take over the world? Or is TSLA another canary set to die in the coal mine without any impact.

Discuss!

2020-09-23 07:17:58,$TSLA - summary of analyst thoughts following Battery Day,"**BULLS:**

**Oppenheimer: ""Doing More With Less.** TSLA outlined a robust reimagining of battery design, manufacturing, and performance including targeting a $25K vehicle in three years and 20x capacity increase by 2030. It is ramping a pilot line featuring a comprehensive redesign of product architecture, basic materials, and process technology and expects to yield \~56% cost declines, 54% range improvement, and 69% capex reduction, with initial benefits seen over 12–18 months, achieviing run-rate at \~three years. TSLA reiterated 30–40% delivery growth in 2020 (implied 478–515K) ahead of consensus estimates. We are impressed with the ambition of the endeavor and believe this roadmap charts ongoing technology and cost leadership for TSLA enabling sales into the entire LDV market. While limited details may weigh on shares, we would be buyers on any near-tearm weakness.""

**ON THE FENCE:**

**Morgan Stanley: ""A Call to Arms.** Tesla’s battery day largely lived up to the hype, but didn’t clearly exceed it. We think the main narrative is that Tesla’s battery tech is outpacing current growth in supply… and it's time to spend significantly.""

**Credit Suisse: ""Battery Day plan shows elevated growth narrative ahead, but consider challenges in manufacturing ramp.** Tesla’s much anticipated Battery Day brought several key positives: 1. Battery plans to support aggressive growth over next decade; 2. Growth unlocked via cost reductions on multiple fronts, highlighted by ambitious vertical integration plans; 3. Yet another reminder Tesla is well ahead of other automakers in the push to EV. However, the biggest driver of Tesla’s success in its strategy will be its ability to successfully ramp manufacturing, and we expect challenges along the way. Amid lofty expectations into the event, we see a ‘sell the news’ reaction on the stock given Tesla is still 3 years away from its planned $25,000 vehicle and full benefits from its battery strategy. That said, we ultimately expect weakness to be bought as the event highlighted Tesla’s robust growth narrative.""

**Canaccord Genuity: ""Battery Day hits on manufacturing strategies, but may disappoint for those that see a tech juggernaut.** As expected, Tesla’s Battery Day and shareholder meeting provided a trove of clues as to the direction of the company. For Bulls, the operational and systems approach to reduce manufacturing costs for autos and energy might be enough to warrant momentum. Bears, however, are likely to point the shift towards what looks increasingly like a modern day auto OEM than a tech company.""

**Goldman: ""Capacity, Battery Tech and Cost in focus.** Tesla believes that it will see the initial impact of these changes within 12-18 months, and the full impact in about 3 years. In addition, Tesla stated that it could release a $25,000 car in about 3 years as a result of the reduction in pack cost. We believe that a vehicle at this price point (coupled with Tesla's other products) would help Tesla to address a wide range of the light vehicle market (and furthermore EVs offer savings for the typical US driver in the form of lower maintenance and fuel costs that we have previously estimated are about $800 per year vs. an ICE vehicle). We expect the ability and timing for Tesla to fully achieve these targets to be one investor debate post the event, as Tesla has not always met its past targets. While we are incrementally positive on long-term EV adoption, we believe that the company's premium multiple (Exhibit 4 and Exhibit 5) currently reflects this.""

**BEARS:**

\*\*Barclays: ""\*\*while it had the usual set of aggressive forward-looking targets, the key question of the stock is whether a more subdued Musk – who uncharacteristically cautioned that the battery innovations were ‘close to working’ – is enough to sustain the valuation. We can see a few days of ‘sell the news,’ especially as Musk did not forecast either the 1 million mile battery (which many Tesla fans expected) or using Tesla cars for vehicle to gird (which we expected), and the ‘one more thing’ was delayed Model S Plaid performance variant. Moreover, the Plaid variant was delayed. After that, however, attention will shift to delivery forecasts for 3Q20, where Musk was silent other than forecasting 30-40% unit growth for 2020.""

**Needham: ""Will Vertical Integration Make or Break Tesla? We Have 3 Years to Find Out.** At its well-hyped Battery Day yesterday, TSLA announced its transformational plans to more than halve the cost per $/KWH of its batteries through the strategy of vertical integration. The ultimate goal is to increase range by 54%, while cutting cost/KWh by 56% and investment per GWh by 69% in five steps: cell design, cell factory, anode materials, cathode materials and cell vehicle integration (outlined below). This plan will take three years to be fully implemented. While we applaud the company's ambitious plans, we believe it is an inherently risky move with steep execution and operational challenges.""",747,0.93

""Tesla's Battery Day on 22 September was one of the industry's most anticipated events. Technical claims and cost ambitions (JEFe $50-60/Kwh) exceeded our expectations but raised key questions, from material availability to manufacturing processes. We turn to Professor Gerbrand Ceder from UC Berkeley for a critical analysis of the presentation, discussing among other topics: nickel availability, alternative chemistries and manufacturing challenges.""

Highlights from Q&A

""**Innovation** \- Many of the announced technical developments were anticipated and consistent with battery industry innovations but Tesla's strength remains in the drive to ""push boundaries"" and the time-scale for execution.""

""**Materials** \- Constraints on nickel supply may accelerate. Tesla battery capacity of 3 Twh by 2030 would require most of today's nickel production. Timeframe too short for material substitution. Lithium availability not an issue but extraction/refining over-simplified. Constrains can lead to vertical integration including capturing supplier margin. Solid state will eventually make silicon irrelevant.""

""**Chemistries** \- Doubts about the validity of LFP chemistry for automotive but more relevant for storage, where sodium-ion also looks relevant.""

""**Manufacturing** \- Cost roadmap looked ambitious considering manufacturing accounts for only 15-20% of total battery cost. Changes in manufacturing processes critical contributor to reduce investment spending. Tesla also acknowledged the challenge from pilot to production.""",596,0.93

Now, it sounds absolutely crazy when I say this, but the first thoughts that popped into my head when I was watching this live - as a non-engineer - if what Elon and his co-presenter are saying, they have a *massive* moat around them. That is, the engineering capabilities they demonstrated on stage were explained somewhat not terribly, but still made sense to me. With that said, what did you guys think?

Also, some questions for the electrical engineers/others who have experience in this field - how viable and how possible does this innovation seem to you? Is this revolutionary as Elon is saying?

For everyone else, does this make anyone else feel like they are undervaluing TSLA? I mean, it definitely put some doubt in me as to my current valuation. This morning, if you had asked me, I would’ve definitely said yes. After watching this, I am not so sure. I might even increase the value of the company.  Now, I am an Elon fan but I also know his tendency to not follow through with deadlines, yet still succeeding massively due to his ability to build things from ground up (his first-principles .

2020-09-17 08:19:56,"$TSLA - Morgan Stanley previews Battery Day with ""7 Mind Blowing Things"" they're expecting","Morgan Stanley:

""Ahead of Tesla's Battery Day on Sep 22nd, we publish some expectation 'benchmarks' for scale, efficiency, cost and technology that we believe may come to light. Based on our work with our Asia Tech team, we expect the event to be potentially narrative changing for Tesla and the battery market.""

""Elon Musk has promised 'mind blowing' battery tech to be unveiled during the highly anticipated September 22nd Battery Day. Our key expectation benchmarks to look out for:

1. **Capacity. We are prepared for Tesla to target Terawatt scale battery capacity plans.** Currently, we forecast Tesla to produce 439 GwH of batteries for their in-house production and 3rd party supply (combined) by 2030, accounting for just over a 26% share of the global EV battery market. Will Tesla target 1TwH by 2035? Or more/sooner?
2. **Battery manufacturing/production efficiency… 16-fold improvement?** With Maxwell, there would be theoretically a 16x production capacity increase by skipping the wet toxic chemicals to create the cathode, which then has to be dried and baked-off and needs a lot of floor space and ovens to meet that process.
3. **A doubling of energy density?** Battery density using the DBE system shows greater than 300 Wh/kg with a path to over 500 Wh/kg. By comparison, Tesla's most advanced (2170) battery today is around 247 Wh/kg. This implies potential to add 20% to its current highest density and could double it in the future. This could lead to vehicles with significantly more range – and could potentially push Tesla Model 3 to about 400 miles per charge with upside from there.
4. **Longevity… 1 million mile battery.** Battery life also shows improved durability with almost 2x improvement as Elon Musk recently stated ‘…the car battery pack is around 3-to-5,000 miles, but the newly designed pack that will go into production for next year is design\[ed\] explicitly for a million miles of operation with minimum maintenance...’. Extension of battery life has implications for cost of ownership, warranty, 2nd/3rd life battery use and buying time to allow the battery recycling infrastructure to catch up.
5. **Goodbye Cobalt?** Tesla has been spending a great deal of effort on researching new chemistries themselves to reduce and remove cobalt from the mix. Tesla’s battery research group led by Jeff Dahn in Halifax applied for a patent in November 2017 that describes a new battery cell chemistry that would result in faster charging and discharging, better longevity, and even lower cost. This has important ESG considerations as well.
6. **Battery $/KwH Targets:** The prevailing view is that battery cell cost can decline at a compound rate of 6 to 7% from just over a $100/KwH level today. Could Tesla communicate plans to potentially double this rate of deflation or to target $50/KwH or less by mid or latter this decade due to the additive/compounding effects of their process efficiencies, scale and energy density improvements? Additionally, we are looking out for an evolution in battery format that could be cylindrical with bigger diameter than the 2170\[0\]’s. Tesla is building a pilot production line to test mass production.
7. **An expectation that Tesla could emerge as a full-stack battery competitor...** Overall, the market appears to be leaning towards Tesla being a faster moving partner with scale that expands the market for all and investors are likely looking to reengage on existing battery makers post the battery day. Investors will likely also be looking closely at the state of collaboration with CATL. The million mile battery or cobalt-free battery is also a pipeline of CATL’s new technology. Tesla and CATL could potentially own the patents of those new technologies together and CATL would potentially be able to help industrialize new battery production.""",81,0.81

""As investors prepare for TSLA’s long anticipated Battery Day, we see four key areas of focus: anode and cathode material design, manufacturing process tech, leverage of the battery management system into powertrain optimization, and its path to solid state batteries, especially its electrolyte development approach. We're also expecting n evolution of TSLA’s main geometry for its cells showing wider diameters and not a move to prismatic cells. Last but not least, we expect an update on its relationships with cell partners like Panasonic and CATL. Given the scale of the opportunity in bothvehicle and stationary power, we expect TSLA to continue working closely with a few battery suppliers to scale production with key steps remaining in TSLA facilities.""

■ ""**Materials:** We believe TSLA has been experimenting and testing materials for well over a decade and that the organization's IP related to material behavior under the harsh conditions of a battery is a defensible advantage. We expect to hear the company discuss silicon and lithium doping, innovation from an electrolyte perspective, and potentially new composite materials that extend cell lifecycle and improve power density.""

■ ""**Process technology**: We believe the 2019 acquisition of Maxwell Technologies was a crucial enabler of TSLA’s roadmap. With increasing complexity of lattice structures for anodes and cathodes, the dry electrode process that Maxwell developed not only eliminates dryers and reduces production cycle times, it facilitates volume production of new composites. We expect meaningful detail on how TSLA will deploy the technology.""

■ ""**System architecture**: We believe TSLA leverages deep understanding of battery cycling and cooling patterns into optimal powertrain performance. We believe the integration of the battery management system with powertrain controls is a key area of differentiation for TSLA. We note TSLA has continued to work on 400V platforms and are watching for potential changes to underlying architecture, particularly related to its truck platforms.""

■ ""**Path to solid state**: With solid state competitors targeting solid state power density above 400W/kg, we'd expect TSLA to give its anticipated time for reaching such levels. We continue to believe one of the key bottlenecks in solid state development is the electrolyte material performance and will be looking for evidence of TSLA’s approach to that issue.""

■ ""**Scale up**: We expect TSLA to continue its approach to scaling capacity by working closely on cell design and process technology with its partners. We believe some of TSLA’s IP is highly sensitive which will lead to select process steps remaining within TSLA facilities even if partners help run the balance of the factory which we believe will help TSLA optimize capital spend.""",58,0.77

""We believe the significance of Battery Day is that it will showcase batteries as a pillar of Tesla’s growth strategy over the next two decades.""

""**Batteries as a pillar for growth – Master Plan Part 3**: We expect Battery Day to effectively be “Master Plan Part 3.” Tesla has talked to long-term battery capacity of 2 TWh – more than 30x its current capacity. This sharp increase supports growth in three areas: auto, stationary storage, and supply to others. Specifically in auto, battery growth underscores Tesla’s ambition of selling 20mn vehicles/yr, which would make it 2x the size of Toyota (the world’s largest automaker), and is 40x Tesla’s volume this year. While we see this as overly aggressive, we nevertheless foresee Tesla reaching 5mn units over time; market share gains of Japanese OEMs in the US in the 1980s/90s serves as a precedent.

""**Insourcing central to lower cost**: While Tesla will maintain partnerships with other cellmakers, the event is expected to highlight plans for Tesla to insource. Specifically, a robust battery manufacturing process is central to achieving scale and driving cost down.""

""**Battery cost reductions central to driving growth**: We expect Tesla to demonstrate it has multiple paths to reducing cost, both in the battery pack itself (potential target of \~$75/kWh), and outside the pack. Cost reduction is likely to be a key aspect of Tesla strategy, as it can help to unlock sales at lower pricepoints, and thus fuel further growth. Tesla’s approach in China serves as a case study for how lower cost can drive volume.

""**Battery technicals**: With significant aspirations on battery performance and energy density, it provides Tesla with another path to reducing cost.""

""**Supporting the stock price, raising TP**. Even if Tesla provides overly ambitious aspirations at Battery Day, we nevertheless expect the event to reinforce Tesla’s long-term growth narrative – central to the stock, while also reinforcing investor perception that Tesla is ahead of other automakers. We raise our '20 EPS to $3.33 from $2.55 and **TP to $400** from $280 – an energized growth narrative reinforces Tesla’s elevated stock price, and thus a wide cost-of-capital advantage. Risks: Increased competition, misexecution on growth, increased uptake of EVs.""",109,0.85

2021-02-26 12:59:34,JPMorgan advises clients to expose 1% of their portfolio to Bitcoin,"In a recent note to clients, strategists from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) suggested a one percent portfolio allocation to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

As reported by Bloomberg, JPM strategists Joyce Chang and Amy Ho opined that Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against fluctuations from traditional assets like bonds, stocks, and commodities. However, they advised clients to allocate a small percentage due to the risk of major downturns in Bitcoin’s value.

After setting a new all-time high above $58,000, the value of the digital asset slumped to less than $45,000 and has been struggling to recover ever since.

Chang and Ho told investors:

>*In a multi-asset portfolio, investors can likely add up to 1% of their allocation to cryptocurrencies in order to achieve any efficiency gain in the overall risk-adjusted returns of the portfolio.*

Bitcoin has welcomed major investments from the likes of Paul Tudor Jones, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and MicroStrategy. The endorsement from JPM comes at a time when institutional players are rushing to accumulate the digital asset. As per Bloomberg’s report, America’s oldest bank BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) has also announced plans to enable Bitcoin transactions for its clients.

The strategists were quick to add that cryptocurrencies should be viewed as an investment vehicle and opposed to being funding currencies like the USD or EUR. This appears to be contrary to earlier statements from other JPM analysts that called cryptocurrencies the “poorest hedge for major drawdowns in equities.”

Still, I've made a decent return in the past year and a half with a lot of that coming from SPY. Recently I sold my SPY positions and bought SPXL (a 3x leveraged fund benchmarked to the S&P 500). I'm aware of [some of the risks associated with a leveraged fund](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/121515/why-3x-etfs-are-riskier-you-think.asp) compared to one like SPY, but given the bull market I haven't had to worry much about them. I don't know exactly what it will look like over the volatility from Tesla being added to the S&P 500.

One of my specific questions is that I know that volatility over a period of days can negatively impact the fund but I am less certain of what would happen during intra-day volatility. If there are large swings throughout the day but the S&P closes at the exact same price it opened with, would SPXL do the same?

Obviously I have some risk tolerance for holding SPXL in the first place, but in your opinions is the uncertainty of the next few days enough for you to recommend a more conservative approach like switching back to SPY?",7,0.67

2021-03-15 06:23:14,Ford ($F) - Ugly Duckling to Golden Goose,"# Overview

For much of its’ history, Ford ($F) has been a boring dividend stock, yielding between 5% and 10% per year and generally languishing between $5 and $15 a share. Not exactly an inspiring story of growth or innovation. In a sector that hosts charismatic CEOs, exciting newcomers, and glossy new entrants to the industry, selling people on Ford’s potential certainly seems like an uphill battle. I mean… just look at their all-time chart, Ford hasn’t had meaningful sustained price movement since 00-01, and that was in the wrong direction.

I would like you to forget what you think you know about Ford and begin to look at them in a new light. Ford is no longer the ugly girl at the dance or the fat kid in gym class, but rather Ryan Reynolds in *Just Friends* or Laney Boggs in *She’s All That*. To understand why I think Ford is the most compelling value opportunity in the auto sector today, we’re going to have to look at its maneuverings over the last 3-4 years.

# New Leadership, New Vision

**$11B Restructuring Plan**

In October of 2020, Ford hired its’ new [CEO Jim Farley](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/people/james-d--farley--jr-.html) who had previously held the title of COO within the company. Farley was the architect behind the company’s [$11B restructuring plan](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/11/26/ford-statement-on-business-transformation.html) that it announced in June of 2018, and it has only accelerated its’ pace under his guidance. By most estimates Ford is about halfway through its plan to restructure the company, which primarily involves cuts to unprofitable sectors and refocusing on profitable ones, as well as investment in future technologies.

**Trimming of Fat**

Ford has made a few major moves to shore up losses it was incurring in unprofitable arms of the business. The first, and one which you are probably already aware of, is the discontinuation of many of its sedan lineup in North America. In the middle of 2018, Ford announced that it would be [eliminating the Taurus, Fiesta, Fusion, C-Max, and Focus sedans](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2018/04/25/ford-cutting-car-lineup-earnings/34244867/) from their lineup moving forward. The estimated operating cost savings was $25.5B through 2022, and Ford announced that they would be focusing on their more profitable SUV and pick-up models moving forward.

Ford also announced in 2021 that it would be largely [exiting the South American market](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/01/11/ford-advances-south-america-restructuring.html), which hadn’t turned a profit since 2012 and in fact accounted for over $5B in losses during that period. They would continue operating at small-scale producing their popular Ranger pick-up and commercial vans but with the closure of their main manufacturing facility in Brazil, Ford finally cut bait in a difficult market for most traditional automakers.

Ford Europe had a [major redesign](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2019/06/27/ford-looks-to-the-future-in-europe--business-redesigned-for-prof.html) under Farley when he was President of Global Markets, slashing underperforming models from its lineup and refocusing on its highly profitable commercial vehicles as well as increasing imports of its iconic models. They also announced a [strong shift toward EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2021/02/17/ford-europe-goes-all-in-on-evs-on-road-to-sustainable-profitabil.html) with the goal of selling only electric vehicles in Europe by 2030.

**EV Investment**

Here is the section everyone is interested in, and one which GM rightly received a lot of hype for when they announced a [plan to spend $27B on developing EVs](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/gm-accelerating-ev-plans-with-additional-7-billion-announces-new-pickup.html) and autonomous vehicles by 2025. After that announcement, GM was viewed by many as the front-runner for EVs among traditional automakers. Not to be outdone, Ford announced a [$29B investment in EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/04/ford-raises-planned-investment-ev-av-leadership.html) and autonomous vehicles to be spent by 2025. To date, that is the third largest investment in EVs in the world, only falling short of the $86B and $87B investments by the mega-conglomerates VW and HMG respectively.

**Revival of Valuable IP**

In the last few years, Ford has refocused much of their business on their greatest hits. They’ve cut unpopular IP from their lineup and re-released the Bronco as well as reworked the Mustang into a crossover EV. In my opinion, this demonstrates a greater understanding of their markets and how to capitalize on their most valuable asset, which is their IP. Their most profitable model, the F-150, will be released as an EV in 2022 or 2023, and I expect that the Bronco will also see an EV model in the next few years as well. I believe that Ford has become a leaner and more focused company within the last 3 years and is set to continue their dominance in pick-ups as well as siphon significant market share in the EV and SUV spaces.

# The Power of Partnerships

**Ford, VW, and Argo**

Ford, along with fellow automotive titan Volkswagen Group, have both taken [large stakes](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2020/06/02/volkswagen-investment-argo-ai-ford-self-driving.html) in a company dedicated to autonomous driving software called Argo AI. Partnering with a company with considerable resources like VW takes some of the pressure off of Ford to develop this technology solo. While there haven’t been too many details released about this partnership or the progress being made by Argo AI, it is reassuring to know that Ford is actively invested in developing autonomous driving along with another industry leader in VW.

**Ford and Google**

In February of 2021, Ford and Google announced a [partnership](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html) to place Google’s software and technology in all of Ford’s new vehicles beginning in 2023. The operating platform in these new vehicles will be based off of the Android platform and all new vehicles will come equipped with Alphabet products like Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Assistant, and the Play Store. The addition of a familiar and established operating system like Android will give Ford vehicles a competitive edge over other automakers who try to create and implement their own subpar operating software (\*cough\* Toyota \*cough\*).

**Ford and Rivian**

Ford made headlines in April 2019 when they invested in Rivian for an undisclosed stake. What is clear from statements made by both CEO’s at the time is that the investment was both for equity as well as a strategic partnership. A planned vehicle by Ford, which has yet to be announced, will be built on Rivian’s unique [“skateboard”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2019/04/24/ford-jumps-on-rivians-skateboard/?sh=215fbc2d23ef) platform. This platform consists of “a flat frame that contains the batteries, suspension, motors and braking” on which the cab rests, and theoretically cuts costs in the manufacturing of EVs due to fewer overall parts in assembly. I suspect that this may be the platform used in the inevitable Bronco EV release, due to the striking similarities in the size and styling of the Bronco and the Rivian R1S. It is also possible that Ford may release an entirely new model on the platform, but that is just my hunch.

The equity stake in Rivian was undisclosed, but I expect that that stake may be worth [between $2B and $5B](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/23/rivian-scores-1point3-billion-investment-from-trowe-price-others.html) based on the valuation of Rivian at time of investment (\~$5B-7B) and now (\~$30B-$50B). This equity stake and strategic partnership will serve Ford well in their future development in the EV market.

# Financials and Valuation

**Financial Overview**

2020 was a tough year for many industries and the auto sector was no exception. Ford had 4 consecutive quarters of negative EPS, their YOY revenue fell by almost 20% when compared to 2019, and they had to eliminate their dividend in March 2020 for the first time since 2009 when it was eliminated during the Great Recession, before being reinstated in 2012. So where does this leave Ford now?

Despite the blow to revenue in 2020, Ford is emerging leaner and better equipped to dominate the market in 2021 and beyond. Revenue decreased 20% in 2020, and Ford had to take on significant new debt to continue financing operations. However that appears to be true for most other major automakers during the pandemic, so I don’t expect this to be a major factor in determining which automakers will be most successful in the future. I expect that 2021 will be a blockbuster year for Ford as revenues increase to pre-pandemic levels (I expect higher earnings in Q3 and Q4), and they continue to develop the most profitable arms of their business.

**Dividend Reinstatement**

GM and Ford both eliminated their dividends to survive the pandemic in March 2020, however there is widespread expectation that they will reinstate them sometime this year as revenue begins to pick back up. I personally view this as an incentive to buy Ford before the announcement. If they reinstate their .60 yearly dividend, it would amount to a \~5% annual yield based on the current stock price of 13.37. I expect that the return of their dividend will also attract the return of investors who value dividend stocks which may push the price up further all on its own. I believe this is a mini-catalyst for short term price movement for Ford, and collecting on the dividend won’t hurt either.

**Comparison to Other Traditional Automakers**

Generally, I like to look at 4 different ratios to quickly judge the valuation of a company compared to their peers in the same industry. Lets compare Ford’s numbers to their closest 5 competitors (Toyota, Honda, VW, GM, Daimler) to get a sense of how fairly they are currently valued. I’m avoiding comparing Ford to newcomers like TSLA, NIO, etc. because frankly the numbers aren’t comparable. Financial data was gathered from Finviz and Yahoo Finance.

Quick definitions of the ratios, with respect to current valuation:

P/S = Share price/Sales per Share (Lower is better)

Forward P/E = Share price/(Estimated net profit for next year/# of outstanding shares) (Lower is better)

Debt-to-Equity = Total debt/shareholder equity (Lower is better)

Current Ratio = Current assets/Current liabilities over the next year (Higher is better)

Price to Book = Share price/Book value per share (Lower is better)

|**Ratio**|**Ford**|**Toyota**|**Honda**|**VW**|**GM**|**Daimler**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/S|0.39|0.99|0.45|0.53|0.66|0.50|
|Forward PE|8.64|12.92|9.24|10.67|9.49|8.87|
|Debt/Equity|5.27|1.10|0.97|1.71|2.44|2.60|
|Current Ratio|1.20|1.10|1.30|1.12|1.00|1.15|
|P/B|1.73|1.05|0.67|0.80|1.89|1.27|

&#x200B;

As you can see, Ford has noticeable strengths and weaknesses when it comes to valuation. Strictly looking at revenue metrics like P/S and P/E, Ford is the most undervalued company on this list. They do however carry the largest debt burden of all of the listed companies, so that is something to keep in mind. I’m not particularly worried about their debt situation, as their Current Ratio at 1.20 indicates that they are in no present danger of being crushed by their debt, and I expect that strong future revenue will allow them to dig themselves out of that hole.

Compared to GM, who I believe to be their closest competitor, they are trading at a much lower revenue multiple (0.39 vs 0.66). Even accounting for Ford’s higher debt burden, I believe they should be trading closer to a 0.50 multiple, which puts them more in line with other traditional automakers.

My personal price target: **$17.14/share**

# 2021 Outlook

**Massive Demand**

Ford’s most recent releases the 2021 F-150, the 2021 Bronco Sport, and the 2021 Mustang Mach-E are all flying off dealer’s lots at [record pace](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/05/demand-looks-very-high-for-fords-tesla-fighting-mu/). The auto industry quantifies demand with a specific metric called Time to Turn. This is a measure of how long a vehicle sits on the lot before it is purchased. The industry average Time to Turn is somewhere [around 60 or 70 days](https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/auto-industry/new-vehicle-inventory-swells-in-february.html) for new vehicles. Anything under 20 days generally indicates that a specific model is in very high demand. I’ll list the Time to Turn for Ford’s three new models in 2021 below:

2021 Ford F-150: 9 days

2021 Bronco Sport: 13 days

2021 Mustang Mach-E: 4 days (!!!)

As you can see Ford’s recent releases have been massive successes so far, and I expect that as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic that demand will only continue to rise for these models.

**7500 tax credit availability**

Remember that $7500 federal tax credit that everyone was all excited about when EVs first went to market in the U.S.? Me neither. The reason you may not have heard about this tax credit in awhile is probably due to the fact that the biggest seller of EVs (Tesla) is [no longer eligible](https://www.cars.com/articles/tesla-tax-credit-is-expiring-heres-everything-shoppers-need-to-know-1420700959540/) to receive the credit for purchases of their vehicles. The second biggest seller (GM) is about to lose eligibility at the end of this month.

The way this program works is that an auto manufacturer is eligible for the credit for their first 200,000 vehicles sold in the U.S. After that, they are only eligible for state-level tax credits which tend to be much smaller if they exist at all. To date, Ford has only sold a measly 10,000 EVs total in the U.S with around 5,000 of their largely unsuccessful Focus EV and 5,000 of their new 2021 Mach-E. That means they have an enormous 190,000 vehicles left for which their purchasers can be incentivized by the tax credit. In my opinion this gives Ford a massive advantage over their closest competitors (GM and Tesla), and in fact, we are already seeing Ford stealing market share directly from Tesla as it appears that [nearly 100% of Tesla’s recent loss in market share is attributable to Ford](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/04/business/ford-mustang-mach-e-tesla-market-share/index.html).

Bear Case

**Chip Shortage**

As I’m sure you’ve heard by now, semiconductor shortages are projected to be a [massive problem](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/01/semiconductor-shortage-halts-auto-factories/) for the auto industry as a whole. Recent estimates put nearly[1 million](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3662459-auto-chip-shortage-could-impact-1-million-vehicles-in-q1) new vehicles affected by the shortage in Q1 2021 alone across the entire auto sector. Ford has already had to cut shifts at some of their manufacturing plants because they cannot secure enough chips to produce as many vehicles as they’d like. A few automakers like Toyota and Hyundai had the foresight to maintain their semiconductor supply, and thus their 2021 production will not be affected. The chip shortage will surely cut Ford’s top-line revenue, and it is not expected to ease until late 2021 at the earliest.

**Battery Supplier Issues**

In February 2021, the U.S. International Trade Commission [ruled against battery supplier SK Innovation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-sk-innovation-ford/u-s-itc-criticizes-ford-for-pursuing-sk-innovation-battery-deals-idUSKBN2AX00Z) in their patent battle with competitor LG Chem. SK Innovation is the contracted supplier for batteries for the planned F-150 EV. This caused reasonable consternation among investors who were worried that the F-150 production timeline could be affected. Buried in the ruling however, was a stipulation that SK Innovation could continue to supply Ford with batteries for the F-150 through 2025, which should give Ford time to shift to a new supplier. There is always a chance that the Biden administration overrules the ITC in favor of securing greater production capability for the U.S. Nevertheless, this represents a hurdle that Ford will have to address in the future.

**Debt Burden**

There’s no way to sugar coat it, Ford has a ton of debt. They were a relatively debt heavy company prior to the pandemic, and that has only become worse. If you look at the company comparisons done above you can see the relatively high debt-to-equity ratio that ford carries compared to other automakers. The good news is that much of that debt isn’t due in the near future and Ford’s outlook is due to improve significantly from the disaster that was 2020.

**New Competition (Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, Etc.)**

This post has already become obscenely long so I’m not going to go into great detail here. You’ve all heard of these companies and how they intend to disrupt the auto sector, costing traditional automakers market share. There is no doubt that there are more players on the field these days, and Ford and GM will not have a virtual monopoly on the American market anymore. I personally only have high hopes for a few of the newcomers, but they still represent one more obstacle on Ford’s path to success.

**Closing**

I believe that Ford is currently undervalued and is ready to succeed as a leader in EVs in the future. This does not mean that investing in Ford is a sure thing; parts shortages, a high debt burden, and emerging competition all represent serious threats to Ford’s core business. Nonetheless, I am confident in Ford’s future prospects and consider them to be a strong buy as a long-term investment.

All these posts always seem to ignore valuation and they rarely make an effort to justify the valuations of the companies they preach. It’s easy so say that a company will grow sales 25% year over year for the next decade, but if the company trades a 100x P/S then what good is it? The market has already priced in the high growth of these companies. You cannot make money betting on something already priced in. In order to think the stock is a good investment, you have to expect it to grow more than what the market currently expects. A lot of people don’t seem to make that connection. They just say “company do good = stock go up.” I have no doubt that all these hyper growth stocks like TSLA will be much larger in 10 years than they are today. That doesn’t make it a good investment because the market is already expecting absurdly high growth and so that is factored into the stock price. Many companies grew substantially over a certain period of time despite their stock suffering. An easy example is Microsoft in 1999. Was Microsoft a better company in 2009 than in 1999? Microsoft had revenue that was 3x higher in 2009 than in 1999. Despite this, the stock was down over 50% during that timeframe.

# Overview

""Proterra is a high-growth commercial electric vehicle technology leader with over a decade of production experience. The Company has designed an end-to-end, flexible technology platform that delivers world-class performance and a low total cost of ownership to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and end customers. Proterra has three complementary businesses:

* **Proterra Powered**: Delivering industry-leading battery systems and electrification solutions to commercial vehicle manufacturers;
* **Proterra Transit:** Leading North America as the market’s #1 electric transit bus OEM; and
* **Proterra Energy:** Offering end-to-end turnkey charging and energy management solutions.

The Company’s industry-leading battery systems have been proven in more than 16 million service miles driven by its fleet of transit vehicles and validated through partnerships with world-class commercial vehicle OEMs, such as Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation (FCCC), Thomas Built Buses, Van Hool, Bustech, and Optimal-EV. To date, Proterra has produced and delivered more than 300 megawatt-hours of battery systems, more than 550 heavy-duty electric transit buses and installed 54 megawatts of charging systems.

Proterra operates manufacturing facilities in California and South Carolina, as well as a state-of-the-art R&D lab in Silicon Valley. The Company recently announced the opening of a new battery production line co-located in its electric transit bus manufacturing facility in Los Angeles County. This battery production line was established within a year and demonstrates Proterra’s ability to bring its scalable and capital-efficient battery manufacturing process directly to commercial vehicle OEMs alongside their existing manufacturing.""

Proterra is going public via a SPAC merger ticker **ACTC.** A [press statement](https://www.proterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Proterra-Release.pdf) released on January 12th, 2021 suggests that the merger is ""expected to close in the first half of 2021"". There is some speculation regarding the date; they’ve already filed the S-4, so the timeline for merger vote looks to be around end of March to April first week according to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/le6yur/proterra_actc_merger/) and [the SEC website.](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=1820630&owner=exclude)

* [Form 8-K](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-006284/)

# Financials and Fundamentals

**All data derived from SEC forms and the** [investor presentation.](https://www.proterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ACTC-Proterra-Investor-Presentation.pdf)

* **2025E EBITDA:** 21%
* **2025E Free Cash Flow:** $390MM
* **'20E-'25E CAGR:** 68% (Peer median 37%)
* **'22E-'25E Scaling Gross Margins:** 13-25% (Peer median 23%)
* **'21E Valuation:** 6.5x (Peer median 16.2x)
* **'22E Valuation:** 3.6x (Peer median 10.3x)
* These are very attractive valuations considering the growth compared to peers.
* **Trading Median (as of January 2021):** 1.6 transaction value/trading value (Trading median 3.1)
* **Revenue '21E:** $246MM (Peer median $120MM)
* **Implied Enterprise Value of Publicly Traded Mobility Tech Leaders:** $4.7Bn
* **Implied Enterprise Value of Publicly Mobility SPAC Transactions:** $4.3Bn
* **Implied Enterprise Value of Proterra:** $1.6Bn

**Let's do a little evaluating ourselves:**

**Shares outstanding post-merger:** 240.1MM

**Based on January ACTC prices pre NASDAQ sell-off:** $24/share

* 240.1MM \* $24/share = 5.76Bn Market Cap
* Let's find Proterra's value here without the SPAC shenanigans.
* 5.76Bn - $852MM = 4.91Bn Market Cap without SPAC cash
* 2022E estimated revenue is 439M
* 2022E adjusted .7561 for present value is 332M
* So unadjusted EV/Rev = 11.18
* And adjusted EV/Rev = 14.78
* Competitor EV/Rev = 10.3x on average for 2022E
* Proterra claims an 84% premium
* 1.84 \* 10.3 = 18.95
* So the industry metric is 18.95x.

**UNADJUSTED:**

* 439 unadjusted x 18.9 = 8.3B
* Add the cash from the SPAC: $852mm
* $9.162Bn unadjusted market cap
* 9.162/240.1 = **$38.16 unadjusted**
* 9.162Bn - 5.76Bn = **3.402Bn undervalued**

**ADJUSTED:**

* 332 \* 18.9 = 6.274Bn
* Add the cash from the SPAC: $852mm
* $7.126Bn adjusted market cap
* 7.126/240.1 = **$29.58 adjusted**
* 7.126 - 5.76 = **$1.366Bn undervalued**

**Average between adjusted and unadjusted:**

* Dollar value: $2.384Bn undervalued
* **Fair share price: $33.87**

[Here is another analyst finding it undervalued in a similar way on Feb 10th.](https://investorplace.com/2021/02/actc-stock-arclight-spac-merger-proterra-undervalued/)

*Let's think about that for a moment...*

As of this writing ACTC is trading at $15.65, based on purely fundamentals without speculation it is trading **116.42% below it's actual value.**

# Conclusion

Proterra is not only the most undervalued stock on the entire market, it's also positioned to be one of the best performing companies over the next several years. With an incredible first-mover advantage (16mm driven/10 years production) and a massive lead on the market (50%+ US market share), there is nothing stopping this stock from absolutely exploding post-merger which is expected to happen end of March-first week in April (although the official statement is ""the first half of this year""). 

The company is currently undervalued by 116.42% on fundamentals alone, and that's on the ""fair"" end. When people realize what is actually happening here and what this is about to become, I think the hype and excitement has the potential to drive these prices much higher. I see a TSLA situation brewing. No not because it's just another EV company, because it's an established, well-connected, constantly growing *commercial* EV company.

**Bear Case:** I literally can't think of one aside from the merger falling apart. If someone could provide a bear case in the comments for Proterra (assuming the merger is successful) I would love to discuss it, because either I'm missing something glaringly obvious or this might be my greatest pick.

**How to Play?**

I am long on this with my shares. I will be holding all my shares for several years, my calls I will exercise half after the merger and sell the rest for a nice profit. If you want to just play the merger that's an option too. Meaning just hold until the merger date and sell at whatever you think the peak is that very day.

1. Buy shares, ACTC will change to PTRA after the merger. Shares will be 1:1
2. Warrants, ACTCW, if you're not familiar how warrants work they are essentially call options with a fixed strike price of $11.50
3. Calls, I think virtually anything listed is going to print (aside from 03/19)
4. Selling puts, the premiums are hefty so either you'll get a nice premium or you'll own some shares at a really nice discount.

**Positions:**

3,865 shares @ 22.37

10C 04/16 $20.00

12C 05/21 $22.50

17C 05/21 $25.00

6C 08/20 $35

**TL;DR:** Fundamental's alone show this company is already **116.42% undervalued**, factor in hype, forward-thinking, IPO, etc. and I can't even come up with a PT. I would *expect* a PT post-merger to travel upwards to \~$50-$60 and settle back down no lower than $34. EOY my prediction is \~$70-$80. 2025 prediction is \~$300-$500. I recommend you read. I wouldn't want to gloss this one over if I were you. If you prefer you could simply check out [their investor presentation.](https://www.proterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ACTC-Proterra-Investor-Presentation.pdf) 

**EDIT:** The 10.3 factor is from an EV basket that includes many direct and indirect competitors. The list is in the presentation. 

**EDIT 2:** This is a fundamental DD. There are a lot of comments regarding other competitors not mentioned. Most of the companies not mentioned were including in the 10.3 factor for diversity. A lot of these competitors being mentioned are bus manufacturers, Proterra is a fleet level ecosystem infrastructure provider. They don’t just make buses. 

**EDIT 3:** Fair warning, even though Proterra is significantly undervalued, there are other market mechanics at play. With the NASDAQ sell off its uncertain how much lower ACTC will go if at all. I think this is an excellent play, now you just need excellent timing.

**EDIT4:** Added “2025E” to EDIBTA

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, nothing I ever say or do is a financial recommendation. Any words urging someone to do something is only going as far as suggesting they do their own DD, it is in no way an attempt to convince anyone to make any financial decisions. Plus...this thing doesn't need to get pumped. I'm just trying to share the find.*",1259,0.88
2020-07-21 13:05:15,TSLA earnings tomorrow,"Thoughts on Tesla tomorrow. As usual, Tesla’s vehicle deliveries drive most of its earning results, since vehicle sales represent the automaker’s main revenue stream at the moment.

Tesla already released its Q2 2020 numbers confirming that it delivered 90,650 cars and produced ‘over 82,000 vehicle’ between April and June.

The automaker beat Wall Street expectations, which were low due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Deliveries were down roughly 5% versus the same period last year, but it was surprisingly good considering the broader auto industry took a significantly larger hit.",77,0.86

2021-03-07 16:09:01,ARKK (Innovation Fund) Top 5 Stock Picks - Week Ending 3/7/21,"Hey All, each Sunday, I plan to pick 5 stocks from ARK’s funds that are most attractive from a fundamental perspective (i.e. growth rates, margins, valuation). I'm doing this for myself so thought it'd be helpful to share with others before trading begins on Mondays.

Planning to do this for the Innovation (ARKK) fund today, then the autonomous tech next week, then next gen internet, then fintech before the whole cycle repeats. (Unless it turns out that there’s no interest in this, then I’ll stop posting).

**Why ARK?**

* Though ARK’s strategy can be seen as overhyped and controversial, what I do like about the fund is that they are growth-focused with an [internal annual hurdle rate of 15%](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/Marketing_Material/ARKInvest_122019_ESG-Policy.pdf) based on a 5-year time horizon
* But, I think ARK tends to be on the optimistic end of the spectrum and sometimes ***too*** **tolerant of overly stretched valuations**
* As a result, I’m hoping to give you the **best of both worlds: high growth stock picks at the most attractive prices,** all by using ARK’s ETF picks as a filter for vetted, high-growth companies 
   * To be clear, I’m not saying ARK’s picks are all bulletproof. Just using the fund’s picks since they have a much bigger research team and resources than an individual investor such as myself, so **think of this post as a potential** ***starting point*** **for more research**

**My Process & Selection Criteria**

* First of all, I’ll be excluding all non-tech stocks in my analysis because I personally like to focus on tech. Including healthcare stocks (which pretty much are what the non-tech stocks are) ruins the metric comparisons given the differences in industries.
* My process was pretty simple. Downloaded all the tickers from ARK, pulled data from wallmine or went through filings myself. As a result, there may be some slight discrepancies from the data you use and mine but they should be around the same ballpark.
* Next, my **selection criteria,** which will I’ll likely change over time each week. Today the ones I’m using include the following (data sourced from wallmine and filings):
   * **Trading at less than 70% of the 52 week high** \- provides context around market sentiment
   * **Greater than 25% LTM revenue growth** \- guide for the future
   * **Greater than 60% LTM gross margins** \- operational efficiency
   * **LTM cash flow positive** \- operational efficiency
   * **LTM Revenue multiple of less than 15x** \- valuation
* Given that the market is a bit bearish right now and punishing stocks with stretched valuations, I’m heavily weighting the valuation criteria as you’ll see soon

**The Top 5 Picks of the Week**

* **2U - a leading edtech company**
   * 52 week high discount: 41%
   * LTM revenue growth: 34%
   * LTM gross margins: 71%
   * LTM cash flow positive: 0%
   * EV / LTM revenue: 3.3x
   * Commentary: Most software companies are trading 20-30x with these types of fundamentals, so based on the valuation, 2U seems very promising
* **Baidu - a Chinese AI and internet conglomerate**
   * 52 week high discount: 26%
   * LTM revenue growth: 46%
   * LTM gross margins: 48%
   * LTM cash flow positive: 33%
   * EV / LTM revenue: 4.7x
   * Commentary: Really great financial figures and super low revenue multiple, but do keep in mind that there’s always heightened risk when investing in Chinese companies
* **PagerDuty - an incident response software company**
   * 52 week high discount: 36%
   * LTM revenue growth: 27%
   * LTM gross margins: 87%
   * LTM cash flow positive: (35%)
   * EV / LTM revenue: 13.1x
   * Commentary: The company is in its growing phase so that’s why I’m forgiving of its negative 35% free cash flow margin and a 13.1x revenue multiple seems very fair for this kind of financial profile for a software company. Keep in mind these are EV / LTM revenue multiples, so this multiple is even lower for NTM but I just don’t have that data.
* **Teradyne - a test equipment manufacturing company whose customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, and more**
   * 52 week high discount: 23%
   * LTM revenue growth: 34%
   * LTM gross margins: 57%
   * LTM cash flow positive: 29%
   * EV / LTM revenue: 5.8x
   * Commentary: Based on the growth rate, margins, and valuation, seems like a bargain
* **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company - primarily makes chips**
   * 52 week high discount: 15%
   * LTM revenue growth: 33%
   * LTM gross margins: 53%
   * LTM cash flow positive: 29%
   * EV / LTM revenue: 11.4x
   * Commentary: The company isn’t trading at much of a discount relative to the others at 85% but I chose this company because there has been some news I came across recently of a chip shortage, which means there is incredible demand for TSMC’s products

**Edit:** One thing I forgot to add - there's obviously a lot more to investing than just numbers. And it's very possible that the numbers I share each week has an important story behind it (i.e. an inflated revenue figure due to an acquisition rather than organic growth). So as I mentioned earlier in the post, please view this as a starting point of research and I'm not necessarily recommending all these as buys. Just that they are attractive from a financial perspective + it helps that the ARK team vetted the company.",450,0.91
2020-09-30 08:59:33,$TSLA - Credit Suisse says Q3 likely to meet rising expectations,"Credit Suisse:

""We expect Tesla 3Q20 deliveries of \~140k, vs. sell-side consensus 136k, and enough to clear likely buy-side consensus \~135-140k. While our expectation **would require a record month for Tesla in September (\~65k units)**, we believe this is feasible given Tesla’s typical quarter-end wave. We assume 3Q production \~135-140k. And while the bar has risen on the 3Q delivery release, we believe Tesla may have just enough to clear it.""

""Decomposing 3Q deliveries, **we assume June/July combined deliveries of \~75k**; for context, this is the highest first-two-months of a quarter for Tesla, ahead of the prior high of \~50k in Oct/Nov 2018, and also ahead of Oct/Nov 2019 of \~47k…**upside this quarter has primarily come from the US (in part aided by the ramp of Model Y) and also from China**. Assuming Jul/Aug of \~75k, our forecast assumes September deliveries of \~65k units, which would represent the highest-ever final month of a quarter for Tesla (prior high of 63k in Dec’19). While aggressive, we believe this is feasible given Tesla’s typical quarter-end wave.""

""**Gauging the bar on 3Q deliveries, has likely drifted higher to \~135-140k**. We’d argue the bar has shifted for 3Q deliveries. A report on Sep. 20 of Elon Musk talking to potential ‘record deliveries’ in 3Q (prior record was 112k) with a push to the California market was interpreted by some that deliveries would be soft of consensus. However, expectations have since moved higher. And while the bar has moved higher, we believe Tesla may have enough to clear the bar.""

""**Bar raised on stock into deliveries release**: As opposed to last week post Battery Day, when the 3Q deliveries release was set up to be a disappointment, we’d argue sentiment has arguably increased into the 3Q deliveries release – with the stock decline post Battery Day mostly wiped away. And even if Tesla misses, we’d expect the stock to remain elevated (even if temporarily trading off), as investors would ultimately look past the miss, focusing on Tesla’s robust growth narrative.""",28,0.72
2020-09-15 09:06:39,$TSLA - Tesla weekly app download suggests growth in China,"Goldman:

""Tesla global weekly app downloads have recently been tracking up on a yoy basis, with the most recent full week of global data at up about 20% yoy. (Exhibit 1). Given that Tesla typically has much stronger deliveries in the last month of each quarter, we also show this data on a 3-month moving average basis (Exhibit 2; which helps adjust for the back-end weighted nature of Tesla's deliveries but also is partly using data from 2Q).""

""Tesla's deliveries tend to be back-end weighted in part because in a given quarter the company typically starts building cars that have to be delivered the farthest away first, and this results in a lot of deliveries occurring in the final month of a quarter. 3Q20 could also be impacted by the fact that Tesla had factory downtime in Fremont to make facility improvements in order to increase capacity per Electrek.""

2020-08-20 17:49:33,There are plenty of TSLA bulls. How much are you up? Maxed out 401k and Roth IRA so I bought 2 shares in my Vanguard taxable (small gamble) the morning after 5:1 split was announced. What's your bull or bear thesis?,"[2 shares in at $1464.](https://imgur.com/a/IWH1kfE)

Since maxing out my retirement accounts, I'm building cash in my Vanguard taxable for a home purchase in 5-7 years. 

With the recent TSLA split announcement, I figured why not play a bit with the thought that TSLA could mirror the action that AAPL has seen since its own split announcement. 

Fully aware splits don't create any new equity, but here we are. 

TSLA is the only individual stock I own since I much prefer broad funds.

That said, after a week since split was announced, I'm up over 34%. I thought $1,464 was so high already. I've never owned a stock with this type of volatility. 

I test drove a Model 3 and loved it, but as someone who isn't closely following Elon and TSLA, do you actually think TSLA will ever match its fundamentals? 

Do you think the recent run up is actually driven by Elon and TSLA's actions or purely because of the split announcement?

For the bulls, why do you think TSLA is justified at the current price?

Do any of you who closely follow TSLA feel like the stock is too reliant on Elon (and his antics) and not its core business enterprises?",21,0.69

I realize that this journal entry got a bit lengthy, so I chopped it into three parts, plus a very hand-wavy speculative conclusion part.

----     
The Pump  
-----     

Mid-January 2020, articles begin pumping TSLA as Musk announces share purchases.    
    
_Markets Insider -  Tesla short sellers have lost nearly $12 billion in just 7 weeks_     
     
_Markets Insider - Tesla has yet another biggest bull on Wall Street. Here's why he thinks the stock could surge 57%._    
     
_Electrek - Tesla (TSLA) gets new $800 price target based on its ability to execute_        
     
Musk is no stranger to stock pumping. Last year he advertised a private share price of 420$, ""funding secured"", to draw in investors. It is not surprising that this time the company (or another party) has turned to media outlets to get article placement from a third party. It is frowned-upon, but not uncommon, for companies to pay journalists, through brokers, to place articles in major publications.   

At the same time, mid-January, coordinated social media and message board posts appeared hyping TSLA and urging users to buy stock. Social media posts appeared on reddit, twitter, facebook about the price of Tesla on trajectory for $1000/share. Many influential users were caught in the frenzy and spread the word. A reddit and twitter user named /u/WSBgod began buying calls in TSLA at $600+; posting his positions and urging his large follower base to do the same. Many of these social media posts were well-written, edgy and bear the hallmarks of professional  copywriters.    

----    
The Dump    
----   
Tesla price began to rise. Viral social media posts and positive articles created high demand for TSLA stock, driving retail investors into a frenzy. On some message boards, users were seen urging people to take credit card advances or student loans to buy Tesla stock at $600+.   

At this point, a short-term ""spike"" in Teslas price occured. For the purposes of discussion, we will consider $767 (the stock issue price, discussed below) at market close to be the defining price of the spike.   

This spike began on 02/03 and ended on 02/26. The stock market was open 18 days  during this window. More remarkably, the closing price of TSLA was only above $767 per share on *12 days* during the window.   
**Chart of the 767$ price line and the recent spike**:   
https://gfycat.com/quaintslimyeuropeanpolecat   

It turns out this short stock market spike was no surprise to Tesla. Tesla and Goldman Sachs were already preparing to issue stock during this narrow period. Tesla filed an 8-K on 02/19 to issue  2.65 million new shares at $767 per share. Teslas/Goldman's  ""luck"" allowed them to issue on one of the top ten highest dates in TSLA history.    

Social media and message board influencers sold dreams of $1500 ""moon"" prices to middle-class retail investors. Many of his new investors were young; drawn by the new mobile-based, zero-commision brokers such as Robinhood. These younger investors typically turn to social media for their stock research. 

Many new and inexperienced investors are unfamiliar with stock ""dilution"" (the concept that issuing new stock devalues existing shareholders). Some shareholders even took to message boards to praise Tesla/Goldman for issuing more shares. Tesla raked in $2.31 billion of that cash advance, student loan, and summer job money during this short period of time, by issuing new shares at the $767 price.    

While the stock issue was happening, insiders began exercising options and dumping their stock. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with insiders selling stock. However  they were *very lucky* that this period happened mid-February - directly in-between earnings calls. This is one of the few timeframes outside of their blackout dates (blackout dates tend to cover most dates in the year for executives, particularly around earnings).

Five insiders can be seen exercising (buying) options and dumping stock during the narrow 18-day February spike time frame. Amidst the insider sales there is only one insider purchase - a well-publicized stock purchase by Elon Musk himself.     

https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/TSLA/insider-trades/    

----     
The wreckage settles     
----     

After the dump finished, the retail investor money was safely in the hands of insiders and Teslas cash reserves. Nameless large traders (known as ""whales"") began dumping the shares in high-volume batches, reaping the final harvest of the inflated stock price. Coincidentally, Covid-19 caused a general decrease in stock prices on the NYSE. The stock price plummeted. TSLA is now hovering around ~$400/share on 03/18, less than half the price of the all-time high where retail investors were paying upwards of $800-900 per share.    

Tesla is now $2.31 billion richer (although Tesla's high cash burn rate will incinerate this money within two quarters). Insiders at Tesla have gained hundreds of millions from their timely exit.    

On twitter and message boards, many users are depressed and downtrodden. The investment they purchased during the flurry of hype has lost its value. Many of the users who bought TSLA now joke about suicide or selling their house. Many users who got caught in the Tesla hype are silent - ashamed of their losses. Many are selling their devalued shares at a huge loss and will not return to invest in stocks for the time being.      

-----   
The other kind of speculation   
----    
Stock frenzys are not a new phenomenon. We can blame the media for the unrealistic moonshot expectations towards TSLA during the hype period.     
    
Yet, it is tough not to look at the timing of the entire event and squint:    
* The company orchestrated one of its largest stock issues during a very narrow 12 day market peak window -  a masterstroke in perfect timing and preparation     
* The media blitz ""pump"" occurred despite Teslas high debt load and extremely low car production rate (400k/year).     
* Institutional investors stayed put and let retail investors run in to the slaughter, chasing promises of $1000+ TSLA    
* Tesla insiders dumped their stock during this period       
    
Sadly, the SEC has been in a deep slumber for the past two decades. With the tech industry oligopolies running amok; plus thousands of pump-and-dumps that could only be orchestrated in a now socially-interconnected world, we need their enforcement now more than ever.     
    
Maybe there is some mythical horn we have to blow to rouse the SEC from its slumber. Until then, we can only look at incidents like this and squint at the happenstance. I hope that people far smarter and better researched than myself will look into the Tesla spike and verify that everything is above-board.    
     
""Funding secured""

-----
Edit: Counterpoints
-----

There are a few aspects of this situation that go against my hypothesis that the price was pumped.

* The dump occurred during the Covid-19 outbreak. It is difficult to seperate market manipulation from the general downturn during this period   
* Tesla insiders still hold a large portion of TSLA stock   
* Musk himself purchased stock during the spike. (This is a good point, although I don't believe the stock purchase represents a major buy, considering Musk's enormous wealth. Teslas survival is a point of personal pride to Musk. He has been known to play dirty when his reputation is threatened - he once hired a private investigator to dig up dirt on a dive instructor from Thailand that snubbed him)
* The price rose due to the short squeeze. (This is a counterargument I generally disagree with. The short interest was orders of magnitude smaller than the purchase volume that drove the price to $900+)",1091,0.83

May also have to do with the company stopping orders for the Model Y. May also be a short term correction as people take profits from the ATH.

For all those on the sidelines who watched the price go up in the last few months and not get in - myself included - what do you say about it’s current price? Still overvalued in your opinion? Are you waiting until the price drops more? Are you buying small to average down if it goes further?

I had been one of those sceptics who thought Tesla was in a bubble and would eventually return to around $500-600. However I must admit after lots of research Tesla does seem to be 5 years ahead of other EV makers and i’ve been waiting ever since to see a price drop.

Does this drop in price justify buying a position in Tesla or are you expecting a bigger drop? I personally don’t believe the Model Y news is too shocking, Elon Musk has consistently acknowledged the challenge of mass-scale production.",154,0.86
2021-02-07 07:00:38,For those who are buying company stocks to avoid ETF fees in ARK,"The most frustrating part of getting into any of the 5 main ARK Etf's was sitting every week waiting for a 5% pullback when it keeps going up 8% the previous few days.

I got out of the market right before pandemic hit the US and was glad for about a month that I did.

Overall I am okay with my decision, missed out of growth but I didn’t have risk appetite having gone through 2008 crisis. Only thing that I am regretting is getting out of TSLA and now it’s too hot to touch, I feel. 

The stock is trading at more than 1000 P/E now and the way it is it will continue to rise till the split and may be some after. I know TSLA most times defied the market fundamentals but I am not able to make sense of this rally. I wanted to ask here what do people think. I can’t go in the stock for a week or so because I need to hold for a month before I can sell. I know no one know when this bubble will burst but what I am thinking if this is a bubble or not.

2020-10-02 07:00:55,$TSLA - couple of first takes on Q3 results...,"**Canaccord Genuity:**

""Q3 deliveries fail to beat recently raised expectations TSLA reported BMO Q3 deliveries of 139.3K vehicles with 124K model 3/Ys, slightly above consensus of 136K and 122K, respectively. While this is impressive, given the recent leaked email from Musk (reported by Electrek) and increased Street expectations, we suspect this will come as a material disappointment to bulls.""

""Given the lost day due to full server outage at Tesla a couple of weeks ago, we suspect the company to chalk up the ability to have delivered more without the lost productivity and noting the 145K production figure. We suspect skeptics to question demand.""

""What does this mean? Tesla has operated well during a tumultuous year. Q3 deliveries effectively cement a miss to the 500K guidance. So where are current expectations and what is the chance of achieving this? Current consensus of 480K for 2020 would put the Q4 bar at 161K deliveries.""

""As we look at 161K for Q4 to meet Street, it would suggest delivery figures are likely to come down and thus a risk of lowering Street expectations generally across the board. We of course will have greater details post Q3 call where we can look at ASP and profitability vs. just deliveries. As such, we are not making any adjustments to our model at this time.""

**RBC:**

**3Q20 deliveries may raise some questions**

""3Q20 deliveries of \~139.3k units. Tesla 3Q20 deliveries of \~139.3k units (+53% q/q, +43% y/y). This compared to our 144.6k forecast and 135.9k company-collected consensus. We saw a much wider range of buy-side expectations this quarter from 135k-145k. Model 3/Y deliveries \~124.1k (+56% y/y, +55% q/q). Remember, versus last year Tesla has China M3 capacity and the Model Y, and sequentially was vs. the COVID quarter. Model S/X deliveries \~15.2k (-13% q/q, +43% y/y). 3Q20 production of \~145k units (\~128k 3/Y, \~17k S/X). The company indicated new vehicle inventory declined further in 3Q20 in terms of days of sales (we believe true for overall and Model 3/ Y, though S/X higher). At 2Q20, we believe TSLA had about 18.2k vehicles in cumulative excess production (though we understand not all of these vehicles may be sellable inventory). Based on these numbers, that figure is now 23.9k.""

""**Two things investors will focus on**. 1) TSLA states its global capacity is 690k, expanding to 790k by end of 2020. That translates to 172.5/qtr (going to 197.5k/qtr). Now we realize you can’t just quite do the divide by 4 math because of calendar timing and downtime, but under this simple math, TSLA is at best operating at 84% utilization (and expanding capacity). We do believe there could be some supply constraint, but bears may also point to some potential demand concerns. Some of the early data we’ve seen in Europe suggests sales may be softer than we expected, and we continue to believe Model 3 sales in the US are down y/y (but Model Y helps US demand). And remember, Elon again alluded at Battery Day that one of the issues for demand is affordability. So even if the longerterm growth story at TSLA may be intact, we do wonder if demand will continue to flatten out nearer-term. 2). At Battery Day, Elon indicated on track for 2020 deliveries to be +30–40% y/y, which translates to 478k–515k units. The midpoint is right near prior 500k unit guide, but we do believe this was a slight lowering of expectations. To hit the low end, TSLA would need to deliver 159k units, 14% above the 3Q20 level. 159k is about 10% above the 3Q20 production level. As mentioned above, we believe the absolute inventory increased slightly, so maybe there is a little more roomto use that for 4Q20 deliveries, but otherwise the production rate needs to increase to hit the number. It’s not an unattainable goal, in our view, and is most likely dependent on the Shanghai rate continuing to increase and maybe some more efficiency out of Fremont. But getting to 500k (which would require 181k or 30% above 3Q20) seems increasingly difficult. And of course, both figures require a step-up in demand, so we wonder if we will see more price adjustments or promotions.""",10,0.7

2020-09-17 23:38:38,"TSLA Weekly Covered Calls Strategy, Please evaluate","Hi All,

Could you please evaluate this strategy I am missing something:  
Thank you for your time.

I have 300 TSLA shares. I am playing this long term, meaning I am not planning to sell them at least for next 5 years (I will still evaluate the company every few months just to make sure. But as of now I am comfortable holding it for next 5 years).

Now, I am thinking about writing weekly covered calls for TSLA. I prefer not to lose my shares, so I will write options with shortest time (1 week) and highest strike ($800 currently).

Currently, these are option prices:  
**TSLA, Sell Call, Strike: $800, Expiry 09-25-2020, Premium: $1.00**  
So I will get $300 every week for 3 contracts I can write. Thats like $1200 per month and for my financial situation $1200 per month is handsome chunk. Ideally I want to repeat this every week to earn \~$1000 per month (Again, shorted time and highest possible strike options only)

Disadvantages I can think of:  
\#1. If Tesla rockets to more than $800 within a week, then I will loose the upside above $800. But I think there is very less chance for a $400B company to double within a week.

\#2. If TSLA drops a lot I cannot sell my shares unless I buy my options back. But as I mentioned, I am in this for 5+ years - So I dont think I will sell TSLA unless there is some disaster.

Please let me know if I am missing something here.

2021-02-04 05:39:29,10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.  Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why:

1. THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, [https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq](https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq) .  The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work).  Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO.  A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs.  Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade.
2. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, [https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/](https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/) .  This ETF is... highly intriguing.  It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%).  They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM.  Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily).  What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology.  Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit.  The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO.  The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB.   SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF.  Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive.  Index methodology here: [https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf](https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf)
3. DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl) .  Its methodology is in the prospectus, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus) .  Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to [etfrc.com](https://etfrc.com). So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way.  Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ.  Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF!
4. SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund) . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change.""  ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s) ).  Methodology here: [https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index](https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index) .  It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in.  It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year!
5. FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, [https://freedometfs.com/frdm/](https://freedometfs.com/frdm/) . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores.  Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red.  If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like.  Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF.  Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox!
6. EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund) . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index.  Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil.  It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all).  Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung.
7. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf) .  One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets.  Really heavy on tech and luxury.  If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like.  High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH.
8. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, [https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html](https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html) .  Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options.  Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times.  Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF.  Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement.  Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X.
9. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, [https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx) .  Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries.  But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure.  Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund.  There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design.
10. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf) .  This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF.  You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise.  But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values.  Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk.  A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields.

ok, here's a bonus #11:

11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA) .  This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year.  But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted.  US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along.  Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector.

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future.

What do you guys think?  Any of those look like something you might invest in?  Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?

They're off significantly from their all time highs but I purchased these initial lots a long while back with what was designated as ""play money"".

(Assuming they make it),"Sorry if this comes across as a stupid question - I'm fairly new to the stock market scene! My question is: what will actually happen to the SP of TSLA if and when it gets included in the S&P500? My immediate thoughts are that all the funds tracking S&P500 will then have to pour money into TSLA (amount commensurating to however many % TSLA's market cap constitutes in the combined market cap of all S&P500 companies). If my logic is true, then we can expect a certain rise of TSLA's SP for a period of time after its S&P500 inclusion due to the large number of buy orders flooding in from various funds tracking S&P500, followed by a huge plunge due to profit taking. Something tells me that it's not that straightforward, otherwise it'll be a no brainer for investors to invest in TSLA now, then sell a few days after S&P500 inclusion, i.e. after the big money pours in.

2021-02-13 08:49:05,Some valuations are absurd - I am going 10% short,"**Microsoft was a great company in 1999. It posted record revenues of $20bn, record net income of $8bn, and soared to a market cap of $615bn.**

**With that being said, if you had invested in Microsoft at the top of the dot com bubble you would not have seen a return on your investment until 2016.**

I believe we are now in the midst of a similar timeline. Some valuations are through the roof without any grounding in reality. It is hard to know when it will correct but I am convinced that at some point investors will once again begin valuing companies as the value of their future free cash flows + a risk premium.

For this reason I am adapting my personal investment strategy from 100% long to **110% long and -10% short** with some select picks.

I will be diversifying my shorts and limiting their initial notional value, wary of irrationality continuing. I expect this to be an investment strategy I can stick to for at least 1 year.

**I'd love to hear any contrarian views to my thesis and any thoughts on my short picks or suggestions.**

---

My picks (each will be -1% of my portfolio):

**1. TSLA** Not much needed to be said. Great company, love their products and direction. $800bn valuation is ludicrous.

**2. SHOP** $180bn valuation for $2.5bn revenue in 2020. 70% growth rate is great but where is my risk premium for my investment today?

**3. UBER** $113bn valuation with a -$22bn accumulated deficit. Gave up on self driving (their roadmap to profitability?) back in December. Propped up by SoftBank.

**4. ZM** $126bn valuation with $2bn TTM revenue and $400m net income. Guys, this is a company who offer video communication software. 0 MOAT or risk premium.

**5. SNOW** $85bn market cap, $489m TTM revenue and -$400m net income. For a data cloud service (hello have you heard of AWS/Azure/etc.?)

**6. DASH** $65bn market cap, $2bn revenue, -$200m net income. Financials aren't the most atrocious on this list but food delivery services (like ride sharing) are too location specific. No roadmap to global domination here.

**7. LMND** $10bn market cap for a ""tech"" insurance company with less than $100m revenue, -$100m net income. Their S-1 is filled with talk about their AI. Their ""chatbot AI"" on their website is a web form with a photo of a woman. Seriously?

--- 
Picks I am less bearish on but still considering going short.

**8. ABNB** $128bn market cap, $5bn revenue pre-covid. This one is hard for me. I like this company and think they have potential as a global business. Also a great pick post-covid. But I think $128bn is still too insane. Could be convinced otherwise.

**9. NIO** $94bn for the Chinese Tesla. Close to bankruptcy pre-2020 EV hype. Now has some momentum but $94bn worth? China growth can be scary though...

**10. SPCE** $13bn valuation. Richard Branson's pet project run rampant with a Chamath SPAC. Space, very cool. Return on investment is where sorry?",158,0.85

2020-10-01 21:08:10,Fun fact: if the original AT&T (pre-1984) was still around AMZN would have a market cap 3x higher than it and TSLA would be bigger,I get these numbers by adding together the market caps of AT&T and Verizon which together would be the original company. That makes me question the valuations of some of these mega cap tech companies. You mean to tell me that TSLA is worth as much as a company with a monopoly on all phone service and with a deep media library with the merger from time Warner? I don’t know. I just can’t see the justification for it. And yes I know T and Verizon are burdened by debt and would probably have much higher market caps without it but to be it boggles the mind that a company that makes 350k cars a year (smaller than GM in the 1930s) is more valuable than an utter monopoly on phone service. Perhaps I’m missing something here but it’s giving me big 2000 vibes.,0,0.36
2021-01-25 04:46:04,GME's latest Short Interest after Jan 22 EOD is 70.97M. Cost of borrowing also increased," After Friday's close, SI reached 70.97M from Jan 21's SI of 70.46M. Institutional cost of borrowing also increased very slightly to 24.2%. 

 [GME SI left to the rightmost column(exported from ORTEX data)](https://imgur.com/a/0gQjYT6)

We know GME absolutely ripped in Friday due to gamma hedging. Some old shorts covering could have been the main reason behind the ignition switch but I am not very confident about that.

GME is already ripping in pre-market and I don't know what's triggering that. Maybe it's retail euphoria.

Looks like we will continue to have gamma squeezes, tweets from Papa Cohen etc until shorts are forced to cover and close most of their shorts. I am changing my thesis. I thought we will see a slow TSLA-esque short-covering in GME. Looks like we are setting up for something much quicker.

""we struggle to explain the run-up to the stock split which academically doesn’t change the value of Tesla equity but could help fuel retail investor interest. We still view Tesla as fundamentally overvalued and having to grow into its valuation."" ""When we look at Tesla in our simple two-stage model to try to understand embedded expectations (using a 7% discount rate, 4% terminal growth rate) to justify current levels (never mind future appreciation), Tesla would need to grow FCF at a \~36% CAGR for 10-yrs.""

**Barclays (Underweight rating, $125 price target)** \- ""Elon Musk has been a proponent of the science fiction theme that the world we know is just a simulation – or one big computer video game. And in a computer simulation, laws of physics and finance in the real world need not apply. The last few months of TSLA trading have defied two conventional stock market rules of thumb – that SP500 index inclusion is worth \~5-15% and that share splits are value-neutral. And with a potential SP500 index rebalancing in September, and Battery Day on Sept. 22nd the stock price momentum may continue. While we noted after 2Q that when Stripping out reg credits and made-in-China revenue to focus on ‘same store’ Fremont factory sales undercuts the growth narrative that has propelled the stock, we are not holding our breath for the market to take note as the bull narrative continues to be that TSLA will dominate EVs, Energy and robotaxis. And this narrative will likely allow TSLA to finance expansion –leading us to raise our PT (split adjusted) but we retain our UW – and we’re still not clear on when momentum breaks.""

**Goldman (Neutral rating, $295 price target) comments on today's announcement of $5bn equity raise:**

""We believe key points to help contextualize this news includes:

1) $5 bn of equity issuance would represent about 1% incremental shares based on the 8/31/2020 close.

2) The prospectus states that the use of proceeds would be to further strengthen the balance sheet, and for general corporate purposes.

3) Tesla has a history of issuing equity, but unlike this proposed offering Tesla has typically announced offerings on the day it filed or within a few weeks of filing its 10-Q/10-K. Further, while the company commented on its 4Q19 EPS call that it was not capital constrained, investing as fast as it sensibly could and generating positive cash flow, Tesla has also raised capital post making those comments (the company last issued new equity in February 2020). Finally, the company has capacity expansion plans underway at several factories, and per its last 10-K Tesla expects average annual capex to be $2.5-$3.5 bn from 2020-2022.

We therefore consider the news to be somewhat of a surprise especially related to the timing, but not a shock given Tesla's history of equity raises and its future expansion plans.""",0,0.33
2021-01-24 05:09:56,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

I would argue that the valuations of both TSLA, NIO and other large EV companies is seriously undervalued - I'm not basing this on the number of cars they manufacture nor the effectiveness of their electric battery potential but on the billions they're investing in the development of full self driving automation.

In the next 10 years, we are likely to see full automation especially with the advent of quantum computing leading to a huge increase in computational power ([https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/ibm-promises-1000-qubit-quantum-computer-milestone-2023](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/ibm-promises-1000-qubit-quantum-computer-milestone-2023)) - The companies that are heavily investing in developing this technology aren't the classic car manufactures such as GM, Chevrolet or Chrysler but instead the large EV companies that have grown exponentially in the past year. Like many people I'm viewing companies like NIO or TSLA as tech companies and not car manufacturers. They're main value is in the code they develop for automation.

Once full autonomous driving becomes realistic, these companies can lease their code as a service and basically replace the need for any job which requires drivers i.e. delivery drivers, truck drivers, taxi drivers.

The main example I've been using for this is Domino's Pizza in the UK - They have about 1126 stores in the UK, let's say they conservatively they hire 5 delivery drivers per store and those drivers on average work about 5 days a week and a total of 6 hours per day (the three hours around lunch and three around dinner) - Let's also assume they only get paid minimum wage - This comes out to a total expenditure of about £80mill per year ($110 mill) for dominoes just based on paying their drivers wages, not countering in fuel or other expenditures that they do also cover - And that's only one company in the UK.

If automation occurs, which again these companies are investing heavily in and the underlying infrastructure and technology is beginning to reach basic requirements, these EV companies can create a code as service model along with the profit from actually selling the car and basically make drivers redundant

My argument is that basically at the moment these EV companies are amazon in their bookshop phase, people are betting that they'll sell lots of books (cars in this case because they're clean energy) and I think they're going to end up becoming juggernauts that basically take over our daily lives to the same extent amazon now does

Obvs I might be wrong and in fact I'd love to hear some bearish arguments - I'm not saying we're not in a bubble but I think these companies in 10 years time will be steals at their current prices

&#x200B;

Edit: A lot of people have mentioned the quantum computing point and how far we are away from it in normal conditions- which is a reasonable and valid point but I would argue that if you look at the rate of change of technological advances in the past 20 years (your phone in 2000 vs your phone now) - its not that crazy to say that this growth has risen exponentially and will carry on to meaning that **ONE OF THE MANY BARRIERS** to full automation will be knocked down (i.e reaching the necessary computational power for an ML model to process images real time) and could act as a domino effect",155,0.69
2020-08-18 07:03:49,Does TSLA break index investing model?,"Tesla threads seem to be mushrooming lately, so I thought I'll join the fun with a related puzzler.

So, a major factor in TSLA rally is the fact that TSLA, finally being profitable for a full year, is now eligible for inclusion in S&P 500. However, this inclusion is pretty historic as TSLA seems to be the largest company ever to be included in S&P--it falls in the S&P top 10 by market cap. This is unprecedented.

It means that index funds will have to buy TSLA in proportion to its market cap. Remember, nearly half of a US stock market is in passive funds. Now, suddenly, passive funds don't seem so passive. They are going to drive the TSLA stock up, because they have no choice but to buy at high prices, smart money is trying to front-run them, and all in all the index funds are starting to look like a whale stranded on a beach.

Sure, over the long term, the losses might even out, and this is perhaps once in a lifetime event, which might not generate as big losses for passive funds as it seems, but I wonder... what will be the outlook on passive investing after all this plays out? Will the smartest strategy for retail investor still be to buy Vanguard and forget it? Or, will the passive investing, especially when you don't have much control over your retirement plan, become ""another way for Wall Street 1% to exploit 99%?""

If you have your money in index funds, are you looking for a way to exit while you still can, or buy TSLA options? If you're looking to put some money in the index funds, are you concerned? If you're an index fund manager, do you have any strategies to offset possible losses when an algorithm tells you to buy at a bad time? What are your thoughts on index funds in this situation?

Disclaimer: I own some TSLA shares.

(If I may ask, please avoid talking about Tesla itself. I don't really care what anybody thinks about Musk's tweet of the day, or about Tesla cars or revenue, at least not in this thread - there are several other threads for that.)",4,0.61
2021-03-07 11:21:11,ROKU DD based on the latest SEC 10K,"Since  there has been some discussion on ARKK, and the fact that I do not want  to touch TSLA, I figured, why not take a crack at ROKU

I  love Roku's products - I have a streamer at home, and the company is  well run, for the most part (my BIL worked there for a little)

1. They have 124M shares out. So, at the current quote of slightly above $350, their market cap is $44 Billion
2. 2020 revenue was $1.778 Billion, up 57.5 % over 2019  

   1. Player (hardware) revenue was $510 M, up 31.6 % YoY (good number)
   2. Platform revenue was $1.27 B, up 71.1 % YoY (excellent number)
3. Gross margins were 45.45% up 158 basis points YoY  

   1. Player (HW) margins were 8.55% up 414 bps YoY
   2. Platform (SW) margins were 60.3% down 413 bps YoY
4. Number of shares were up 7.6 % YoY
5. Op-ex was up 47.9 % (S&M 67 %, G&A 48.8 %, R&D 34.25 %), all YoY
6. They do not use much leverage, current portion of LTD is below $100M
7. Cash position of a little over a billion dollars

So,  ""player"" is their foot in the door, but ""platform"" is where they make  money. Most of ROKU's platforms are not in the premium segment, but  found in the value Smart TV segment

ROKU's  current market share is a tad shy of 10% of the \~300M Smart TVs sold in  2020, and ROKU claims a 33% market share in the USA

*I got into this wanting to trash ROKU. Instead, I ""see"" what they are accomplishing,* ***with the exception of earning money (net income)***

Valuation Method: Look at HW and SW separately

1. A $510M HW company with a 32 % growth rate, and 8.5% gross margins. Hard to value at over 2x sales. So, let's call it $1 Billion
2. A  $1.27 Billion SW company with 60% gross margins, and a 71% growth rate.  This is harder to put a firm number on, but anywhere from 10x to 20x  sales. So, $12.7 B to $25 B
3. Add them up, and I get a range of $14 B to $26 B, or a stock price between $113 to $209
4. For reference, Morningstar's FVE estimate is $150 with a high degree of uncertainty

**Conclusion: ROKU is seriously overvalued at the current ""depressed"" quote of $350+/share.** *My valuation metrics are ""more than generous"".* ***This is not financial advice***

2021-02-09 04:23:19,Second Quarter Results: 6 months into the /r/investing underrated stock survey and the average return was 72% (37% as a portfolio),"Building on a previous post ([http://redd.it/i2thge/](http://redd.it/i2thge/)) asking the community to pick underrated stocks, there was interest in seeing the quarterly performance of everyone's picks

The first quarter can be seen here: [http://redd.it/jti14m/](http://redd.it/jti14m/)

For this quarter, the key takeaways are as follows:

* Overall average return of 72.2% (driven by the GME pick)
* If you invested equally in each stock, returns would have been 41.9%, or if you bought one of each stock, returns would have been 37.5%
* 86% of the 254 picks have shown a positive return, with 80% greater than 10% return and 20% greater than 100% return
* Highest returning pick: Gamestock (GME) at 1342% flagged by  /u/EmployerOfTheMonth, to which they stated *""If it goes up, people will think I'm some sort genius for going against the crowd, if it goes down, people will just mindly brush me off as a moron for actually thinking this was underrated""*
* If you invested in the top 5 most upvoted stocks (NET, CRSP, STNE, NVDA, NOK), you would have seen an average return of 62%
* If you invested in the top 5 most controversial stocks (TSLA, WD, AMD, LMND, UBER), you would have seen a return of 93%
* If you had invested equally in the stocks with greater than 10% return in the first 30 days, your total return would be 53.1%

In graphical format, you can also see the results here: [https://i.imgur.com/CzEYTxv.png](https://i.imgur.com/CzEYTxv.png)

2021-01-02 21:19:22,Reasons We May Not Be in a Bubble,"I'm seeing a lot of posts comparing this to the 2000 dot-com bubble. Here's a breakdown of why we're likely not anywhere close to 2000 levels of craziness.

**First:**  During the dot-com era, the Nasdaq Composite's price-to-earnings valuation ran up as high as 200. By comparison, the index's P/E today is a relatively tame 28, only modestly higher from 23 at the end of 2019. 

**Second:** Interest rates were a very attractive 6% which provided a strong alternative to stocks. No such outlet exists today unless you trust bitcoin, or want to invest in paper gold.

**Third:** Much of the value gains we're seeing in the market can be tied directly to the fact that people who invest are making similar or better money this year, and spending significantly less causing them to save more and invest more:

[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html)

**Fourth:** The rest of the growth can largely be attributed to increased liquidity from all of the money printing. Stocks tend to mirror an increase in the money supply with their value making them a great hedge against inflation. The valuations of the 2000s weren't backstopped by QE or increased savings, making them much shakier.

**Fifth:** The money printing will likely go on for a while. People mistakenly assume we're printing against our 22T dollar economy when we're really printing against the 80-100T global economy for which are the reserve currency. A weak dollar benefits the global economy, and benefits us because we are the trading floor for the global economy.

This is a long but very illuminating read on why QE is necessary and actually helpful:

[https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/](https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/)

**My Take:** There are a few stocks that are out of control with their valuations (Hi TSLA!), and a few sectors that are overvalued, but overall the market looks to be on sturdy ground with the increased savings, and the increased liquidity. There will be peaks and valleys, but I think there's a lot of room to grow, especially once the vaccine is widespread.",3034,0.96
2021-02-06 11:55:14,Best long term investment in the world is in water (desalination business),"Hi guys,

I  gave it a little thought and to me logically, obviously, factually etc.  the best long term investment (at least 20-30 years) in the world is in  water. I might have been slightly inspired by the ending of The Big  Short where it's revealed that Michael Burry invests mostly in water -  he is also short in TSLA :). I was also inspired by Netflix's Rotten documentary series - the episode Troubled Water. 

Specifically I am talking about investing in companies dealing with the desalination of seawater business.

Facts supporting my claim/analysis:

Human  population doesn't stop growing and the planet is already overpopulated (around 2-3 billions more than it can normally support). This only means more and more water consumption. Population growth will reduce in 2050 or around that time but my idea is achieving growth until then.

It's projected that many areas around the world have medium to high water shortage risk around 2040.

Long term investments like Bitcoin and Gold cannot save you from dehydration if there is no water  to buy/drink. If two commodities (not essential to keeping you alive)  have trillions of $ of market cap, imagine what market cap could the  drinkable water reach if it becomes globally scarce.

Still  most water we use is freshwater found in nature - this water is  exponentially decreasing due to the industry demands, the pollution and  the increase in population. Global climate change probably helps as  well. There are also rains but not all rain water is drinkable. Sometimes they are also acid.

Literally almost everything  costs thousands of liters of water to make but we don't notice it  because there is still a lot of free/cheap and easily accessible water  for use. A cup of coffee takes 150 liters to produce. A kilogram of meat  takes 5000 - 20000 liters. 1 kg of chocolate takes 17 000 liters. Sure  not all of that is drinkable water but it's not dirty water as well so  water treatment plants will benefit from the need of such water.

Desalination  of seawater is a way to turn most of  the planet's water into drinkable water. The freshwater sources took  probably thousands of years to form and we almost depleted them mostly  in the last two centuries! Many people pointed out it's expensive and not economical but they don't consider the labor value if water becomes several times more expensive. Desalination plants wouldn't change much in price but the underlying product will which could make it an economically efficient investment.

The  desalination business is growing steady and is still very small which looks like a great investment opportunity. Market cap is just $32  billion. The global desalination capacity increased by 65% between 2010  and 2015 without any major global water events. Even in California it's  already a perpetual water crisis without an easy solution. With the fast  depletion of water everyone around the world will be forced to look for  alternatives and they could turn to desalination plants as there are not much alternatives.

At present there are **35 desalination plants** only in the UAE. They have no other efficient ways to get potable water as there are simply no freshwater sources around.

How to invest?

The  only almost perfect company I managed to find is CWCO (Consolidated  Water). I have stocks in it but I cannot make a very good recommendation  as I haven't discovered alternatives and I might be misleading  potential investors. I call the company almost perfect because it deals  with everything related to the business. But one issue is that currently  it heavily relies on tourism due to the location of it's plants. Do you  know of other 100% desalination companies?

Most  of the currently available investments in water are overall a joke -  water ETFs/indexes contain mostly water supply/utility/sewage companies  and/or companies which use a lot of water which is very non optimal if  one expects the price of water to increase in time. Think about it. If  you know that gold will increase in price would you invest in a company  which finds gold or in one which sells shovels for digging of gold (and  other minerals)...

Edit: I've corrected some initial wrong claims for which my apologies. Thanks a lot for the feedback and suggestions! I've added also my second inspiration.",394,0.77

2021-02-12 08:24:05,TODAY is the DAY! Today we will find out if Warren Bought Tesla during Q3 & Q4,"For the past two-quarters, people have been wondering whether Berkshire Hathaway or not. In Q3  Berkshire Hathaway added a new position that was not disclosed in 13F, people were wondering that was legal or not? and it is legal,  Berkshire Hathaway secured permission from the regulators to not disclose its most recent purchase. That permission only last one reporting period, which was Q3. Today, we'll find out what that purchase was,  and I'm thinking it was TESLA. Is only a matter of hours before we find out. If it is revealed that  Berkshire Hathaway bought TESLA, that is a gave changer.

So far Vanguard and Blackrock have increased their position in TESLA, with Warren on board we could see $1,000 by the beginning of April.

I will keep an eye on the SEC website this afternoon and let you guys know whether he bought it or not.

2021-02-19 20:47:34,DD - Clover Health Investment (CLOV) - Researched so you can decide,"**Intro:**

Decided to look into Clover Health (Ticker: CLOV) since I’ve been hearing recommendation on it for the dip. Started with all the pros of the company and thought it was great! Growth! Growth! Growth! But then once I got to the cons that hype dropped to the ground fast. I wanted to create this post to save time for anyone that might be interested in CLOV. Citations are at the end so you can do your own research. I do have a position in CLOV as I think the stock could rebound a little via technical analysis. Not a financial advice.

**Summary (if lazy):**

A stock that was hyped by Chamath. If cleared by DOJ and short, there are potential for growth. However, some allegations are hard to turn your head the other way. Also, important to note that it’s David vs bunch of Goliath in this heavily regulated industry. CEO kinda sketchy. At this point, cons over weighs the pros.

Atm price dropped down to a pretty good resistance near $10.60 - $11.00, I’ll be buying hoping for rebound with news fading away and earnings on March 1.

My position atm is **~~15 $12.5 CALL 5/21~~**

**Update 2/22:** After further research, seeing how every other MA company has had bad reaction after earnings, I've decided to let go my position today.

*\*\*Post will be edited and updated based off any informative comments.*

**Basic Info of the Company:**

**1** **About the company**

* Clover health is a data driven healthcare technology company (Backed by Alphabet Inc/Google) based in San Francisco that provides Medicare Advantage products to seniors and low-income members. As of early 2020 they had 57,000 members with plans offered in 34 counties across seven state. Their plan for expansion will bring coverage to a total of 64 additional counties. This expansion will increase Clover’s market opportunity to nearly 5 million Medicare eligible.

**2** **Difference between Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage plan**

* Original Medicare (parts A and B) is offered by the government and covers some of the costs of hospitals (part A) and doctor visits (part B) – but it may not offer the full coverage you need. This can have high copays and coinsurance, which can lead to significant costs if you need to visit the hospital.
* Medicare Advantage plans (part C) give you all the coverage of original Medicare and often include part D prescription drug coverage. In addition, they may offer dental and vision benefit + others…

**3** **What’s different about Clover Advantage Plan**

* As stated at #1, Clover Health provides Medicare Advantage Plan. Which means they will cover everything stated above in #2. Additionally, they give you access to better prescription drug coverage than standalone part D plans, as well as additional benefits like low cost.

**4 They have a unique model in health insurance**

* Clover partners with primary care physicians using its software platform, the Clover Assistant, to deliver data-driven, personalized insights at the point of care.

# Pros

**1. Clover Assistant**

* This is their flagship platform that aggregates millions of relevant health data points – including claims, medical charts, and diagnostics, among others – and uses machine learning to synthesize that data with member-specific information. This provides physicians with actionable and personalized insights at the point of care, offering suggestions for medications and dosages as well as the need for tests or referrals, among other, to ultimately improve health outcomes^(1\*).
* Basically, this new software makes the doctors happy (unlike the legacy systems) and makes the patients happy as it allows them to save money and have better patient outcomes.

**2.** **Fastest Growing Medicare advantage insurer in the US**

* Clover captured an average of 50% of the net increase in membership across its established markets over the last three years. Because of their target demographic, it makes it easier for them to expand into historically undeserved and rural communities. As mentioned above, they are planning to expand into an additional 74 counties and announced a new partnership with Walmart to make joint Clover-Walmart plans available to half a million medicare-eligibles in the eight Georgia counties.

**3. The market**

* The health market is one of the largest in the country representing $3.8 trillion or 17.8% of gross domestic product in 2019. Furthermore, healthcare expenditures are forecasted to grow to $6.2 trillion by 2028. An important part of this market is the insurance industry, and more specifically the Medicare plans which in 2020 had more than 62 million people enrolled in, and 39% of those people (24.1million) enrolled in Medicare advantage plans.^(2\*)

&#x200B;

# Cons

**1.** **Hindenburg Research**

This is one of the major catalysts to investors when it comes to investing in CLOV. I’ll go over some of the main issue from the Hindenburg research and answers provided by Clover Health. If you’d like to check out the report yourself checkout citation below^(3\*).

It’s important to note that Clover Health did provide a rebuttal/answers (quite long) to all the points on Hindenburg Research^(4\*). Hindenburg then replied to that as well lol^(5\*).

&#x200B;

>*Critically Clover has not disclosed that its business model and its software offering, called the clover assistant, are under active investigation by the DOJ, which is investigating at least 12 issues ranging from kick backs to marketing practices to undisclosed third-party deals, according to a civil investigative demand we obtained.*

* Clover Response - Discussed to lawyer about it, and they said it’s not necessary to let the public know.
* Thoughts – Really comes down to SPEC vs IPO, with SPEC being looser and in the grey area. It would have been the right thing to inform the public investors of these information, now they’ll have to deal with all the lawsuits. Next, the civil investigative demand from DOJ was received by a formal employee of CLOV and not CLOV itself. CLOV did receive a request for information from DOJ but not a civil investigative demands or subpoenas from DOJ. This tells me it’s unclear if an investigation have been opened for CLOV or if it’s just inquiries jumping around.

&#x200B;

>Clover has a thinly disclosed subsidiary called “Seek Insurance”. Seek makes no mention of its relationship with Clover on its website yet misleadingly advertises to seniors that it offers “independent” and “unbiased” advice on selecting Medicare plans. It claims, “We don’t work for insurance companies. We work for you”, despite literally being owned by Clover, an insurance company. Its activities are also under investigation by the DOJ.

* Clover Response – Seek is a start up that is set up as a separate company from clover. Provides seek sales in the most recent AEP: #1 Cigna:20%, #2 Humana:20%, #3 CVS/Aetna:17%, #4 Clover:13.5%...
* Thoughts – Doesn’t look good on Clover’s end. Seek can’t state it provides unbiased report when 50% of its stake is owned by clover.

&#x200B;

>Multiple former employees explained that much of Clover’s sales are fueled by a major undisclosed relationship between Clover and an outside brokerage firm controlled by Clover’s Head of Sales, Hiram Bermudez. One former employee estimated Bermudez drove \~68% of Clover’s total sales, though was unclear on the amount coming from the undisclosed relationship.

* Clover Response – Admits that there is transaction between B&H assurance and says Bermudez still work on behalf of B&H in case he quits Clover.
* Thoughts – Admitting to this is good but 100% conflict of interest. However, its not unusual for insurance companies to use brokers.

&#x200B;

>Clover reported that “onboarded” physicians used Clover Assistant for 92% of member visits in 2019, but never defined “onboarded”. We found that less than half of Clover’s in-network doctors are considered “Clover Preferred”. What is the definition of an “onboarded” physician? What percentage of Clover’s in-network doctors actually use the Clover Assistant?

* Clover Response –onboarding = physicians that went through training for clover assistant.contracting = explained benefit of clover assistant to the physicians and they have agreed to use it.Currently 22% of all in-network primary care physicians are live. This correlate to 4% of the total in-network physicians. In YE2020 56% of the membership were attributed to one of those 22% live PCPs. And an additional 11% are attributed to a PCP who is contracted but in the onboarding pipeline. In conclusion, 67% total coverage of clover assistant as of YE2020
* Thoughts – wordings are confusing on clovers part, but the numbers do not look as bad.

&#x200B;

>Clover claims its software “delights” physicians, but according to doctors and former employees we interviewed, they use it because Clover pays them extra to use it. Physicians are paid $200 per visit to use the software, twice the normal reimbursement rate for a Medicare visit.

* Clover Response – just incentivizing to use the software. The $200 is not to use the software but represents the overall payment that covers both the PCP office visit and the use of the clover assistant.
* Thoughts – Clover were pretty up front about this issue, not too relevant imo.

&#x200B;

>In a CNBC interview announcing the Clover transaction, Chamath proclaimed, unprompted, “they create transparency…they don’t motivate doctors to up code or do all kinds of things to get paid”. A former employee explained to us that the DOJ is specifically asking about upcoding, or the practice of overbilling Medicare.

* Clover Response – agrees upcoding is a problem in the industry. They pay pcp fixed flat payment per office visit which does not incentivize physicians to up code. They keep old diagnosis just in case, so it shows up again
* Thoughts – I don’t think it was well addressed how their system fails to remove old irrelevant diagnoses which could affect Medicare advantage reimbursements leading to upcoding.

&#x200B;

**2.** **CEO of Clover Health is kinda sketchy**

Before I start, it’s important to note that these information below were available in 2020 before the merger announcement. I’ll just directly copy paste what Hindenburg report wrote but you can find different articles on google^(3\*).

* Prior to founding Clover, CEO Vivek Garipalli owned 3 New Jersey hospitals through a company called CarePoint Health. CarePoint was publicly lambasted for price-gouging; its hospital charged the highest prices for emergency room treatment in the entire country. For example, local media reported that Garipalli’s hospitals charged a teacher $9,000 for a bandaged finger and a tetanus shot, and another patient $17,000 for 5-6 stiches on a cut hand.
* CarePoint’s predatory price-gouging was lucrative. But in 2020, New Jersey legislators accused Garipalli – now a public company CEO – of siphoning over $157 million from his hospital network through a byzantine web of LLC shell entities. The transactions left the hospitals financially crippled, leading to layoffs and a liquidating sale process to new owners.

**3.** **Hyped by Chamath Palihapaitityasfga**

* People love Chamath

I know my feelings are not rational, yet they are bothering me.","I have been DCA for a few years now, but recently I have been worried more and more about a potential market crash. I know that those cannot be predicted, but I cannot help but deep inside feel like the market is being weird right now. With what happened to Tesla, and more and more people finding out about investing and dumping their entire savings into $GME or $TSLE because it will go to the moon for sure.

Obviously we all know it will crash at some point, and rationally I know that there is no point in trying to predict a crash and cashing out. But, that doesn't make me feel better. Can someone show me some math that will make me more confident?

2020-08-31 13:21:15,Investopedia Simulator TSLA AAPL split glitch.,"Hi. I am an actual investor, but I use Investopedias service to test out prospective stocks before buying them. 

My issue is that I own $2,000,000 dollars of AAPL and $1,000,000 of TSLA (In real life and the simulator, don’t worry I own plenty other stocks too.) 

TSLA and AAPL stocks just split, and in real life this did not effect me since I was compensated. But in the simulator it shows a loss of $2,000,000. 

Does this happen normally and will it resolve itself with time? Does it just take a while for it to process splits? Or do I have to abandon the simulator? It is useful because while I own the exact same stocks on the simulator and in real life, it is good to test the waters, and it is nice to have open on another monitor to see how my stocks are doing at a glance. Help is appreciated.

2021-01-08 20:00:52,How do I handle jealousy and missed opportunities?,"There's been an influx of successes and high returns posted in this recent market, and whenever I look at these posts, I tend to get upset about missing these opportunities. My heart sinks whenever I see another post about how someone retired early due to an early TSLA stock or how they paid off their mortgage because of BTC or AMZN or whatever. I want to desperately have an opportunity like that.

I've been mildly interested in investing for a while, but I'm a poor 19-year-old university student so I have pretty much no stable income and a severe lack of knowledge in investing. I want to invest now because of these posts, but I know I reasonably shouldn't because I'd be investing with my emotions, I only have around $5,000 in my bank account and no stable income is coming in.

How do I handle this FOMO and this jealousy?

I've read a few of the top comments, and they gave me some much needed perspective on my situation. My jealously has subsided somewhat after reading the top comments and having some time to myself. I hope other people can use some of the advice given on this post to help them with their own feelings of jealousy and FOMO.

I posed two different models in the last 6 years that I'm continually revisiting and updating based on new data that's available to me.

Here's the first one below from 6 years ago where I attached a $450 price target by end of 2018
https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1k15cb/my_model_of_tsla_through_2013/?st=k5h2987i&sh=78a9694b

Here's the second one I posted a year later with a price target of $800 by end of 2020
https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1yn1kx/my_revised_model_of_tesla_tsla_by_2023/?st=k5h26rti&sh=43f78d64

It appears that my models are running roughly a year behind of where my assumptions are ending up, so I figured I'd share my latest model for your viewing and entertainment pleasure.

In no way am I trying to insinuate that my models are somehow predicting where Tesla's price is going to end up - I'm simply sharing my thought process with you fine folks in the investing community to gather feedback and understand different points of view.

See below model:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUPfQhpFfax8lYC4iyvYT-gD_i9LIRkngFB_o6MZXA8/edit?usp=sharing

My broad assumptions:

* There will be a 90,000,000 global new vehicle market in 2028
* Roughly 50% of those sales will be electric
* Tesla will capture 17% of the EV market which is roughly 7.6 million cars a year
* I'm assuming a new vehicle introduced in 2025 that will capture the truly affordable car market that will be designed in China and released for worldwide consumption (average of $20k per car without autonomous features). This is called Cybercar in the model
* Autonomous vehicle revenue will begin to kick in around the year 2025
* By 2028, roughly 33% of Tesla's new fleet sales (7.6 * .33 = 2.3m) will be generating some level of revenue for the company as autonomous revenue. For this model I'm assuming $7.3k of sales from autonomous per unit on average at 80% margin
* I'm assuming roughly 1% dilution YoY
* I'm assuming ~300k Tesla operated RoboTaxis manufactured yearly by Tesla to cover gaps in coverage in the self driving network
* I'm assuming Tesla Energy to grow to generate similar levels of sales from the Energy business by 2028 as compared to Auto
* i'm assuming a total operating income % of sales of 17.3% on $508b of revenue by 2028
* I'm assuming a 38 P/E multiple on $87b of yearly earnings by 2028

That covers all the big picture stuff as it pertains to what the model takes into account.

The price is obviously eye popping and would give Tesla a market cap of ~3.5 trillion. However, the way I think about this company is drawing a parallel to Apple, which is a Hardware company that has a SaaS (Software as a Service) component bolted on top of it selling units that generate vastly more $ per unit sold, and is entering an entirely disrupted market in the last 100 years that is about as large as it gets on the auto side - and then you add energy on top of it.

Let me know your thoughts.

2020-05-25 08:38:01,$TSLA - some good news out of Europe for EVs,"Bloomberg reported last week the EU is considering incentives for auto makers to “produce and sell clean cars and investment in charging infrastructure for electric vehicles”. Specifically, the EU may 

1) propose a €20bn over next two years EU-wide Purchasing Facility for Clean Vehicles,

2) Clean Automotive Investment Fund of €40-60bn to accelerate investment in zero emission drivetrains,

3) consider doubling investment package to build 2mm public charging and alternative fuel stations by 2025, and

4) zero emission cars would be exempt from VAT.

This last one is likely the most significant because VAT can be anywhere from 17-27% (e.g. 19/20% in Germany/France). So the cost of EV ownership could be significantly improved compared to traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, and could boost EV demand.

These EV incentives could also help Ford, but a growing EV mix vs. ICE would hurt its margins though.",16,0.64
2021-02-01 08:39:38,LMT: A Deep Dive,"Edit 1: More ARKQ buying today (~50k shares). Thank you everyone for the positive feedback and discussion! 

Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF) or TL;DR for the non-military types:

LMT is a good target if you want to literally go to the moon, and my PT is $690.26 in two years (more than 2x from current levels). Justification and some possible trade ideas are listed below, just CTRL-F “Trade Ideas”. I hope you guys enjoy this work and would appreciate any discussion or feedback. I hope to catch you in the comments.

Team,

We interrupt today’s regularly scheduled short squeeze coverage to discuss a traditionally boring stock, LMT (Lockheed Martin), with significant upside potential. To be clear, this is NOT a short squeeze target like many reddit posts are keying on. I hope that this piece sparks discussion, but if you are just looking for short squeeze content, all I have to say is BUY, HOLD, and GODSPEED.

The source of inspiration for me writing this piece is threefold; first, retail investors are winning, and I believe that we will continue to win if we continue to identify opportunities in the market. In my view, the stock market has always been a place for the public to shine a light on areas of innovation that real Americans are excited about and proud to be a part of. Online communities have stolen the loudspeaker from hedge fund managers and returned it to decentralized online democracies that quickly and proudly shift their weight behind ideas they believe in. In GME’s case, it was a blatant smear campaign to destroy a struggling business. I think that we should continue this campaign by identifying opportunities in the market and running with them. It may sound overly idealistic, but if reddit can take on the hedge funds, I non-ironically believe that we can quite literally take good companies researching space technology to the moon. I think LMT may be one of several stocks to help get us there.

Second, a video where the Secretary of State of Massachusetts argues that internet boards are full of a bunch of unsophisticated, thoughtless traders really ticked me off. This piece is designed to show that ‘the little guy’ is ready to get into the weeds, understand business plans, and outpace analysts that think companies like Tesla are overvalued by comparing them to Toyota. That is a big reason that I settled on an old, large, slow growth company to do a deep-dive on, and try my best to show some of the abysmal predictive analysis major ‘research firms’ do on even some of the most heavily covered stocks. LMT is making moves, and the suits on wall street are 10 steps behind. At the time of writing this piece, Analyst Estimates range from 330-460 (what an insane range).

Third, and most importantly, I am in the US military, and I think that it is fun to go deep into the financials of the defense sector. I think that it helps me understand the long-term growth plans of the DoD, and I think that I attack these deep-dives with a perspective that a lot of these finance-from-day-one cats do not understand. Even if no one ever looks at this work, I think that taking the time to write pieces like this makes me a better Soldier, and I will continue to do it in my spare time when I am feeling inspired. I wrote a piece on Raytheon Technologies (Ticker: RTX) 6 months ago, and I think it was well-received. I was most convicted about RTX in the defense sector, but I have since shifted to believing LMT is the leader in the defense space. I am long both, though. If this inspires anyone else to do similar research on other companies, or sparks discussion in the community, that is just a bonus. Special shout-out to the folks that read more than just the TL;DR, but if you do just read the TL;DR, I love you too!

Now let us get into it:

**Leadership**

I generally like to invest in companies that are led by people that seem to have integrity. Jim Taiclet took the reins at LMT in June of last year. While on active duty, he served as a C-141B Starlifter pilot (a retired LMT Aircraft). After getting out he went to work for the American Tower Corporation (Ticker: AMT). His first day at American Tower was September 10, 2001. The following day, AMT lost 13 employees in the World Trade Center attack. He stayed with the company, despite it being decimated by market uncertainty in the wake of 9/11. He was appointed CEO of the very same company in 2004. Over a 16 year tenure as CEO of AMT the company market cap 20x’d. He left his position as CEO of AMT in March of last year, and the stock stagnated since his departure, currently trading at roughly the same market cap as to when he left.

Jim Taiclet was also appointed to be the chairman of the board this week, replacing the previous CEO. Why is it relevant that the CEO came from a massive telecommunications company?

Rightfully, Taiclet’s focus for LMT is bringing military technology into the modern era. He wants LMT to be a first mover in the military 5G space, military application of AI space, the… space space, and the hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) space. These areas are revolutionary for the boomer defense sector. We will discuss this in more detail later when we cover the company’s P/E multiple and why it is absolute nonsense.

It is not a surprise to me that they brought Taiclet on during the pandemic. He led AMT through adversity before, and LMT’s positioning during the pandemic is tremendous relative to the rest of the sector, thanks in large part to some strong strategic moves and good investments by current and past leadership. I think that Taiclet is the right CEO for the job.

In addition to the new CEO, the new Secretary of Defense, Secretary Lloyd Austin, has strong ties to the defense sector. He was formerly a board member for RTX. He is absolutely above reproach, and a true leader of character, but I bring this up not to suggest that he will inappropriately serve in the best interest of defense contractors, but to suggest that he speaks the language of these companies effectively. I do not anticipate that the current administration poses as significant of a risk to the defense sector as many analysts seem to believe. This will be expanded in the headwinds section below.

**SPACE**

Cathie Wood and the ARK Invest team brought a lot of attention to the space sector when the ARKX, The ARK Space Exploration ETF, Form N-1A was officially filed through the SEC. More recently, ARK Invest published their Big Ideas 2021 Annual Report and dedicated an entire 7-page chapter to Orbital Aerospace, a new disruptive innovation platform that the ARK Team is investigating. This may have helped energize wall street to re-look their portfolios and their investments in space technology, but it was certainly not the first catalyst that pushed the defense industry in the direction of winning the *new* space race.

In June 2018, then President Trump announced at the annual National Space Council that “it is not enough to merely have an American presence in space, we must have American dominance in space. So important. Therefore, I am hereby directing the Department of Defense (DoD) and Pentagon to immediately begin the process necessary to establish a Space Force as the sixth branch of the Armed Forces"". Historically, Department of Defense space assets were under the control of the Air Force. By creating a separate branch of service for the United States Space Force (USSF), the DoD would allocate a Chairman of Space Operations on the Joint Chiefs of Staff and clearly define the budget for space operations dedicated directly to the USSF. At present, this budget is funneled from the USAF’s budget. The process was formalized in December of 2019, and the DoD has appropriated \~$15B to the USSF in their first full year of existence according to the FY21 budget.

Among the 77 spacecraft that are controlled by the USSF, 29 of them are Lockheed Martin GPS satellites, 6 of them are Lockheed Martin Space-Based Infrared Systems (SBIRS), and LMT had a hand in creating and/or manufacturing for several of the other USSF efforts. The Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared Missile Warning Satellites (also known as Next-Gen OPIR) were contracted out to both Northrup Grumman (Ticker: NOC) and LMT. LMT’s contract is currently set at $4.9B, NOC’s contract is set at $2.37B.

Tangentially related to the discussion of space is the discussion of hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs). HGVs have exoatmospheric and atmospheric implications, but I think that their technology is extremely important to driving margins down for both space exploration and terrestrial point-to-point travel. LMT is leading the charge for military HGV research. They hold contracts with the Navy, Air Force, and Army to develop HGVs and hypersonic precision fires. The priority for HGV technology accelerated significantly when Russia launched their Avangard HGV in December of 2019. Improving the technology for HGVs is a critical next-step in maintaining US hegemony, but also maintaining leadership in both terrestrial and exoatmospheric travel.

**LARGE SCALE COMBAT OPERATIONS (LSCO)**

The DoD transitioning to Large-Scale Combat Operations (LSCO) as the military’s strategic focus. This is a move away from an emphasis on Counter-Insurgency operations. LSCO requires effective multi-domain operations (MDO), which means effective and integrated strategies regarding land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. To have effective MDO, the DoD is seeking systems that both expand capabilities against peer threats and increase the ability to track enemy units and communicate internally. This requires a modernizing military strategy that relies heavily on air, missile, and sensor modernization. Put simply, the DoD has decided to start preparing for peer or near-peer adversaries (China, Russia, Iran, North Korea) rather than insurgencies. For this reason, I believe that increased Chinese and Russian tensions are, unfortunate as it may be, a boon to the defense industry. This is particularly true in the missiles/fires and space industry, as peer-to-peer conflicts are won by leveraging technological advantages.

There are too many projects to cover in detail, but some important military technologies that LMT is focusing on to support LSCO include directed energy weapons (lasers) to address enemy drone technology, machine learning / artificial intelligence (most applications fall under LMT’s classified budget, but it is easy to imagine the applications of AI in a military context), and 5G to increase battlefield connectivity. These projects are all nested within the DoD’s LSCO strategy, and position LMT as the leader in emergent military tech. NOC is the other major contractor making a heavy push in the modernization direction, but winners win, and I think a better CEO, balance sheet, and larger market cap make LMT the clear winner for aiding the DoD in a transition toward LSCO.

**SECTOR COMPARISON (BACKLOG)**

The discussion of LSCO transitions well into the discussion of defense contractor backlogs. Massive defense contracts are not filled overnight, so examining order backlogs is a relatively reliable way to gauge the interest of the DoD in a defense contractor’s existing or emerging products. For my sector comparison, I am using the top 6 holdings of the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (Ticker: ITA). I hate this ETF, and ETFs like it (DFEN) because of their massively outsized exposure to aerospace, and undersized allocation to companies like LMT. LMT is only 18% smaller than Boeing (Ticker: BA) but is only 30.4% of the exposure of BA (18.46% of the fund is BA, only 5.62% of the fund is LMT). Funds of this category are just BA / RTX hacks. I suggest building your own pie on a site like M1 Finance (although they are implicated in the trade restriction BS… please be advised of that… hoping other brokerages that are above board will offer similar UIs like the pie design… just wanted to be clear there) if you are interested in the defense sector.

The top 6 holdings of ITA are:

Boeing Company (Ticker: BA, MKT CAP $110B) at 18.46%

Raytheon Technologies (Ticker: RTX, MKT CAP $101B) at 17.84%

Lockheed Martin (Ticker: LMT, MKT CAP $90B) at 5.62%

General Dynamics Corporation (Ticker: GD, MKT CAP $42B) 4.78%

Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (Ticker: TDY, MKT CAP $13B) at 4.74%

Northrop Grumman Corporation (Ticker: NOC, MKT CAP $48B) at 4.64%

As a brief aside, please look at the breakdowns of ETFs before buying them. The fact that ITA has more exposure to TDY than NOC and L3Harris is wild. Make sector ETFs balanced how you want them to be balanced and it will be more engaging, and you will likely outperform. I digress.

Backlogs for defense companies can easily be pulled from their quarterly reports. Here are the current backlogs in the same order as before, followed by a percentage of their backlog to their current market cap. All numbers are pulled from January earning reports unless otherwise noted with an \* because they are still pending.

**Boeing Company** backlog (Commercial: $282B, Defense: $61B, Foreign Military Sales (FMS, categorized by BA as ‘Global’): 21B, Total Backlog 364B): BA’s backlog to market cap is a ratio of 3.32, which is strong, but most of that backlog comes from the commercial, not the defense side. Airlines have been getting decimated, I am personally not interested in having much of my backlog exposed to commercial pressures when trying to invest in a defense play. Without commercial exposure, their defense only backlog ratio is .748. This is extremely low. I understand that this does not do BA justice, but I am keying in on defense exposure, and I am left thoroughly unsatisfied by that ratio. Also, we have seen several canceled contracts already on the commercial side.

**Raytheon Technologies** backlog (Defense backlog for all 4 subdivisions: 67.3B): Raytheon only published a defense backlog in this quarter’s report. That is further evidence to me that the commercial aerospace side of the house is getting hammered. They have a relatively week backlog to market cap as well, putting them at a ratio of .664, worse off than the BA defense backlog.

**Lockheed Martin** backlog (Total Backlog: $147B): This backlog blows our first two defense backlogs out of the water with a current market cap to backlog ratio of 1.63.

**General Dynamics Corporation** backlog (Total Backlog: $89.5B, $11.6B is primarily business jets, but it is difficult to determine how much of their aerospace business is commercial): Solid 2.13 ratio, still great 1.85 if you do not consider their aerospace business. The curveball here for me is that GD published a consolidated operating profit of $4.1B including commercial aerospace, whereas LMT published a consolidated operating profit of $9.1B. This makes the LMT ratio of profit/market cap slightly in favor of LMT without accounting for the GD commercial aerospace exposure. This research surprised me; I may like GD more than I originally assumed I would. Still prefer LMT.

**Teledyne Technologies Incorporated** backlog (Found in the earnings transcript, $1.7B): This stock is not quite in the same league as the other major contractors. This is an odd curveball that a lot of the defense ETFs seem to have too much exposure to. They have a weak backlog, but they are a smaller growing company. I am not interested in this at all. It has a backlog ratio of .129.

**Northrop Grumman Corporation** backlog ($81B): Strong numbers here. I see NOC and LMT as the two front-runners in the defense sector. I like LMT more because I like their exposure to AI, 5G, and HGVs more than NOC, but I think this is a great alternative to LMT if you like the defense sector. Has a ratio of 1.69, slightly edging out LMT on this metric. LMT edges out NOC on margins by \~.9%, though, which has significant implications when considering the depth of the LMT backlog.

The winners here are LMT, GD, and NOC. BA is attractive if you think anyone will have enough money to buy new planes. BA and RTX are both getting hammered by commercial aerospace exposure right now and are much more positioned as recovery plays. That said, LMT and NOC both make money now, and will regardless of the impact of the pandemic. LMT is growing at a slightly faster rate than NOC. Both are profit machines, but I like LMT’s product portfolio and leadership a lot more.

**FREE CASH FLOW**

Despite the pandemic, LMT had the free cash flow to be able to pay a $2.60 per share dividend. This maintains their \~3% yearly dividend rate. They had a free cash flow of $6.4B. They spent $3.9 of that in share repurchases and dividend payouts. That leaves 40% of that cash to continue to strengthen one of the most stalwart balance sheets outside of big tech on the street. Having this free cash flow allowed them to purchase Aerojet Rocketdyne for $4.4B in December. They seem flexible and willing to expand and take advantage of their relative position during the pandemic. This is a stock that has little downside risk and significant upside potential. It is always reassuring to me to know that at the end of the day, a company is using its profit to continue to grow.

**HEADWINDS**

**New Administration** – This is more of an unknown than a headwind. The Obama Administration was not light on military spending, and the newly appointed SecDef is unlikely to shy away from modernizing the force. Military defense budgets may get lost in the political shuffle, but nothing right now suggests that defense budgets are on the chopping block.

**Macroeconomic pressure** – The markets are tumultuous in the wake of GME. Hedgies are shaking in their boots, and scared money weighed on markets the past week. If scared money continues to exert pressure on the broader equity markets, all boomer stocks are likely weighed down by slumping markets.

**Non-meme Status** – The stocks that are impervious to macroeconomic pressures in the above paragraph are the stonks that we, the people, have decided to support. From GME to IPOE, there is a slew of stonks that are watching and laughing from the green zone as the broader markets slip deeper into the red zone. Unless sentiment about LMT changes, I see no evidence that LMT will remain unaffected by a broader economic downturn (despite showing growth YoY during a pandemic).

**TAILWINDS**

**Aerojet Rocketdyne to the Moon** – Cathie Wood opened up a $39mil position in LMT a few weeks ago, and this was near the announcement of ARKX. The big ideas 2021 article focuses heavily on satellite technology, deep learning, and HGVs. I think that the AR acquisition suggests that vertical integration is a priority for LMT. They even fielded a question in their earnings call about whether they were concerned about being perceived as a monopoly. Their answer was spot on—the USFG and DoD have a vested interest in the success of defense companies. Why would they discourage a defense contractor from vertical integration to optimize margins?

**International Tensions** – SolarWinds has escalated US-Russia tensions. President Biden wants to look tough on China. LSCO is a DoD-wide priority.

**5G.Mil** – We still do not have a lot of fidelity on what this looks like, but the military would benefit in a lot of ways if we had world-wide access to the rapid transfer of encrypted data. Many units still rely on Vietnam-era technology signal technology with abysmal data rates. There are a lot of implications if the code can be cracked to win a DoD 5G contract.

**TRADE IDEAS**

**Price Target:** LMT is currently at a P/E of \~14. Verizon has roughly the same. LMT’s 5-year P/E ratio average is \~17. NOC is currently at a P/E of \~20. TSLA has a P/E Ratio of 1339 (disappointingly not 1337). P/E is a useless metric because no one seems to care about it. My point is that LMT makes a lot of money, and other companies that are valued at much higher multiples do not make any money at all. LMT’s P/E ratio is that of a boomer stock that has no growth potential. LMT’s P/E is exactly in line with the Aerospace and Defense Industry P/E ratio standard. LMT’s new CEO is pushing the industry in a new direction. I will arbitrarily choose a P/E ratio of 30, because it is half of the software industry average, and it is a nice round number. Plus, stock values are speculative and nonsense anyway.

Share price today: $321.82

Share price based on LMT average 5-year P/E: $384.08 (I see this as a short term PT, reversion to the mean)

Share price with a P/E of 30: $690.26

**Buy and Hold:** Simple. Doesn’t take much thought. Come back in a year or two and be happy with your tendies (and a few dividends to boot).

**LEAPS Call Debit Spread (Based on last trade prices):** Buy $375 C 20 JAN 23 for $26.5, Sell $450 C 20 JAN 23 for $12. Total Cost $14.5 for a spread width of $75. Max gain 517% per spread. Higher risk strategy.

**LEAPS**: Buy $500 C 20 JAN 23 for $7.20. Very high-risk strat. If the price target is hit within two years, these would be in the money $183 per contract for a gain of 2500%. This is the casino strat.

Which companies do you think are the most overvalued and why? Please take into consideration future growth as well as financial metrics.",62,0.91
2020-12-12 04:59:13,The big problem with this and other 'big' subreddits - Popular stocks and funds.,"This will probably be downvoted because it goes against the grain of popular thought here.

The big problem with this subreddit and why you really shouldn't listen to anything here if you are new and naïve to investing is the constant jumping on bandwagons.

The reason why 90% of investors simply do not beat the market indexes is due to jumping on popular stocks and funds after they have been hyped up to stupid price levels.

Here are some examples:- Tesla- Nio- Ark funds

The reason I put Ark in their is because retail investors keep pumping ark up on every single subreddit every day. Here's the fact: It's performed very well *recently* in a 10 year bull market. It has yet to prove itself long term and investing is all about long term.

Tesla and nio are simply in EV bubbles, the EV space is similar to where the dot com was in 2000. It doesn't matter how good a company is if you are buying it for way over it's intrinsic value.

Peter lynch mentioned this in his book. Retail investors constantly switch to the best performing funds in recent years. **These funds then lagg behind the market index. Probably due to their holdings becoming overvalued compared to fundamentals.**

A lot of you guys here need to understand that. Also, just because I am a bear on these stocks/funds doesn't mean I am going to short them because that's timing the market.

Edit: It seems a lot of people agree with me here. So I created a new subreddit for proper analysis of undervalued and unloved stocks using data & numbers: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kc9xbz/irobot\_a\_great\_company\_undervalued\_by\_43/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kc9xbz/irobot_a_great_company_undervalued_by_43/)",877,0.81

Not only that, but Tencent (The Microsoft/Facebook of China) also owns a rather large percentage of NIO shares as well.

Right now the largest obstacle is getting more charging stations installed in China, which obviously can be easily remedied with time. After that, the second largest obstacle is price point. 

As someone who is Chinese and now living in the USA, when I was last in China 4 years ago, EV was just starting to get popular. Especially since that in Guangzhou, Shanghai, and other provinces, you need to win a lottery in order to get license plates for your car- However if it is a Hybrid or EV, you get your license plates right away. Many of my friends would buy EV for this reason alone. 

As of now, Tesla is very popular in China, however, once better Chinese alternative starts to bear fruit, NIO is very likely to be the car that every Chinese citizen will be required to have when the government  starts to mandate “EV only” days. 


Just doing some DD and thought I’d share. I welcome those with negative and bearish outlooks on NIO (with sources) so I may further research your input. Thanks!

2020-05-28 09:21:46,"$TSLA - Goldman sees price cut as a ""modest negative""","Tesla's website showed price reductions for multiple models as of May 26, 2020. It reduced the starting price for a base Model 3 by $2k or 5% to about $38k, and reduced the price for both the Long Range Plus and Performance Model S/X by $5k or 5-6%. Tesla made no change to the Model Y price.

Tesla said in late April it would reduce price of its standard range Model 3 in China so keep its eligibility for government incentives, and also previously said it would likely reduce prices more broadly as costs fell. However, Tesla didn't specifically mention a near-term price reduction pending for the US market. The street had been modelling ASP reductions more due to mix shift than outright price reductions.

Goldman believes the recent price reductions may be in response to: 1) more aggressive incentives in the light vehicle market more broadly (industry incentives in April were up more than 25% y/y to \~$4.3K per vehicle according to Autodata), 2) improved cost for Tesla, and/or 3) due to weaker end demand.",3,0.67
2021-02-01 13:04:26,"New to investing; trying to make sense of Tesla, and general question about P/E","Hi all,

I'm fairly new to investing. I'm reading some recommended materials; reading A Random Walk Through Wall Street and listening to The Intelligent Investor. I've started trying to read through some earnings reports to learn a bit about the space and how to do my own research.

Some stocks of interest to me are the auto stocks; Toyota and Tesla to be precise.

My understanding is that the P/E is the price over earnings. This number doesn't seem to be handed out per stock. Some seem to automatically calculate it? How is this done? For instance if I google ""Tesla stock"" I get the P/E value of 1318. 

If I google ATT (T) I don't get a P/E value, which I assume means I need to calculate it myself from their earnings reports?

Also, playing with the numbers and trying to figure out how Tesla (a $730B market cap company) stands up next to Toyota (A $227B market cap company) I came up with the following:

    $835 / earnings = 1318.42
    earnings = $835/1318, which would be $0.63 per share (TSLA)

This is interesting to me. Because if we do the same for Toyota:

    $140.49 / earnings = 14.56
    earnings = $140.49 / 14.56 = $9.65 earnings per share (TM)

More interestingly, if I try and apply the PE of TSLA to Toyota, I get the following:

    1318 = price / $9.65 earnings per share
    1318 * $9.65 = price
    price = $12718.7

This would bring Toyota's market cap to $20.6T, which I think we probably all agree would be ridiculous?

The more interesting thing is I took Toyota's P/E and applied it to TSLA

    14.56 = price / $0.63 earnings per share
    price = $9.17

This would bring Tesla's market cap to $8.7B if my math is right. 

I guess the point of my post is to ask, what gives? Are PE values in excess of 1000 for large-cap companies ever justified? Speculatively, is this sustainable? Who is this value coming from? 

I'm far enough in the books I mentioned to understand that growth is an important part of the equation when valuing a company, but I'm really trying to make sense of this. In general everything in my logical being tells me Tesla's stock is way, way overvalued, but everything in my gut is telling me ""It doesn't matter"" and that it's going to continue rocketing, because when I'm out on the road, I see Teslas. My coworker making $70k a year? Tesla Model 3 Driver. My boss making a few hundred thousand a year (I'm a software engineer)? Tesla Model S Driver. My wife making a few hundred thousand a year? Tesla Model X driver. 

Toyota on the other hand has a lot more market share on overall cars. More people objectively drive Toyotas at the time of this posting. Even though Tesla's are becoming more common, and they seem to be ""affordable"" if you go with a Model 3, there are more Prius on the road at this point, I believe.

Some general questions:

* I have felt like I missed the bag on TSLA a few times. At what point does the market stop tolerating this? Isn't the idea on a growth stock that eventually the P/E will balance out? It doesn't feel like that will ever be the case on Tesla. Does this mean the future of a ""successful"" TSLA would eventually see a Tesla valued at a few trillion with a <= 100 P/E ratio (which I still feel is high)?
* ""Who"" are the investors who have propelled Tesla as such? Most people I talk to about Tesla in general talk about how they can't afford to buy stocks at $300+ a share. Most individuals I know go the Random Walk route and invest in the S&P, which I suppose ""indirectly"" invests into TSLA. I suppose I mean to ask, are these primarily retail investors, or hedge funds?
* Are there any previous Tesla's in history I'm missing? A Random Walk brings up the South Sea Company, and the Tulip Bulb Craze. I'm only 33, so I'm a bit curious if there's been anything like this before in that: Tesla IS successful, and it trades very high. Has anything in this situation ""failed"" before?

Pardon my ignorance on these topics. I am genuinely trying to learn some of the psychology behind this and would greatly appreciate others' 2 cents on the topic. I know Tesla as a stock is probably a controversial topic, so I tried to provide as much ""math"" as I could to back up what I'm saying. Also, if I'm wrong, or not seeing the overall picture, please enlighten me. I'm here to learn.",88,0.9

2021-01-14 12:33:12,Anyone here buy and hold the most hyped stocks on Reddit from 3-5 years ago? How has that turned out?,"So far I'm going with Jeff Bezos' investing philosophy he outlined in one of his interviews. To just pick a bunch of high risk, high reward long term opportunities, and invest in all of them. If any one or multiple of them pan out, then it'll easily make up for the losers.

So far I've decided to just completely ignored index funds. Instead I'm just DCAing into whatever I find has huge long term potential based off of what reddit, youtube, motley fool or ARK has hyped up. 80% of my portfolio is in BTC, ETH, TSLA, SQ, LMND, DKNG, uranium stocks, and ARK ETFs.  I'm planning on adding solar and marijuana ETFs.

I've also decided not to sell a single stock no matter what happens, until I have enough to just put everything on VT/VTI and live off of that.

Has anyone else pursued this strategy for the past 4-5 years? If so how did it pan out? When I look at old posts from 2-3 years ago it seems that AMD, MSFT and NVDA were the ones that were hyped up. But I can't really tell because I'm only looking at what was most upvoted and using search terms like ""what are your top picks for the long term"".",327,0.92

I have dealt with mkts internationally.. Let me tell you what I see here vs abroad and how I would arrive at a decision on TSLA.. Also trying to help you analyze the psyo aspect which we rarely do : 

1. I cannot imagine companies like TSLA  will be born easily out side the US.. Just something in the air here that makes it possible. I come from a high growth emerging mkt and nothing similar happens there.. Atleast I havent seen in recent times. So, how do you put a val on a high growth company like TSLA? 
2. Have  you guys actually driven a tesla car prior buying stock? I have driven the S, 3, X several times and awed always by how someone can built something this good and sexy.....Can you make a list of top 3 technologies that TSLA cars have revolutionized? Let me help a bit here : Battery, aerodynamics dynamics, fluid dynamics, battery management...................................... many more . How do you value this? 
3. Everyone keeps saying Elon is manipulating the finances.. Do you know he has in dept understanding of finance, how it works.. He built Paypal / x..  So I am sure he will think a lot before letting the company go under
4. How many CEOs are as agile and aggressive with technology and growth as Elon? How do you bake that in? 

So, do a bit of pondering and arrive at a decision based on above .. And for heavens sake stop listening to the analyst.. they roll according to the wind",0,0.17

2020-05-07 03:02:31,Where does TSLA stock value come from?,"I'm sorry if this sounds very dumb, and it probably is.

I am owner of TSLA stock, but one day i started thinking, and i realized that Tesla never has paid dividents. After looking into it they dont plan to do so in the "" foreseeable future"". 

That leaves me with a question, where does the price of Tesla stock come from? A stock that pays dividents has value because if you hold the stock when there is a divident payout you earn money. But holding a stock that doesn't pay dividents earns you no money. This is where Tesla comes in. I get that Tesla can be worth more than GM because in the future Tesla will sell more cars, but if you hold GM stock for a year you will have gotten multiple divident payouts,  but if you have held Tesla stock for a year you wouldn't have gotten a cent (other than the increase in stock value). Considering you make money holding GM stock and you don't with Tesla stock i don't really get why Tesla stock is more expensive than GM stock. Can somebody please explain?

2021-02-22 07:57:58,NVDA ER and ARK Invest point to more upside for NVIDIA,"Nvidia  reports earnings for FY21 Wednesday the 24th.  Analysts are expecting  revenue of $4.8B and EPS of $2.80.   My expectation is closer to  $5.1-$5.2B and EPS and $3+ for the Quarter.  Nvidia has topped revenue  estimates 10 of the last 12 quarters and beat profit estimates in 11 of  the last 12.   Demand remains high and the company has indicated their  gaming segment is already sold out through Q1.

The  blog below has an interesting take on the overlap of these two  companies.    It describes how NVIDIA’s technology covers every single  point in ARK Invest’s 2021 “Big Ideas” presentation.   I really doubt  there is another “disruptively innovating” company making such an impact  against their ""big ideas.""   Certainly ARK’s #1 holding TSLA, isn’t  anywhere near significant to their future as NVDA, let alone the others  rounding out their top 5: Square, Teledoc, Roku or Baidu.

The  mysterious part is NVDA is one of ARK’s smaller holdings.   All NVDA  shares in the three ARK funds they’re held in make up only 0.5% of all  assets in ARK’s actively managed funds.   Counter intuitive.

ARK  has started buying NVDA more prominently in late Dec.   With positive  earnings and a big fund acquiring looks like there could be plenty of  upside in NVDA.

## A frenzy from online traders is sending shares of some companies soaring

On Reddit forums, ordinary investors are swapping stock tips. 

It isn’t just GameStop.

But GameStop Corp. is far from alone in going vertical this year.

Everything from a hydrogen battery maker to a struggling movie-theater chain have rocketed in the past few weeks. Behind the swings, many see ordinary investors, stuck at home in the pandemic, swapping tips and hatching trading strategies on online forums like Reddit’s WallStreetBets—[often buying things Wall Street has bet against](https://www.wsj.com/articles/short-bets-pummel-hot-hedge-fund-melvin-capital-11611349217?mod=article_inline).

Security software and service provider BlackBerry is another stock with a notable short position finding support online from individual investors.

To: Everybody

As of yesterday, we had over 50,000 net new orders for this quarter. Based on current trends, we have a good chance of exceeding the record 90,700 deliveries of Q4 last year and making this the highest deliveries/sales quarter in Tesla history!

In order to achieve this, we need sustained output of 1,000 Model 3’s per day. Almost all parts of the Model 3 production system have exceeded 1000 units on multiple days (congratulations!!) and we’ve averaged about 900/day this week, so we’re only about 10% away from 7000/week.

2021-02-08 18:00:42,21 Years Old - 35K to 126K EOY MISSION,"***INTRODUCTION***

I have never been exposed to the markets until quarantine of last November. I had taken economics back in high school and paper traded, but I had never taken it seriously until now. Now, I see the power of investing and want to tackle the market with a larger capital with the goal of gaining 1% daily. From what I've heard, growing 1% daily is not as easy as it seems, but I feel that with the recent consistent growth of the market, now is a better time than any other. With my 35K, I will work to grow it into a six figure account in one year.

&#x200B;

***THE MATH***

1% a day of initial 35K totals to $350/day

$350/day x 5 days ≈ $1750/week

$1750/week x 52 weeks ≈ $91,000 EOY

Total capital EOY: 35K + 91K ≈ $126K

&#x200B;

***THE STRATEGY***

Diversify investments throughout fundamentally good stocks and ride the trains on hyped stocks from time to time. Additionally, pay attention to growing sectors such as EV.

2020-12-06 15:31:38,Stop looking for advice,"In 1997 there was a study conducted by Duke University[1], that if you followed the recommendation of the best 10% of all market-timing newsletters, you would have earned a 12.6% annualized return from 1991 through 1995.

But if you ignored them and just held your positions, you would have earned 16.4%.

It's worth adding that the operation costs weren't included in that equation, as well as capital gain taxes.

My biggest problem when it comes to investing is trying to find that one gold advice, that would help me make 500% returns. On Reddit there's plenty of TSLA yay and nay sayers, AMZN fanatics and opponents, AAPL fan boys and haters who will try to convince everyone around why their opinion is the most valid and accurate. 

Fuck 'em. Do your own research. Look at the company earning reports. Look at the political climate and try to deduce how the company may react to it. Commit and don't look back. 

Sure, it's good to see what's new once in a while, learn what other people think. But basing your financial moves on other people, even if it's Warren Buffet will make you lose money in the long term.

I read through most of the comments. Good insight from many. Thank you to those of you who had it in your heart to extend your kindness to your reddit comments and opted to share your opinions without being unnecessarily rude or sarcastic (I’m passionate about people not being assholes in person or on the internet, sue me). Seriously, there was some TOP-NOTCH insight in that thread. Thanks!



Anyway, many thoughtful comments alluded to the “obvious bubble we’re in that’ll inevitably come crashing down and be a rude awakening for immature traders like OP.” 


Fair enough. I’m listening. How does a “responsible” investor prepare for this? At the very least I want to educate myself on all angles. 


Go mostly cash and wait for the crash? (What if the crash isn’t for 15 more years though). Stay the course and DCA the index each month, and when she crashes double down and buy more because the market ALWAYS goes up over time? (JL Collins preaches this). Do a hybrid of these? But a bunch of TSLA calls tomorrow to get rich before the crash can happen? /s  Something else?

2020-03-31 09:32:35,$TSLA: street likely to shrug off weak Q1 later this week,"Expectations into Q1 results later this week appear sufficiently realistic. Deliveries will undoubtedly be soft, but I think the Street will shrug it off, and look to production and deliveries recovery in 2H after the COVID-19 disruptions.

With the Fremont plant shutdown, Reno plant at 25% capacity, and New York facility now making ventilators, China will be the primary source of revenue for Q2. Analyst checks indicate \~4k vehicles delivered in China during Feb, and \~3k vehicle/week production rate coming out of Q1.

Given the current environment, Q2 revenue from outside China will mainly consist of vehicles already in transit or waiting for delivery (so not much). Street also largely assumes no revenue from ventilator production in NY. Medtronic PB-980 ventilators retail for $32-48k each, so TSLA technically could realize $50-150m of revenue depending on how much/when they start producing.",2,0.58

What I mean is there are people who carefully form some sort of thesis or in depth review on potential plays that have absolutely helped me grow my portfolio. Anyways so I came across two posts about $VALE and found the research to be incredibly informative and was curious what more people think about this company. Some things to highlight from these posts are how $VALE is the number 1 producer in nickel and they have many production facilities in high volume nickel areas from around the world. I also found it interesting how EVs use a TON of nickel. Shouldn’t this be a no brainer play with the shift of EV from around the world? Nickel is used for the battery found within these EVs. I also think it’s quite interesting how Nickel has been on a bull run ever since the start of the pandemic back in early 2020.

TSLA: Overall been a really big part of EV market and with the addition of the S&P 500 a while ago I have no reason to believe that they will not be part of the EV market still in the next 5-10+ years as the EV revolution will happen and TSLA will be there

NIO: Chinese stock and overall really good models and since they have batteries it will be even bigger in China as they need more cars and owning a Tesla which you  have to charge is not convenient as majority of people who live in China live in apartments

GM: This is a very long term plan but with the vision of trying to turn every car model into a EV model they will help tremendously with the whole EV revolution. The traditionally American SUV or Truck will be provided by GM car's not Tesla as we saw with the cybertruck 

WKHS: They have partnerships and probably will have more with other companies and providing them with EV vehicles and overall a really good long term investment I believe so

2020-04-14 10:28:22,COVID-19 provides $TSLA more time to extend its lead,"Tesla is currently leading in key areas of the auto industry's future (i.e. electrification and software). But some of the biggest long-term concerns for Tesla have been growing competition from bigger better-capitalized players who have begun to embrace EVs, as well as Telsa's lack of scale vs. legacy OEMs.

COVID-19 has arguably forced many of these legacy automakers to delay their long-term investments in EVs, and focus on survival and mitigate damage in the near term. Even before the pandemic, the legacy OEMs faced a steep climb in the transition, because EVs were very dilutive to their margins.

So the pandemic has effectively bought Tesla more time to extend its lead and ramp up supply in the EV market. Nonetheless, the stock's rapid recovery combined with the near term risks to both demand/supply makes one wonder whether there might be a better entry point ahead.",0,0.4

>Funds that mimic the benchmark are set to buy more than $70 billion of the carmaker’s shares and dump an equal amount of stock in existing members, producing intense selling pressure that could lead to dislocations, warned Greg Sutton, head of portfolio trading at Citadel Securities, one of the most active traders of U.S. stocks.

>The potential funding stress is one factor that had prompted the index’s overseers to consider implementing the addition in two tranches. After consulting with the financial community, S&P Dow Jones Indices decided that Tesla will join the traditional way: in one shot, before markets open on Monday. The danger is that trading in many stocks may not be active enough to absorb the sudden deluge of supply.

>“Adding it all at once creates more stock that needs to be sold for the funding trade, which potentially creates more impact -- especially in less-liquid components of the S&P 500,” Sutton said by phone. “The market can digest it, but there is the potential for liquidity impact.”

>While S&P 500 members get shuffled frequently, Tesla’s enormous size adds an unusual layer of uncertainty this time. Boasting a market capitalization of more than $600 billion, Elon Musk’s company is joining as the sixth-largest company in the index. Since the stock it’s replacing -- Apartment Investment and Management Co. -- is only a tiny fraction of Tesla’s size, all other constituents are at risk of feeling the pinch.

/

>To be sure, mammoth additions like this have happened before. Tesla is the biggest entrant by market value in history. However, when measured as a percentage of the S&P 500, its weighting is similar to Berkshire Hathaway’s in 2010, when Warren Buffett’s firm was picked to join, data compiled by Sanford C. Bernstein showed. Yet with passive investing now accounting for roughly half of equity funds, up from 30% a decade ago, the funding requirement this time will be much higher, warned analysts including Toni Sacconaghi and Ann Larson.

>Since S&P Dow Jones announced the news of Tesla’s addition on Nov. 16, the stock has rallied more than 60%. Over the stretch, about 52 million shares changed hands each day on average, 77% more than the previous month. During the past decade, the 10 biggest new entrants climbed an average 10% from the announcement until the actual inclusion, Bernstein’s analysis showed.

>Money managers may have already started adjusting portfolios in anticipation of the changes, with Tesla’s share offering earlier this month providing an opportunity to build positions. Some may opt to carry out part of the trade in the days leading up to the event, leaving some residual amount to work out around Friday’s close. To minimize tracking errors, or deviation from the benchmark, some may choose to use market-on-close orders or turn to options to help performance.

2021-01-25 10:23:25,AI could be front-running WallStreetBets,"There is an ETF that makes trades based on artificial intelligence (ticker: AIEQ). The AI combs through mountains of data (expressly including social media and regular news reporting). When I heard about it, I was originally dubious about its ability to beat a relatively efficient market based on searching through this dataset, but I was curious. So I bought a little bit when it debuted, and it didn't do much of anything, and indeed kinda underperformed so I lost patience and sold it. But I remember an AI podcast I heard that talked about machine learning and how early on (with Chess, or Go, or other tests), humans would beat the AI easily. But then over time, AI progressively learned and then became unbeatable. So I took a flyer and bought back into AIEQ in early November and continued to leg into the position, and it continues to do well. I ran a three month chart vs. SPY and Vanguard's Total Stock Index. It is beating both handily. (This is true on longer time periods also, but I didn't own it before November). Moreover, the outperformance seems to be accelerating, which could mean the AI is learning and improving as it goes.

That outperformance raised my eyebrows, and I was surprised that this dataset had in fact yielded actionable alpha. Then I heard about wallstreetbets. And then I made the connection - AIEQ may be outperforming because it is reading all the Reddit trade discussion, and is following or perhaps even front-running those trades. If you look at AIEQ's top portfolio positions, they are full of Reddit faves like TSLA, ENPH, SPWR, AMD, ROKU, ETSY, SQ, MRNA, ZS, CRWD, PLUG, etc. I don't know if my theory is correct (the AI trading methodology is a black box), but it's certainly food for thought.",51,0.82

1. Conservatively, discount the value of solar and battery sales. These are growth businesses but market size is not necessarily huge/exists at the whim of subsidies. Only consider the vehicle business, which is where the more certain growth is.
2. Treat it as if it's an ordinary car company. This conservative strategy requires dismissing the hype about potential tangential business lines like autonomous software licensing, which is one of Ark's big bull points.
3. Value it as if it will mature selling about 6 million cars per year. This is based on the fact that it has shown a growing ability to displace low-priced IC vehicles like the Corolla and Accord, and over time can take a hefty chunk of that market share. Sales could exceed 6 million if only supply were there, but right now the pace of production capacity growth will limit the company to 6 million vehicles per year by about 2030. Any production growth faster than that is optimistic and  assumes an ability to pick up the pace of factory openings faster than it has historically been able to. Fremont was a preexisting factory, Shanghai took a year and a half, Berlin will take at least a year, semi/cyber site has not been announced yet. Basically, Tesla has shown it can break ground on about 1 factory per year but hasn't proven it can do so faster than that.
4. Median car company enterprise value per vehicle sold is about $27,300. Assuming similar value, 6 million vehicle sales per year puts enterprise value about $163.8 billion, which accounting for debt and cash places the equity price not far from current levels in $800-$900 range.
5. Requiring a solid 30% cushion against this valuation strategy places a decent entry target at $630.

Note that this does NOT mean it's a short here at $830ish. It means this is near fair value, but you should require a return and not invest AT fair value, hence only buying at a more attractive $6 handle.

2020-04-29 10:21:39,$TSLA: some stats out of China autos recovering from COVID-19,"Analysts at Needham held an Expert Call on Monday which provided some interesting stats out of China and outlook for the global auto industry recovering from COVID-19.

1. In China, 2020 light vehicle production is projected to decline 5% to 12.5% y/y, according to rating agencies and industry sources. However, the auto market there is recovering, with OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers returning to pre-pandemic levels. By end of March, auto plants in China are operating at 97% capacity vs. 60% in February.
2. On the demand side, country-wide return-to-work appears to be strengthening consumer confidence and demand for vehicles. Adding to that demand are federal + regional stimulus programs for electric vehicles. Multiple Chinese cities have also relaxed restrictions on license plates for EVs (such restrictions have been used as a measure to manage congestion). However, total units are expected to still be below 2019 and 2018.
3. Behavioral wise, Chinese consumers have shifted more towards private vehicles to avoid shared vehicles (benefit to auto demand), but they're also leaving their homes less and have grown more accustomed to delivery (headwind to auto demand).
4. $TSLA has been by far the leader in China's EV market, selling 12k Model 3 alone in March, well ahead of second place BYD (sold 5k EVs), BAIC (4.5k), and BMW 5 Series PHEV and Ford Escape PHEV lagging behind (under 3k). Including both luxury EVs and non-EVs, Tesla was the 2nd best selling in the country after Mercedes C-Class, but the clear leader in Tier 1 cities (Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen). Chinese consumers also have a tendency to discount Chinese brands vs. global brands.
5. Caution against using China as a benchmark for recovery timeline in EU/US. China was able to flatten the curve and recover in 4-6 weeks due to its integrated coding system that identifies every person that needs to be quarantined based on their mobility patterns. Such an invasive surveillance system is not possible in EU/US. EU is past the 6-8 week mark and there's yet to be a recovery.
6. According to OICA, plant closures could cost US auto makers at least 900k auto sales in 2020, and global light vehicle production may be down as much as 20%.",2,0.75

2021-02-09 05:39:52,Tesla’s made more money in FCF rather than OCF?,"I Hi there, I’m a newb trying to understand how Tesla makes their income.

I just read Tesla IR Report for Q4 2020 and saw that Q4-2020 Tesla have Net Income of 296 Million USD (OCF / Cashflows From Operating Activities).While Proceeds from issuances of common stock in public offerings, net issuance cost is 4987 Million USD (FCF / Cashflow From Financing Activities).

Does this tell us that Tesla is actually made more money from selling stock issuance/right-share rather than operating profit? And i’ve also see an upward trend(2020 splits normalized) that Tesla’s share count & cashflow from issuance of common stocks (FCF) increasing YoY since 2017 — 2016-ish. I dont have any problem with stock issuance because its up to their management to decide whats best , but does this means Tesla actually raised more money selling shares rather than cars?

Feel free to correct me if im wrong or missed something.

2020-02-06 09:51:03,Tsla options and an interesting background story,"TSLA options

This is officially my first post to reddit. Long time reader, I also watch YouTube videos and don’t have an account so please forgive if my posting etiquette is off. Use to be a casual trader have a degree in economics with specialty in behavioral economics and minor in psychology. Also initially left college in my sophomore year (2010) to move to California and start a dispensary. I was going to McGill university in Montreal for those of you who don’t know of it(most Americans). FYI I am American myself and I’m Canada they call Harvard americas McGill (not bragging personally I still believe college is a tax on lower and middle class). I visited a friend on spring break and this is a time when a gram of weed would get you a night in jail and a misdemeanor and if you are lucky enough to live in Texas or Tennessee and be black either 1-10 in jail and at minimum they’d take your car or house or whatever expensive enclosed space you owned in which they found it or probably planted it. I could not believe what I was seeing when I went to see my friend (LA) and ultimately never returned from spring break. These were also the days when the laws in California were changing so fast that if you got a dispensary license in about 6 months you could sell the license for 10-100x what you paid for it (2k -7k if you used a lawyer or 500$ if you did all the paperwork yourself). I ended up starting the first 24hr delivery dispensary (legal) in California at that time probably the world. Needless to say it was very successful, after about a year I hired someone else to run the day to day and mostly became a semi professional gambler which many of you would consider yourselves. The difference is I was actually gambling in casinos. This is not a story in which I stupidly lose all my money at a craps table although there were some fear and loathing-esque weekends during this time that are noteworthy themselves. Also to note I decided to move with exactly 2$ to my name and my parents cutting me off because I was leaving college, luckily I also owned (or rather rented for free) a spot on my dear friends couch (who would later end up being an employee). Within 6 months I was worth about 50k within 12 I was making that much every week. This is the part where some of you may become disappointed because of all the interesting preamble that sounded like it was going to end in a crazy story where I used 50 lbs of weed to leverage a massive short on some stock because I had 24hrs to pay off the Armenian mafia or they would give me a Chinese haircut. Despite the fact that that did happen (with some minor liberties taken in the description although ones that make it actually less crazy of a story) it’s not what I am here writing about. I ended up starting my dispensary by winning 48k one night at the native casino near LA can’t remember the name but anyone from SoCal knows what it’s called. I was also a casual trader albeit very successful when I took it seriously. My dad is also a doctor so I essentially invested it all on ARNA before the fda approval of their new weight loss drug (at the time) I think it was called belviq. Anyway it was a killer, went from like 5 bucks to like 25 in a couple of days and I was looking good to start my business. Since then I’ve continued to dabble and did a lot of shorting but hated the risk, was unaware of options trading. After reading a couple articles online I started getting into it, fast forward to me studying economics (In which I didn’t learn much I didn’t already know except how to use programs to analyze massive amounts of data to find out trends that mostly my own intuition was good enough to tell me),  but now atleast I’m a “respectable person” in the eyes of my parents and the business world. Ultimately since this is my first post I decided to go big and long with it because I just felt that would be proper and maybe someone would be entertained, and maybe in the future I will divulge the actual crazy shit that happened but wall street bets doesn’t seem like the right thread (?). I just wanted to introduce myself and say, when TSLA hit 964 two days ago how many thousands of wallstreeters and tens of thousands of thousands or hundreds or however many of you redditors that are trading options and know half a twats worth what you’re doing did jizz their pants and buy some puts. Personally I like to gamble only saw it once it had dipped down to 900$ before closing but was trending down already. I figured I’d buy something that had a really short execution period for cheap af at like 895$ and once it dipped to like 865 or something sell but ultimately I knew in my heart as most of u do that it was going to drop to maybe 700 or lower. Didn’t have the liquidity to do what I would have liked but called some of the rich people I know who did and they wanted to jerk me off at 11 am the next morning. The few who missed out were begging for what next. One particular who is a relative of mine and a VP at major software company (think top 3) argued that wouldn’t everyone be buying puts and isn’t that what drove the price up? Wouldn’t it be better to sell options on the tsla shares you own and then if it goes down you made some cash and buy more at the lower price. I’m sure many of you know why that is a much weaker play and has way less upside and at the same time limits your risk way less. When the morning came he and others who didn’t follow thru were dying they missed out and asking me what to do next. I hadn’t looked much but it seemed to be bottoming out at 7 and I assumed put buyers were starting to executing their contracts so I said buy calls near 700 and do it for the shortest period u can find in terms of days. By lunch time it’s at 750$ ofcourse and my suggestion of 10-20 contracts would be betting a nice 80-90k maybe more if u bought the ridiculously short term options. Most of them were able to cash out my relative who is an exec at (insert top software company here) still missed out. He had to go into a meeting and didn’t have enough time to execute and wanted to die as he watched the stock jump 50$ and the imaginary dollars that would have been piling up in his investment account disappearing for the second time in one day for the levels he trades and wanted to buy this would have been around 1m maybe he would have made. After his meeting he messages me “uhh I think I need you to manage part of my portfolio, can you do the options trading for me and manage my short term stocks? I don’t have enough time to watch the market because of meetings etc. and when I see what I’m missing out on I can’t pay attentions during the meetings and it’s fucking up my productivity.” - me : “ well I don’t want to have access to your password etc. and be responsible if some fucked shit happens in your portfolio I don’t want to be blamed. Also if I don’t know how I feel about making you millions and then accepting whatever tip you feel is appropriate. Obviously we could do like a percentage but I’d feel better about starting a separate fund and you can put in whatever you feel comfortable investing and we can see how it goes.

$9B, and it’s still not done???

That means the company has to be at least $180B in size, otherwise SECs 5% ownership rule would kick in(although it could receive special exemption).

Since BRK.B is not done yet, we can assume it’s a very big fish with a very large float, otherwise that stock could likely go vertical due to lack of supply of shares.

There are not many companies that fit this bill, which company could it be?

Some people are thinking it’s TSLA but I am kind of doubtful. In the same time, there's cause for suspicion, as huge TSLA shares have been out of trading action and Buffet himself shot the possibility of investing in TSLA in an Yahoo Finance interview(which gives more flame to the fire, since Buffet has a history of being tight lipped and saying the opposite of what he actually does).

RMO ~ An electric vehicle battery and retrofit company. This is a good entry point after yesterday's drop. If anyone was interested in joining the electric vehicle train but missed the start, now is your chance. This company recently went public via SPAC IPO. It initially jumped but has since settled. I see it taking off again soon. With a small market cap it could potentially be a 10-20 bagger.

Alternative similar company: XL ~ Same deal as above, just more focused on commercial electric vehicle fleet retrofits rather than battery tech. Also recently gone public via SPAC IPO.

The electric vehicle revolution is upon us, and while these aren't pure electric vehicle plays in the TSLA or NIO sense, they still have a lot of potential. There are a ton of existing commercial vehicles that need to be electrified.

2018-08-09 15:15:31,Is Musk getting the Shorts to pay for TSLA going private?,"I think we may be about to witness the greatest financial judo move in recorded history: **Musk will make Tesla private and bury the Shorts, using their own money**. It will not cost him a dime. Detailed explanation below:

Why is this even conceivable? Because Tesla is the most shorted stock ever. There are more shorts to cover than shareholders who would prefer to cash-out at $420.

[Some TSLA data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/tsla/key-statistics/):

* Shares outstanding: 171M 
* Float: 127M shares, of which:
 * Musk: [34M shares](https://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/insiders/musk-elon-831665)
 * Institutionals: 81M shares.

     Almost all of them (above 70M shares) are not prohibited from holding shares in a private company.
 * Other (incl retail investors): 12M shares.


      Note there aren't enough of those to significantly change the picture.

* Short interest: [35M shares](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/tsla/short-interest)

Now let's *assume*: 

* This is real. Elon actually has someone willing to buy out any shareholder who doesn't want to, or cannot, go private, at $420.
* Most institutional investors will chose to remain with the privatized Tesla and not exit at $420.
* The board approves, and it goes to a shareholder vote, with a guaranteed 2/3rd majority of Musk and almost all the top institutionals.

What will happen? 

* You have 35M shorts to cover. Less than 35M shares to do that. Nobody will sell for less than the 420 they know they'll get anyway. Result: [Volkswagen-style short squeeze](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen/short-sellers-make-vw-the-worlds-priciest-firm-idUSTRE49R3I920081028).
* Anybody who wants out can sell during the short squeeze. 
* If the squeeze goes high enough, some shareholders may change their mind and sell anyway. Probably all the shorts will be covered, but significantly north of 420.
* The only shareholders remaining after the squeeze are those who want to take their stocks into the private stage.

Result: There are no shareholders left that need to be bought out at $420. The short squeeze took care of those. Tesla goes private. Cost to Musk: ZERO.

A classic judo move - use your opponent's momentum against them.

I realize the above scenario sounds insane. But the logic is sound. Even if more institutionals want out, the short squeeze will take care of most of them, and the actual cost of privatization will be a small fraction of TSLA's valuation.

If you think this is BS, please explain why. ",227,0.83

If you don't want to become a loser like me listen to your gut and don't be afraid to take risks.,"I got friends that made a fortune on Bitcoin and others on tech stocks like Tesla, Microsoft and Apple.
I remember countless conversations we had, them telling me to invest(I remember clearly that at that time I could have bought around 200 bitcoins) and I just couldn't be bothered ""gambling"" my savings so I had them parked in a bank for a lousy 1.5% interest per year for over 12 years.

Back on January of this year I finally got some courage and decided to invest but chose to put my savings on a diversified ETF portfolio instead of picking single stocks, because I wanted to limit my risk.
In February my portfolio went down around 35% due to the Covid market crash and I got immense pressure from my wife to sell and save as much of our savings as possible before we lose everything. I panicked and caved in, more than half the amount was hers so I couldn't really refuse.

During the following months and for some bizare reason the markets not only recovered from the February-March losses, but they kept making record highs and made many investors rich during a pandemic that killed milions and crippled most countries economies. Not even sure how this was possible if you ask me.

Moral of the story: 
Don't be a fucking loser like me. Don't be scared to take financial risks because you will never make money if you don't. All my investor friends started with a lot less capital than me and ended up rich or well off.

2020-09-27 07:48:03,Take advantage of the EV goldrush by completing the EV Trifecta,"Take advantage of the EV goldrush by completing the EV Trifecta

As you may already know, we are currently in the midst of an EV goldrush. Early adopters, investors, and gamblers will be rewarded for identifying these opportunities and capitalizing on them. 

One way to ensure that you gain enough exposure to capitalize on this this gold rush is by completing the EV Trifecta, which are:

1. EV Manufacturers 
2. Raw materials for batteries
3. EV charging stations

I will go into a bit more detail on each component of the trifecta:

 

1. EV Manufacturers - These are companies that develop and manufacturer EV for the public to new purchase. There is a lot of EV manufacturers that are going public, some of them will be achieve market dominance, while others will dwindle away \*cough\* NKLA. These are some of the EV manufacturers that are available for the public to invest in: TSLA, NIO, XPEV, KNDI, LI, SHLL, PIC, HCA(C), SPA(Q). Currently, TSLA is the market leader in this industry and also have the first mover advantage, and this is clearly reflected in their stock price. All the other EV manufacturers are up and coming and will have lots of run room as EVs become more prevalent in our day to day lives.

2. Raw materials for batteries - The logic here is that as demand for EV increase, so will the demand for the raw materials used to create the batteries for the EVs. Simple economics 101 states that as demand increase and supply decreases, price should increase accordingly. These are the current raw materials companies that have a spotlight on them: LA(C), VAL(E), PLL. PLL is the only raw materials company that have a public contract with TSLA and has been halted for weeks because of this news. PLL will definitely be a hot buy once it unhalts. 

3. EV charging stations - In order for EVs to be come more prominent in our day to day lives, there needs to be a proper infrastructure that will enable that. One of the biggest concerns in regards to EV is range anxiety - drivers don't want to be left stranded if they forget to charge their vehicles overnight at home. Having charging stations that are widely available will help combat this risk. The EV charging station market is relatively untapped, and this market will grow along side the EV market. The key players in the EV Charging station are SBE, BLNK, SPl. SPl had an insane run up last week when they announced their EV initiative, their share price increased over 3000% from $1.50 to over $40 (this was short lived though). BLNK is a mixed bag, there are some complaints in regards to the quality of their charging stations, but hopefully they'll improve over time. SBE is a SPA(C) merger to bring Chargepoint public. Similar to TSLA, Chargepoint is the market leader in the charging station space and also have the first mover advantage. Chargepoint currently has hundred of thousands of charging stations across North America (US and Canada) and is expanding into Europe. Their products can be purchased via their home website or Amazon and have great reviews online. 

By completing the EV Trifecta you'll ensure you have proper exposure to the EV goldrush. I'm sure I missed a few companies, so please feel free to mention them and add any additional details that I might have missed.",894,0.92

A lesson from AMZN...,"Watching a documentary on YouTube “amazon empire: the rise and reign of Jeff bezos” and about 16 minutes in they talk about how early amazon didn’t have any profits and Jeff explained to investors they were building the infrastructure and the foundation for their future growth and their focus is on the long term.

I see an eerily similar situation with Tesla (people criticizing about profits).  Obviously it’s apples to oranges but profit isn’t the only metric to gauge future potential.  


Full disclosure- I’ve only seen critics of tsla profits randomly on yahoo and other random sites.

Counter point- Tesla has much more potential competition and is fighting a mature industry compared to amazon which was showing enormous growth in an infant industry (e- commerce and internet).

As to why tsla went from 300ish to 900ish so quickly, I don’t know.

2020-11-23 14:31:09,I feel some stocks in this market are going crazy. Does anyone agree?,"Hi there,

Hope everyone is doing okay today. I've been watching markets for years and have definitely been in tune with 2020's various twists and turns for investors. I usually conduct several hours of research before even considering investing in a stock. My usual strategy involves sticking with businesses I understand and staying away from investments I feel are clearly overpriced.

In this market, I'm noticing that certain meme stocks are king. Plug Power, Tesla, Jumia Technologies, Nikola (previously), and others have run far away from a level where many investors are comfortable making a purchase. I've also noticed that the returns of several friends and family members are absolutely trouncing the rest of the market. These individuals often conduct less than one hour of research and barely know the P/E, P/S, or business model of the stock they are trading.

Are there risks in these markets? Have we shifted to a new paradigm where everybody should just buy TSLA, PLUG etc. and just coast to retirement in 5 years? If this can continue, surely you would think that pension funds would toss those 2% bonds in the garbage and buy such securities.

Please correct me if I'm wrong on any of the above, I'm curious about people's thoughts here. Thank you and have a great holiday week.",73,0.85

2020-02-05 14:16:02,I am trying to understand relation between volume and stocks. Does my analysis of TSLA stock make any sense?,"I was trying to understand how I can learn about a stable range for a stock based on volume. I am new to the stock markets so please forgive any stupid remarks I make and point them out. 

I was looking at recent Tesla run in past 2 days. Tesla's total market float is about 150m shares. Their volume 2 days ago was 45m and yesterday was 55m shares. Thats a lot of people buying $TSLA stock above $750+ valuation. Elon himself had 19% of total TSLA float and he has never sold a single share, based on that we can ""assume"" that he didn't trade a single share in past 2 days too. (This assumption could definitely be wrong and I won't contest it.) If we believe this assumption, out of 145m total shares, 38m+ stocks were not traded at all. That leaves 110m non-Elon stocks in the market.

Now, 50% of $TSLA stocks are owned by institutions. So about 75m shares. 110m - 75m = 35m stocks. The average retail investor only owns 35m stocks. The total volume traded in last 2 days alone was about 100m stocks. Now I know that the same stock can be traded again and can be counted multiple time in that number. Let's say about 60%, so 60m unique stocks were purchased in the last 2 days when people + institutions bought the stock at $750+.

I guess my question is, considering that, is it not safe to say that 750 is a very, very stable range for TSLA given that not just retail investors but institutions too are locked in at this price? Also, please point out any holes or mad assumptions in my analysis. I am new to investing and have my own biases which I would like to overcome.

Estimates for 2020 deliveries are now in the low-400k's, down by about 100k from pre-pandemic, and well below delivery guidance to ""comfortably exceed"" 500k. Expectations on margins and EPS have also come down substantially for 2020-2021. Seems like the numbers have been largely de-risked for 2020.

TSLA ended 2019 with $5.8bn in cash and subsequently raised $2.3bn in a secondary equity offering. Q1 likely burned through $1bn (seasonally tough quarter for cash flows), but it should still have >$7bn, so ample liquidity to weather this storm.

The bigger question now is how the right side of the ""V"" recovery will look. This will partly depend on whether the US government will step in to help the industry. While the street has priced in auto industry shut down of 1-2 full months, investors are now running scenarios of 6-9 month shutdowns. If such a scenario seems increasingly likely, then there's certainly going to be more downside for TSLA (and $GM, $F).

Fortunately, there is good reason to believe the US government won't let this scenario happen. The auto industry is the largest manufacturing sector in the US, generating more jobs than any other manufacturing sector, indirectly supporting 10-15m jobs in the country. The OEMs and suppliers account for 3% of US GDP.

While the topic of auto stimulus may be a couple of months early because there are obviously more pressing matters for lawmakers during the pandemic, we could start to see headlines on stimulus discussions by early summer. Looking back to the 2008/2009 crisis, there was support for consumers to buy cars (remember Cash for Clunkers?) and support for banks to help finance cars.

Wall Street is bracing for Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ:TSLA) arrival to the S&P 500 Index on Dec. 18.

What Happened: The addition of the California-based automaker is expected to create challenges because of the company's size, $555 billion, and volatility. Tesla's share price jumped 40% right after the S&P 500 announcement on Nov. 16, and the addition comes at a time of pandemic-related volatility, the Wall Street Journal reports. 

Tesla is the biggest company to ever join the index, and it’ll be the sixth largest by market capitalization. 

Elon Musk’s company might put $100 billion “in motion” when added, as funds try to sell other companies’ stock to buy Tesla’s, according to WSJ.

To help ease the potential trading chaos, some Wall Street managers recommend splitting the addition “over two trading days,” something that has never happened before, WSJ notes.

Ben Inker, who manages asset allocation at investment manager GMO believes any unpreparedness might have consequences. “The people who will pay the price if S&P screws up are the investors in passive S&P,” he says.

Why It Matters: Tesla's addition to the S&P 500 also happens the same day the so-called “quadruple witching” takes place. Every last Friday of the quarter marks the day when futures and options expire at the same time, which increases the volume.

This, investors say, might help with the liquidity that day but may also increase market volatility.  ",180,0.94

Immersion Corporation

Price $13.36 Market Cap $359.68M (Monday 1st February)

**Introduction**

Immersion is the world leading innovator of touch feedback technology, also known as haptics. The company provides haptic technology to create immersive and realistic experiences that enhance digital interactions on mobile devices. Immersion's technologies have been adopted in more than 3 billion digital devices that, along with mobile, include automotive, gaming, medical and consumer electronics. 

**Financials** 

Cash in the bank, zero debt 

Net income increased to $2.9M in Q3 2020

Gross margin +99%

31.30% insider ownership

Earnings came in way ahead of expectations with GAAP EPS ($0.11) and non-GAAP EPS ($0.15) both $0.10 better than expected.

Q3 revenue: 74% mobile 12% automotive 14% gaming

Short percentage of float 7.18% 

**Next earnings date; Thursday 5th March 2021.**

*Sourced from income statement and balance sheet - September 30 2020.*

**Why go long?**

The global haptic technology market is expected to grow from USD 2.6 billion in 2021 to USD 4.6 billion by 2026, at a CAGR of 12.0%. Other forecasts suggest it could grow as high at $10B with increasing integration of haptics into consumer devices is the primary factor driving the market growth.

Immersion holds around 3,500 patents in their industry. The [protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersion_v._Sony) of their tech is a key factor in the long term prospect of this stock. IMMR has previously successfully sued both Sony and Microsoft over vibration technology installed in their console controllers.

The September 2020 earnings call highlight forecasted growth through 2021 of 214% largely tied to IMMR’s licensing agreement with Sony for PS5’s. Earnings are obtains per units sold, both on consoles and controllers. PS5 sales are booming with demand outstripping supply, resulting in Sony upping their 2021 sales targets and raising production by 50%.

Of potentially greater long term significance is the rumoured partnership with $TSLA. Tesla have announced they are working on a [new steering column and center console ](https://electrek.co/2020/02/06/tesla-new-steering-wheel-touchscreen-gear-stalk/?source=content_type:react%7Cfirst_level_url:article%7Csection:main_content%7Cbutton:body_link)which will include haptic technology. The reality is IMMR are most likely the only serious candidate. 

IMMR are perfectly portioned with their existing patents to continue to dominate their market, very limited completion and advance patented technology allows for their products to be licensed for greater margin, than traditional development contracts.

**Considerations**

Insiders have been selling most recently William C Market (Director) and Eric Singer (Director). In total $43,296,960.21 worth of shares have been dispositioned over the last 12 months.

**Conclusion** 

Immersion is well positioned to be a great medium to long term buy. Most attractive is its modest market cap suggesting a great upside. The comprehensive catalog of unique intellectual property and high margin licensing strategy is critical in delivering value going forward. Royalties from PS5 sales will likely boost revenue ahead of March’s results. Lastly 5G technology boasting mobile sales and the chance of a huge automotive partnership suggests that there is plenty of value in the company.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co's (GM.N) Super Cruise once again edged Tesla's (TSLA.O) Autopilot in an evaluation of 17 vehicles equipped with active driving assistance systems (ADAS) by Consumer Reports, the testing organization said on Wednesday.

A Tesla Model Y fitted with Autopilot finished ""a distant second,"" the group said, to a Cadillac CT6 equipped with Super Cruise, which GM is rolling out to more than 20 vehicles - including its new Hummer electric pickup truck - over the next three years.

Safety and insurance researchers have frequently warned of the risks of consumers overestimating ADAS systems' abilities, a misconception increased by some automakers calling their products Autopilot, ProPilot or Co-Pilot.

In 2018, the Cadillac CT6 with Super Cruise scored higher than a Tesla Model 3 with Autopilot, in a Consumer Reports test of just four vehicles equipped with ADAS.

In the latest test, conducted this summer on a track and on public roads, the Cadillac scored 69 points out of a possible 100, while the Tesla scored 57. A Lincoln Corsair equipped with Ford Motor Co's (F.N) Co-Pilot 360 system, finished third with 52.

The critical difference in the Super Cruise system is a driver-facing infrared camera to make sure he or she is paying attention to the road and is ready to take over manual control when necessary, said Kelly Funkhouser, head of connected and automated vehicle testing at Consumer Reports.

The group noted that Autopilot can shut off abruptly in some situations, while Super Cruise did a better job of notifying the driver when the system is disengaging.

In recent European safety testing, a Tesla Model 3 with Autopilot placed sixth out of 10 systems, getting high marks for performance and ability to respond to emergencies, but falling short on its ability to maintain a driver’s focus on the road.

2020-10-21 13:18:49,Tesla crushes Q3 Earnings with record profits,"

Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) third-quarter earnings for 2020 saw the electric car maker post $8.771 billion in revenue, beating Wall Street’s expectations. The results, which were discussed at length in an Update Letter, were released after the closing bell on Wednesday, October 21, 2020.

Tesla’s third-quarter was impressive, with the electric car maker producing a total of 145,036 vehicles comprised of 16,992 Model S and Model X and 128,044 Model 3 and Model Y. The company also delivered 139,300 vehicles comprised of 124,100 Model 3 and Model Y, as well as 15,200 Model S and Model X.

Tesla’s strong Q3 results were likely due to the Model Y ramp in the United States and the increasing Model 3 production at Gigafactory Shanghai. With these, expectations were high that Tesla would once more post a profit this third quarter.


The following are the key points in Tesla’s Q3 2020 Update Letter.

REVENUE
Tesla reported a revenue of $8.771 billion for the third quarter, beating Wall Street’s expectations. In comparison, Wall Street expected Tesla’s Q3 2020 revenue at $8.28 billion, as per FactSet consensus. 

EARNINGS
Tesla shareholders saw non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.76 in the third quarter. In comparison, Wall Street expected Tesla to report a gain of $0.57 per share. Estimize’s numbers were a bit more optimistic at $0.65 per share",521,0.92

2020-11-23 05:48:32,The Tesla Bull Case in Brief,"**Disclaimer**

I have no financial position in Tesla at this point in time and no interest in initiating one within the next month.

&#x200B;

# Introduction

There seems to be a strong sentiment among some that Tesla is vastly overvalued, and that the current stock price is completely unrooted in reality. I understand the viewpoint, but don't really share the belief. That's not particularly surprising as I consider myself a Tesla optimist. I decided to present in brief the case for Tesla's valuation as I understand it.

&#x200B;

# Overvalued?

Tesla's current market capitalisation appears to be grossly overvalued, especially when compared to their peers in the automotive sector as [these charts so clearly illustrate](https://preview.redd.it/gdvz8sgmpz061.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=45524ed08b3899febc3fa9b67329569e25a906b9).

In fact, the charts actually understate things as Tesla's market cap currently seats at around $464 billion. You could add another Daimler to the US and EU listed companies and they would still have a lower market capitalisation than Tesla.

This really is the case for Tesla being overvalued: it's automotive revenues is many times it's current market capitalisation. [Per MarketWatch, Tesla's trailing PE is 978.44](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tsla/company-profile?mod=mw_quote_tab), so it's not as if Tesla is especially profitable either.

On a fundamentals basis, Tesla appears to be grossly overvalued.

&#x200B;

# Growth

The above chart doesn't necessarily indicate that Tesla's current market capitalisation is an extremely speculative bubble that could burst soon, but more that Tesla is not valued based on its current financial situation. Tesla is valued as an extreme growth company, and it's growth over the past five years bears this out.

**Revenue**

|Year|Revenue (USD millions)|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2008|15|\-|
|2009|112|646.67|
|2010|117|4.46|
|2011|204|74.36%|
|2012|413|102.45|
|2013|2,013|387.41|
|2014|3,198|58.87|
|2015|4,046|26.52|
|2016|7,000|73.01|
|2017|11,759|67.99|
|2018|21,461|82.51|
|2019|24,578|14.52|

[Source (Macro Trends)](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/revenue)

&#x200B;

To contextualise this, here's Tesla's trailing CAGR:

|Time span|CAGR (%)|
|:-|:-|
|5 years|50.36%|
|7 years|79.27%|
|10 years|71.45%|

Over the last decade, Tesla has demonstrated formidable growth. There's reason to believe that they can continue to show impressive growth (albeit lowered going forward).

The first two quarters of 2020 were battered by a pandemic (Tesla factories faced lockdowns due to the pandemic), and as a result are somewhat of an exception. There were no lockdowns during Q3.

Looking at Tesla's Q3 results, we see that the formidable growth story continues;

||Q3 2019|Q3 2020|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Vehicle Deliveries|97,186|139,593|44|
|Automotive Revenues (USD millions)|5,353|7,611|42|
|Storage Deployed (MW)|477|759|59|
|Solar Deployed|43|57|33|
|Energy Revenue|402|579|44|
|Total Revenue (USD millions)|6,303|8,771|39|

&#x200B;

**Going Forward**

Wall Street seems to expect the growth story to continue. Per Market Insider, here are the consensus analyst estimates for the next five years:

|Year|Revenue (USD Millions)|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2020|30,626|24.61|
|2021|44,937|46.73|
|2022|55,963|24.54|
|2023|79,620|42.27|
|2024|102,526|28.77|

[Source (Markets Insider)](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/tsla-stock)

&#x200B;

I personally think that analyst consensus estimates are significantly underestimating Tesla's growth. In particular their figures for 2020 seem off by $2 billion or more. Analyst estimates for Q3 2020 were off by $495 million, and the estimate of $9,884M for Q4 seems off by around $1,500M (assuming Tesla meets the 180K delivery target) without accounting for the recognition of any deferred revenue. Tesla had $1,258M in deferred revenue at the end of Q3.

This may seem optimistic, but you're welcome to hold me to do this on January 28th 2021.

Despite their (potential) underestimation of Tesla, analysts expect a 5 year CAGR in 2024 of 33%. Tesla is expected to continue to show formidable growth to the end of the decade.

&#x200B;

**Expansion**

Tesla would execute on this formidable growth story through capital expenditure. They will build numerous service centres and gigafactories. The goal is to have giga factories on all 6 economic continents (with some continents having several factories) in order to lower the expenses involved in distributing the cars and to streamline logistics. Currently, Tesla is building two new gigafactories in Berlin and Austin and is currently expanding Giga Shanghai.

An inherent assumption is that the market has the demand to absorb all this extra supply. M[any states have committed to phasing out ICE vehicles](https://preview.redd.it/jpi7br8rpz061.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6524f0cf77a69a52009011eff2160b34c2c1d8e).

[Source (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles#Countries_and_large_jurisdictions)

&#x200B;

Around 13 states have committed to phasing out ICE vehicles on or before 2030. Over the coming decade, [the EV total addressable market is projected to grow to 27 million by 2030](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/electric-vehicle-market-209371461.html#:~:text=The%20Electric%20Vehicles%20Market%20is,is%20from%202019%20to%202030) (at a CAGR of 21%). This again seems a bit too conservative. [EV sales were down in the first half of 2020 (due to the pandemic), but in July sales grew 77% YoY](https://www.ev-volumes.com/). Some states have also pulled forward their timelines for phasing out fossil fuels since the forecast was initially made.

Tesla would face stiff competition going forward, but the total addressable market would grow fast enough to absorb all of Tesla's growth in supply if they can successfully market their vehicles. The risk here is that Tesla would fail to execute not that the total addressable market isn't large enough.

As an optimist, I'm fine betting on Tesla's ability to execute.

&#x200B;

**Access to Capital**

To fund the massive expansion expected of them, Tesla would need to spend a lot on capital expenditure. Fortunately, access to capital is not a problem for Tesla.

* Tesla's cash on hand at the end of Q3 2020 was $14.5 billion.
   * Per [their 10Q filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data//1318605/000156459020047486/tsla-10q_20200930.htm) this is already sufficient to fund their capex needs up to 2023.
* Free cash flow for the quarter was $1,395M.
* Giving their current market capitalisation ($464 billion) and the mandatory demand from index funds on their inclusion ($60 billion), Tesla has an opportunity to raise $10 - $20 billion in a new capital raise.
   * A $20 billion raise would give them enough cash on hand at the end of 2020 to finance their expansion plans for several years going forward.
* Free cash flow is expected to rise going forward:
   * In Q3 there was a 234% increase QoQ and a 276% increase YoY.
   * Tesla has been seeing increased efficiency of capital expenditures.

&#x200B;

# Margins

Another component of the Tesla bull case is that in addition to hyper growth in revenues, Tesla's profit margins would also rise significantly over the next decade. [This is readily apparent if we look at Tesla's past four quarters](https://preview.redd.it/qygtw9twpz061.png?width=1202&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f6950e6e813a92b1743b89fc56ab8247129fd8d).

[Source (Tesla Investor Relations)](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/4E7BR9_TSLA_Q3_2020_Update_P0Q85U.pdf?xseo=&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q3-2020-Update.pdf%22)

&#x200B;

Automotive gross margins have steadily risen from 22.8% a year ago to 25.4% last quarter and seem set to continue their upwards trajectory. Total gross margins have risen from 18.9% to 23.5%. There are good reasons to expect the rise to continue and maybe even accelerate going forward:

* Manufacturing Efficiencies
* Network Services

&#x200B;

**Manufacturing Efficiencies**

As Tesla continues to ramp up production and innovate, they will be able to drive down the manufacturing cost of their vehicles, benefit even further from economies of scale (both in their production and their supply lines as EV demand heats up globally). Tesla's capital expenditure will become even more efficient; they will be able to squeeze out more manufacturing capacity, from the same amount of capital expenditures.

[Tesla's rise in capex efficiency is apparent when you compare their capex expenditure in 2020 (construction of Giga Berlin, Giga Texas, Fremont Model Y ramp, and expansion of Giga Shanghai) to capex expenditure in 2017 (Fremont Model 3 ramp)](https://preview.redd.it/7r2b1vd0qz061.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=2688cee4dc6abdb063a5ee431dc0193792aedc2b).

[Source (Hypercharts)](https://hypercharts.co/tsla)

&#x200B;

[Despite the lower capex in 2020, Tesla is building a lot more cars](https://preview.redd.it/0xw1tgc3qz061.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=21dd52a5121fdee3102afe62cb7aa9a7b3aee89b).

[Source (Statista)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/715421/tesla-quarterly-vehicle-production/)

&#x200B;

In addition to the aforementioned favourable trends, there are concrete reasons to expect Tesla to perform very well on the capex efficiency front over the next decade. A[t Tesla's battery day, Tesla laid out a roadmap to drastic increases in efficiency](https://preview.redd.it/uujqxx1jqz061.png?width=1942&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea32aa9410a4110984fcce8c32a401b260d63124).

[Source (Tesla Investor Relations)](https://tesla-share.thron.com/content/?id=96ea71cf-8fda-4648-a62c-753af436c3b6&pkey=S1dbei4)

&#x200B;

Tesla is forecasting a **69%!!!** increase in capex efficiency in the coming years.

Furthermore, the cost of batteries is forecast to fall by as much as **56%**. Batteries are a significant component of the total cost, and the reduction in the cost of batteries would further improve Tesla's margins.

Aside from batteries, and capex efficiency, Tesla should also be able to drive down the cost of manufacturing other components of their electric cars due to [Wright's Law](https://ark-invest.com/wrights-law/).

While Tesla would pass on some of these cost savings to the consumer, they wouldn't pass on all of them. This is evidenced by Tesla's improved margins in 2020 despite several price cuts.

&#x200B;

**Network Services**

Tesla's network services are included with their automotive revenues, but represent a novel high margin business that isn't part of the traditional automotive playbook. Using Tesla's fleet as the platform, Tesla can sell software products, subscriptions and other services to their customers. The recurring revenue of subscriptions in particular is a cause for optimism (especially given the potential high margins).

Tesla's existing products:

* Software
   * Full Self Driving: $10,000
   * Enhanced Autopilot: $4,000
      * This isn't currently available was previously an option
   * Acceleration Boosts
      * Model 3: $2,000
      * Model Y: $2,000
* Subscriptions
   * Premium Connectivity: $10/month
   * Full Self Driving: ???
      * Reportedly coming soon
* Miscellaneous
   * Supercharging

Tesla has only a few such products now, but they would likely develop more such products in time. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas referred to this as ""the internet of cars"".

&#x200B;

# Beyond Traditional Automotive Revenues

It's a common statement among Tesla bulls that Tesla is not just an automaker. In my experience sceptics tend to be annoyed by this and (rightly) point out that the supermajority of Tesla's revenue comes from traditional automotive endeavours (selling their cars). While this is true now, it's not necessarily the case 10 years from now, and there's reason to believe that traditional automotive activities may no longer constitute a majority of Tesla's revenue, and may represent an even smaller portion of Tesla's profits.

I'll cover some other businesses of Tesla's that are poised to grow over the next 10 years:

* The aforementioned Network Services
* Energy
* Ridesharing
* Insurance

&#x200B;

**Energy**

Tesla's energy business is poised to benefit substantially from the shift towards renewable power sources. In particular, Tesla's battery storage businesses stands a lot to gain. [Per the Financial Times, total energy storage capacity would grow rapidly over the coming decade to over 700 Gwh by 2030](https://preview.redd.it/wn3yw4g0wz061.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fb25a8c625ab3d725f2895aad4662de4271c6b9).

[Source (Financial Times)](https://www.ft.com/content/7c07e492-41eb-4488-bc34-77b9d806ed5c?shareType=nongift)

&#x200B;

The total addressable market is once again large enough to soak up hyper growth from Tesla over the next decade. Musk himself has stated that he expects Tesla's energy business to be as large as their automotive business long term (a reminder that Tesla's targeted end state is 20 million cars per year).

A refresher on Tesla Energy's available products:

* Solar
   * Tesla solar panels: $1.49/watt (after incentives)
   * Solar Roof
* Battery Storage
   * Power Wall (residential)
   * Power Pack (commercial)
   * Mega Pack (utility scale)

&#x200B;

**Ridesharing**

If Tesla can sufficiently advance their autonomy technology, they may finally be able to launch their autonomous ridesharing network. While Tesla's autonomy technology is currently not yet up to par for this application, their ongoing beta has been rapidly improving with weekly updates. The beta testers have been reporting significant improvements in capability since it was rolled out a month ago.

The bet is that Tesla would be able to reach superhuman driving capability before 2025. Their location agnostic approach would let them scale up operations much more quickly than geofenced competitors (e.g. Waymo).

&#x200B;

**Insurance**

Tesla collates extensive data regarding vehicle usage and the driving patterns of their customers. Combined with their driver assist software, Tesla should be in a privileged position regarding risk assessments for Tesla customers. Using their abundant available data, Tesla may be able to prepare the most compelling insurance package for a sizable fraction of Tesla drivers.

Tesla insurance may also have a synergistic relationship with Tesla's warranty processing and service centres. Tesla insurance customers may be offered discounts on service that wouldn't be available to customers of other insurance providers.

&#x200B;

# Expectations

For public accountability purposes, I'll register my Tesla expectations for this year, next year and 2025. I'm not a financial analyst or otherwise particularly financially savvy, so I'll keep it pretty simple. I'll report my 25% - 75% confidence interval on the following metrics:

* Vehicle deliveries
* Total revenue

&#x200B;

||25%|75%|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2020 Deliveries|160,000|200,000|
|2020 Revenue (USD millions)|30,000|36,000|
|2021 Deliveries|800,000|1,200,000|
|2021 Revenue (USD millions)|48,000|78,000|
|2025 Deliveries|3,000,000|5,000,000|
|2025 Revenue (USD millions)|135,000|350,000|

&#x200B;

The growing variation in the interquartile range is a representation of my growing uncertainty about the business.

I have neither a price target for $TSLA nor concrete expectations for its stock price [(I've said in public before that $TSLA might go to $200 before going to $600)](https://preview.redd.it/v86gdkbhyz061.png?width=873&format=png&auto=webp&s=b26af1f3c8bfdf0048c7f9977ba366dcb344c12a).

I simply believe that Tesla will demonstrate hyper growth over the next decade and have a > 10 year investment horizon, so I would be comfortable investing in $TSLA using dollar cost averaging.

&#x200B;

# Closing Remarks

Many are dubious regarding Tesla's ability to deliver on the formidable vision outlined above. There are certainly numerous risks that may challenge Tesla's ability to deliver on hyper growth. However, as mentioned above, the main challenge to the hypergrowth narrative is execution risks. Fundamentally, it's a question of if Tesla can execute on the vision presented above. Giving their formidable track record so far (and the comparatively less than impressive records of the sceptics), I'm willing to bet that they can.

I think this is mostly because of recent surge and then profit-taking that happen last week. The company is solid however, and all of the charts are pointing up for this thing. I think today is a good time to get in, because in the next few weeks it will be up to 900. 

Love to hear thoughts.",0,0.29
2020-08-18 07:14:38,Lessons from the Japanese asset bubble in the 80s,"For those unfamiliar, the Japanese stock and property markets by 1989 had run up to absurd valuations (the Nikkei 225 hit a Shiller CAPE of 80) and then collapsed, never to recover. I used to think this massive bubble proved you can’t just buy and hold ignoring all fundamentals and valuations, but recently came across this: https://ritholtz.com/2017/10/japan-greatest-bubble-time/

Key takeaways:

> Never underestimate how far people can take the markets to the extremes. This works in both directions. The pendulum swings back and forth but always seems to go further than most would assume is possible. 

> **Valuations don’t work as a timing tool. If you tried to use them in Japan you probably would have gotten out of the market a decade before the peak.** It’s easy to say this in hindsight, but there were few scenarios where the late-1980s real estate and stock market valuations could have been validated going forward.

> Diversification, as always, is the key to avoiding a blow-up. The entire point of diversification is to avoid having your entire portfolio in a Japan situation. The global stock market has done just fine since 1990 **even when you include Japan in the results.**

Other assets you might’ve deiversified into that would’ve saved you: Japanese government bonds, Japanese small cap and value stocks (the Nikkei 225, as name suggests, only has mega caps), and foreign real estate.",1086,0.96
