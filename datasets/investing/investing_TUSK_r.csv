2021-03-17 15:08:15,$TUSK Mammoth Energy Services - Why I'm super bullish,"I came across this comment on $TUSK (Mammoth Energy Services) and I'm very seriously considering allocating \~10-12% of my entire equity portfolio to this stock with a \~3-4 yr time horizon.

A few things:

1. The person who wrote this has deep knowledge of $TUSK and is using a pseudonym, likely a hedge fund guy or a sell-side research analyst that we've probably seen at some point on CNBC. Their knowledge of the energy space & $TUSK is borderline amazing.
2. The author of this comment absolutely destroys the OP / author of this article....who had clearly not done his homework and seemed to misunderstand the entire business model of $TUSK - the comment I'm posting below can be found at the end of this article: [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4411905-mammoth-energy-services-wishin-and-hopin](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4411905-mammoth-energy-services-wishin-and-hopin)
3. I was not aware of $TUSK's migration away from OFS into Infrastructure Services; however, if some of these themes play out that the user ""Falcatus"" suggested, there's a path from a 5.72 stock price to $16-17/sh in \~14-18 months ...imo.",40,0.84
