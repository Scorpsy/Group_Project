TKAT website there is no action since, 2018. They said they have a trading platform which you won't even find it anywhere.

Their listings are non-sense. For example, a random signed football jersey of Nemar is marked as $1M. Even the real jersey likely worth only $1000 and that is not even how NFTs works.
