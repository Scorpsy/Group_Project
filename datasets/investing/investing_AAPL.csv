Even if the UK index was at its high of around 7600, AAPL wouldn't be far off the value of the top 100 firms.

Even with total market funds like Vanguard's VTI, these five stocks make up an outsized portion of the fund because of market cap weight.  

Much like investors using ""ex-US"" funds to increase exposure to international holdings, are there funds that are ""ex-FAANG"" so individuals can lessen the impact?  If not, would another practical strategy be to buy more non-tech sector funds as opposed to say buy more of the 400+ other S&P 500 stocks as counterweight.

Thoughts?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**EDIT1:**  /u/exaggerate_a_point summed up my ask better than my own attempt so I'll add it here instead of responding to similar comments:

> OP specifically said he/she wants to de-risk, aka diversify. It's not about not holding good companies, it's about hedging the risk if one has a bad series of news or events. It's inherently risky if your portfolio is heavily weighted in a handful of companies.

Another good summary of the ask for this discussion from /u/FerociousGiraffe :

>Trying to move your portfolio away from FAANG isn’t to say those are great, successful, hugely profitable companies. You’d keep a position in them. It’s about protecting against news that will only hurt FAANG while not hurting the broader market.

**EDIT2:**  For comments related to balancing with international equities, this discussion is contained for U.S. equities.  Assume whatever percentage of bonds, precious metals, digital currency, international equities or whatever you think is appropriate in a portfolio has been addressed.

**EDIT3:**  Outside of suggestions like ""Why do you hate winning?"", some of the top solutions to dilute these stocks from your S&P 500 / U.S. equities part of a portfolio:

* Many suggest a variation of my original post of simply adding more sector funds outside of tech.  Though this strategy will unfortunately remove many non-giant tech companies in this sector.

* Many of you like /u/desquibnt suggests equal weighted ETFs like RSP.  However, RSP has a high net expense ratio of 0.20%.  

* /u/TriathlonNerd suggests a reverse cap weighted ETF like RVRS.  This too has a high net expense ratio of 0.29%.

* /u/BubbyginkESO and others suggests going broader than just 500 companies with low cost total market funds like Vanguard's VTI or Fidelity's FZROX.  While these 5 stocks still make up the top holdings, the effect of a larger basket of stocks also dilutes these companies.  So far, I like this simple and practical one the best.",1764,0.96
2020-09-22 08:23:35,"Video explaining the huge growth of large cap growth stocks (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, FB, GOOGL)","I've seen this question everywhere on this sub: ""why did apple/tesla/[insert large growth company name here] growth so much so quick! They still haven't made a lot of profit! We are in a bubble!""

Well, it is difficult to explain why to every person individually and this new video from Ben Felix explains the reason why expertly.

https://youtu.be/foqswJT3Spc

The conclusion the video comes to is that you should just stick to low cost index funds (preferably globally diversified) rather than investing into large cap growth or trying to find the next Apple or Amazon.

**EDIT:** The definition of a ""growth"" company (as literally explained in the video) is a company that is ""expensive"" relative to the market. Expensive how? Well, relative to some fundamental ratio like P/B or P/E. Considering all the companies I have listed in my title have relatively high P/E and P/B ratios, you can say they are expensive. This makes them by definition a growth company. This isn't that hard to understand. If I said they are tech companies, no one would argue because they literally are tech companies. Well, just as much as they are tech companies, they are growth companies. They might not all be as expensive as each other, but relative to the market, they are expensive.

I am not commenting about how all these companies are as overbought as each other, or they are the same in every metric, I just listed some large-cap growth companies based on the definition of growth being expensive.",964,0.91
2020-11-07 16:03:07,"What is a True Market Leader (TML) + And how to find them? (Ex. SHOP 2016-2020, ZM 2020, AAPL 2005-2012"," 

**TLDR:**

In one sentence a TML is an institutional quality stock in a leading industry group with superior fundamentals and technicals. These are monster stocks which over the course of weeks and months increase +100% to +5,000% . These stocks are disruptors which change how we work, live, or play.

TMLs are popular with traders/investors whose methodology is based on the CANSLIM system developed by William O'Neil. He called them Model Book Stocks. Huge winners worth studying to identify common characteristics that they all share O'Neil studied over 1000 model book stocks going back to the 1880s. Many are shown and discussed in these must read books

* How To Make Money in Stocks, William O'Neil
* Monster Stocks: How They Set Up, Run Up, Top and Make You Money , John Boik
* The Lifecycle Trade: How to Win at Trading IPOs and Super Growth Stocks, Eric Krull, Kathy Donnelly, and Kurt Dail

**A few Historical Examples** from William O'Neil's How To Find & Own America's Greatest Opportunities

Qualcomm 1997 [https://imgur.com/oYPItOW](https://imgur.com/oYPItOW)

Yahoo 1996 [https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ](https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ)

**So what are the Fundamental characteristics of a TML? You want to see superior:**

* Quarterly Sales Growth > 25% YoY
* Quarterly Earnings Growth > 25% YoY
* Pre+After Tax Margins >20% Recent Quarters
* ROE >17%
* Annual Earnings Ests for the next year > 25%

And above all else you want the stock to have a great story- A new and innovative product or service that changes how we work live or play. Not every TML will have all of these criteria, but in general their record should be outstanding with regards to most of them. The higher these values the better. Earnings and Sales growth over 100% YoY is ideal. Annual Estimates for next year over 100% would be exceptional.

TMLs are also often in the Top 20 Industry groups at the times of their runs. The TML is the leader of an overall top group which is riding the tailwinds of changing environments. Recent examples $SE $SHOP $AMZN Retail-Internet and $TSLA $NIO Electric Vehicles (Auto Manufacturers)

Additionally base liquidity is required for these stocks to be institutional quality. Dollar Volume > $30 Million is essential and most should have DV much higher than that. Accumulation by big hedge funds and mutual funds like Fidelity Contrafund are what move the markets. They won't touch a promising stock unless it has liquidity.

**Now for Technical (Price Action) Characteristics of TMLs.**

They should be:

* Above a Rising 30 Week Moving Average
* Breaking out of a Stage 1 or Stage 2 Base
* Trending above Key Moving Averages (10, 21ema, 50sma)
* Volume and Price contractions within bases
* Up/Down Vol> 1.2
* Huge gaps up on volume after Earning Beat
* And most importantly they must be showing Relative Strength, meaning they are outperforming the vast majority of stocks in the market. This. is. vital.

During corrections and overall market weakness they should be near all time highs, above their longer term moving averages. They should be standing out like a sore thumb and yelling ""Buy me"". And during Market Uptrends they should be trending above the shorter term moving averages, forming sideways price shelfs during small pullbacks and then breaking out again. Most stay above their 50 SMAs and even 21 emas for extended periods of time.

**So how to scan for them:**

Use MarketSmith, the IBD Stock Screener, Finviz, or another screener and screen for the fundamental criteria mentioned above combined with the stock over the 200+50 SMA. It's helpful to have multiple screens splitting up the criteria for instance one scan for the earnings and one for sales.

That gap feels large to me. Also, FB is valued at $760B with much lower revenue and decelerating growth, so its gap vs GOOG seems small. 

Is GOOG a good buy? Are these other companies just overvalued? Curious what you all think.  
Here's my thinking:

* GOOG has rock-solid fundamentals - excellent gross margins, has maintained \~15%+ YoY revenue growth even at their scale, and search is a steady business with many entrypoints across the Google ecosystem
* GOOG has bets across so many forward-looking industries that I think they will be able to diversify over time and don't have real risk of not continuing to innovate. There's of course the risk of anti-trust and privacy regulations, but that's been true for years now (although things do appear to be ratcheting up).
* It seems their stock hasn't mooned during covid because a meaningful share of search volume (and subsequently search revenue) comes from brick-and-mortar businesses (as opposed to someone like FB, whose ads biz is more of an ecommerce/direct-to-consumer play), which puts a drag on their revenue. This was the main reason for their relatively weak Q2 earnings a couple weeks back.

2020-09-22 06:15:24,"$AAPL - Raymond James raise estimates ahead of iPhone 12 launch on ""favorable mix""","Raymond James:

We reiterate our Outperform rating on Apple and raise our price target to $120. Raising our estimates following our production checks ahead of next quarter’s iPhone 12 launch. While our total production estimates are in-line with current consensus, we expect upside driven by mix. Current production plans suggest the most favorable mix we’ve ever seen for an iPhone launch, and the introduction of a fourth iPhone model at a price between iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro will also help to boost blended ASPs. While the stock has already had a strong run since our upgrade last summer, **we don’t yet think all the benefits of what we expect to be a 2-year 5G upgrade cycle are yet reflected in consensus estimates.**

iPhone 12 mix and pricing. **We conducted channel checks across the iPhone supply chain last week, and confirmed that Apple will launch four new models** in the iPhone 12 lineup this year: an entry-level iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Max, Pro, and Max Pro. We provide a breakdown of specs for each model on the following page. While our sources don't have visibility into pricing at this point, we would expect the base model to start at $699 - the same as last year's iPhone 11, but with a smaller screen. We expect the Pro and Max Pro to remain premium tier phones, priced at $999 and $1099 to start. For the iPhone Max, we expect Apple to likely price it at a modest premium to the base model, in the range of $799.

**Our production checks are consistent with consensus expectations, but mix appears favorable.** According to our checks, build plans support production of \~75 million units for the launch, including 64 million new models. While we believe this is consistent with industry expectations, the mix assumptions driven by the initial build plans **suggest a meaningful rise in blended ASPs**. There's no guarantee that current build plans will reflect what consumers will actually buy, but the build plans provide insight into Apple's expectations. The table on the following page illustrates our production and sell-through estimates for the December quarter. We're assuming that Apple will build more aggressively on higher priced SKUs to make sure they are available for holiday purchases, and we expect that lower priced SKUs will likely sell out before Christmas.

Adjusting estimates. While our September quarter estimates remain unchanged (and well below consensus), we are **raising our FY21 EPS estimate to $3.93 to reflect our current assumptions for iPhone 12 mix**. Notably, if we assume December quarter sell-through matches production estimates, our revenue and EPS estimates would move higher by \~$5.3 billion and $0.09, respectively. For FY22, our split-adjusted estimate moves to $4.53, assuming Apple keeps the fourtier pricing scheme for the upcoming iPhone 13 and 14 cycles.

Our new $120 price target (from $110) is based on a \~26x multiple on our split-adjusted FY22 EPS estimate and 19x an annualized estimate of peak seasonal EPS of over $6/share. While this is above the 3- and 5-year average in the \~15x range, on an EV/FCF basis, our price target assumes an 18x multiple, well below the historical range in the low-20s.",179,0.93

""Yesterday, the House subcommittee on Antitrust released a 450-page report outlining anticompetitive threats posed by AAPL, AMZN, FB and GOOGL. Our key take-aways from the 45 AAPL pages include: a) dozens of complaints about AAPL (out of the 20mm app developers and 1.8mm apps in AAPL's App Store), with zero positives about AAPL's value to consumers or lifeimproving innovations; b) underscores AAPL's strong shareholder value proposition and finds fault with widely used business practices such as bundling; and c) most complaints about AAPL are biz judgments (they charge too much, they pre-load their apps, etc), and not easily fixable through regulation. Finally, because AAPL's core asset is access to nearly 1B of the wealthiest consumers, we do not expect this report to materially impact valuation.""

""Relating to key issues raised by the House report about AAPL, regulatory experts at Technology Policy Institute (TPI) believe:

1. ""The key regulatory question is whether Apple uses the App Store to systematically foreclose competition or engage in unfair or deceptive practices using quality control as an excuse. This question cannot be answered by claims of a few developers, whose particular apps may have been technically deficient, failed to meet some security standard, or whose apps were unfortunately harmed by legitimate changes in the App Store. ""
2. ""Determining whether Apple behaved anti-competitively when it pre-loads its owned 40 apps will involve considerations such as the difficulty of downloading and installing replacements for AAPL's pre-loaded apps (ie, none), the level of integration of AAPL's owned apps with its operating system, and any negative effects on innovation inside AAPL's app ecosystem.""
3. ""Whether Apple’s app review policies are antitrust violations will hinge on how its policies affect the market and whether prosecutors can prove that the issues raised are not just disputes between large companies over how to distribute profits and protect user privacy/security. Not being able to pay for Netflix and Spotify within an app are not, by definition, harms. To prove harm, a plaintiff would have to demonstrate that their absence foreclosed access, thereby harming consumers.""

2020-07-06 14:53:15,$AAPL - iOS14 changes could cut app ad monetization by 50%,"When Apple rolls out iOS14 (likely in September), any app/developer who wants access to the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) for an Apple device will need to get user consent again. (IDFA is currently used by advertisers to track users across apps/websites).

That consent is stored and only reset if user uninstall/reinstall the app, so the app can't just keep prompting for user for consent over and over. Also, AAPL will control the language/presentation of the consent prompt, although developers should still have some options around how to minimize opt-outs (e.g. degrading app experience until user accepts tracking).

According to a research report by D. A. Davidson, this change is not completely unexpected. A poll by Ad Profs (an independent ad tech consultancy) in Sep 2019 suggests \~80% of those surveyed had expected some major change to IDFA within a year. They estimate 1/2 of iOS users will upgrade to iOS14 within a few weeks of rollout, and above 90% of users will have upgraded by Q1 of 2021.

Ad Profs also estimate the iOS14 upgrade will result in \~50% cut to app ad monetization. They believe AAPL is secretly pushing App developers to encourage users who opt-out to pay for the app via in-app purchases because AAPL gets a 30% cut from those payments.",160,0.92

1. Anti-trust debate - the benefits of large companies is being clearly demonstrated during this crisis - FB's apps enabling the sharp increase in communication, AMZN's logistics delivering critical goods to consumers, innovative health apps and 1m masks/week from AAPL. The rise of TikTok and Zoom also illustrate large companies are not stifling competition. In fact, they have allowed Americans (voters) to live better lives during this pandemic.
2. Privacy debate - data collection has driven rapid innovation during COVID (e.g. thermometer apps tracking virus spread across the US by location). Countries that appear to have greatest success at containing COVID-19 also have the most aggressive data gathering tools (e.g. China, Singapore).
3. fake news debate - FB and GOOGL have been proactively taking down false info during COVID-19, which appears to be helping their case to policy makers.

Finally, rather than furloughing employees, these big tech companies are hiring and helping to mitigate the economic stress during this crisis.

2020-08-16 07:36:43,Shorting AAPL with a covered Put,"If you thought that AAPL was going up in the long term but would dip in the short term, what is the potential down side of shorting with a covered put?

Lets say I short 100 shares of AAPL at $459.78 and sell a covered put at the $455 strike price for Net Credit premium of $588.

Here are the scenarios I can see playing out. Let me know if I missed anything?

1. AAPL dips and the put is executed. I would be obligated to buy at the strike price, but this would make a profit of $4.78 per share.$4.78 x 100 plus the premium of $588 is a profit of $1066.
2. AAPL dips and the put is not executed. Unlikely that the put will not be executed, but I would buy at a profit.
3. AAPL dips and the put is not executed, but goes up monday. Also unlikely that the put will not be executed, but I would sell another covered put and to repeat.
4. AAPL stays around the same so the put is not executed, but AAPL goes up monday:I would sell another covered put and repeat.
5. AAPL goes up and the put is not executed. I would set a stop loss at $465.66 and break even offsetting the premium of $588.
6. AAPL goes up and the stop loss is executed, but dips and the put is executed:I would be holding 100 shares of AAPL, but if the stock's trend is up then I can break even eventually.
7. AAPL goes up and the stop loss is executed, but dips and the put is executed and the trend is reversed. This would be the worst case scenario, but unlikely.

2021-02-04 05:39:29,10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.  Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why:

1. THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, [https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq](https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq) .  The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work).  Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO.  A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs.  Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade.
2. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, [https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/](https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/) .  This ETF is... highly intriguing.  It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%).  They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM.  Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily).  What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology.  Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit.  The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO.  The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB.   SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF.  Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive.  Index methodology here: [https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf](https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf)
3. DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl) .  Its methodology is in the prospectus, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus) .  Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to [etfrc.com](https://etfrc.com). So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way.  Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ.  Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF!
4. SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund) . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change.""  ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s) ).  Methodology here: [https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index](https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index) .  It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in.  It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year!
5. FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, [https://freedometfs.com/frdm/](https://freedometfs.com/frdm/) . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores.  Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red.  If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like.  Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF.  Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox!
6. EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund) . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index.  Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil.  It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all).  Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung.
7. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf) .  One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets.  Really heavy on tech and luxury.  If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like.  High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH.
8. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, [https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html](https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html) .  Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options.  Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times.  Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF.  Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement.  Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X.
9. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, [https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx) .  Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries.  But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure.  Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund.  There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design.
10. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf) .  This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF.  You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise.  But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values.  Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk.  A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields.

ok, here's a bonus #11:

11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA) .  This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year.  But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted.  US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along.  Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector.

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future.

What do you guys think?  Any of those look like something you might invest in?  Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?

2021-02-23 11:24:56,Watch your P/S Ratio. P/S over 30 is incredibly risky.,"**What is a P/S ratio?** 

Price / Sales ratio. The higher the number, the more expensive the stock is compared to sales.

**What about P/E ratio?** 

Price / Earnings ratio is great for mature companies, but the hottest stocks typically lose money, so P/S is a quick and lazy proxy.

**Got an example?** 

Take AAPL's Market Cap of $2113B and TTM sales of $294B. 2113/294=7. So the P/S ratio of AAPL is 7. Is that good or bad? Well it depends on the industry. Typically Apple has a PS ratio of 2-5. APPL had a PS ratio of 7 at the end of 2007, and we all know what happened in 2008, right?

**What does the P/S ratio have to do with anything?**

There are currently [54 stocks with a PS over 30](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=121&f=cap_largeover,fa_ps_o10&o=-ps&r=41).

The stocks with the highest P/S ratio [are getting hit the hardest](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=141&f=cap_largeover,fa_ps_o10&o=-ps).

**Is having a PS ratio over 30 bad?** 

Historically, anything with a P/S over 30 underperforms as an investment. The revenue growth will outperform, but the overall stock still underperforms, because all that revenue growth was already priced in.  None of the FANG stocks ever exceeded a P/S ratio of 25. MSFT had a PS ratio of about 28 back in 1999, and it took 17 years for the price to recover. 

**When was the last time we had this many stocks with a P/S over 30?** 

At the end of 1999 we had 22, making up 6.70% of US market cap. From 2001-2019 we had very few. At the end of 2020 we had 50, making up 4.80% of US market cap. 

**How significant is this?** 

I don't know, man. 5% of the market is not significant. Also, there isn't a lot of data, only 31 stocks went over a P/S ratio of 30 from 2001-2019 (the other 85 instances occurred in 2000 & 2020.)  Also it's worth noting the valuation of all stocks [has been trending up](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-sales) because of low rates. Yay?

**What should you do?** 

I don't know, man. I am not a broker/ dealer. This is not advice. You can quickly check your individual stocks P/S ratio on [finviz](https://finviz.com/). P/S over 10 is red, which means you should dig deeper.

**Edit:** No I am not implying Apple caused the housing bubble to pop in 2008. Let me be specific. From 2007 to 2008 Apples revenue went up (24b to 32b), earnings went up (3.4b-4.8b), but its stock fell (180-85).

TSLA and AAPL stocks just split, and in real life this did not effect me since I was compensated. But in the simulator it shows a loss of $2,000,000. 

Does this happen normally and will it resolve itself with time? Does it just take a while for it to process splits? Or do I have to abandon the simulator?

I think Canoo is an awesome company in it's own right, but just presenting some potentially interesting info for folks here.

**Timeline:**

* **July 2019** –Hyundai is developing an electric vehicle platform called E-GMP ([https://www.electrive.com/2019/06/25/hyundai-is-developing-an-ev-platform/](https://www.electrive.com/2019/06/25/hyundai-is-developing-an-ev-platform/))
* **Feb 2020** – Canoo and Hyundai co-developing skateboard for Hyundai's and Kia's future EVs / PBVs ([https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/2982](https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/2982))
* **Aug 2020** \- Investor presentation restates Hyundai/Canoo partnership and also mentions a tech company using Canoo as base platform for it's smart car / AV (potentially Apple?)
* **Dec 2020** – Canoo executive chairman says Apple entering market is a “very good thing” ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-apple-entering-the-ev-market-is-a-good-thing-113808559.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-apple-entering-the-ev-market-is-a-good-thing-113808559.html))
* **Dec 2020** – Hyundai presents e-gmp at a digital event, which does not look like Canoo tech ([https://www.electrive.com/2020/12/02/hyundai-presents-e-gmp-electric-car-platform/](https://www.electrive.com/2020/12/02/hyundai-presents-e-gmp-electric-car-platform/))
* **Jan 2021** – Hyundai and Apple confirmed to be working on Apple car; Kia to manufacture ([https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/apple-car-kia-hyundai-work/](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/apple-car-kia-hyundai-work/))
* **Jan 2021** – Several sources reveal Apple attempted to buy Canoo and was turned down; when asked to comment on it the exec chairman says “Canoo doesn’t openly comment on strategic discussions, relationships or partnerships unless deemed appropriate,” (potentially nothing but interesting choice of verbiage) ([https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev))
* **Feb 2021** – Analyst says “initial” Apple car will be based on e-gmp platform; car won’t be released until 2024/2025 ([https://seekingalpha.com/news/3657363-apple-will-team-with-hyundai-for-first-apple-car-model-says-noted-analyst](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3657363-apple-will-team-with-hyundai-for-first-apple-car-model-says-noted-analyst))
* **Feb 2021** – Apple to invest 3.6B in Kia for EV partnership (likely manufacturing capacity) and partnership confirmed through multiple sources ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-03/apple-to-invest-3-6-billion-in-kia-to-make-evs-donga-says](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-03/apple-to-invest-3-6-billion-in-kia-to-make-evs-donga-says))

**My** **rationale:**

Hyundai was already building the E-GMP platform in 2019 and was still actively seeking partners to develop future tech for skateboard and formed a partnership with Canoo to do exactly that. They indicated that this co-developed platform would be used in future vehicles. The E-GMP platform they eventually released seems way less advanced than Canoo's platform in the photos (e.g. it has struts vs Canoo's with leaf spring suspension), so the E-GMP platform could be the intermediate step until the co-developed platform is ready.

Apple tried to buy Canoo for it’s skateboard platform in 2020 and was turned down by Canoo. This makes a lot of sense for Apple because Canoo platform is really advanced (steer-by-wire, leaf spring suspension, crash test incorporated into skateboard, batteries incorporated into structure, very modular and fast development times/costs) and lets Apple focus on what they excel at, which is tech and quick development cycles.

Apple eventually forms a manufacturing partnership with Hyundai and it's rumored they're using Hyundai skateboard in the ""initial"" version, which is important because it signals they still want to use 3P skateboard. It seems that while they are likely using the E-GMP platform for the first iteration, the 2024 timeline easily puts them in line to use the new Canoo/Hyundai platform when it is done, which is consistent with the fact that Apple has already tried to purchase Canoo specifically for it's skateboard platform.

**tl;dr -** seems very possible that the Apple car will use the Canoo skateboard as the foundation",279,0.97

2021-01-24 05:09:56,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

2021-02-09 04:23:19,Second Quarter Results: 6 months into the /r/investing underrated stock survey and the average return was 72% (37% as a portfolio),"Building on a previous post ([http://redd.it/i2thge/](http://redd.it/i2thge/)) asking the community to pick underrated stocks, there was interest in seeing the quarterly performance of everyone's picks

The first quarter can be seen here: [http://redd.it/jti14m/](http://redd.it/jti14m/)

For this quarter, the key takeaways are as follows:

* Overall average return of 72.2% (driven by the GME pick)
* If you invested equally in each stock, returns would have been 41.9%, or if you bought one of each stock, returns would have been 37.5%
* 86% of the 254 picks have shown a positive return, with 80% greater than 10% return and 20% greater than 100% return
* Highest returning pick: Gamestock (GME) at 1342% flagged by  /u/EmployerOfTheMonth, to which they stated *""If it goes up, people will think I'm some sort genius for going against the crowd, if it goes down, people will just mindly brush me off as a moron for actually thinking this was underrated""*
* If you invested in the top 5 most upvoted stocks (NET, CRSP, STNE, NVDA, NOK), you would have seen an average return of 62%
* If you invested in the top 5 most controversial stocks (TSLA, WD, AMD, LMND, UBER), you would have seen a return of 93%
* If you had invested equally in the stocks with greater than 10% return in the first 30 days, your total return would be 53.1%

In graphical format, you can also see the results here: [https://i.imgur.com/CzEYTxv.png](https://i.imgur.com/CzEYTxv.png)

# For those who keep asking for another round of tracking underrated stocks, I'll add a comment below to collect new picks to monitor.  Happy to update you on a similar cadence.

As a reminder, please do not interpret results seen here as an endorsement of the investing prowess of the community. Invest at your own risk.

For those also interested, there was a stock picking survey back in October of 2018.

For those preferring a more concentrated portfolio style, I think this is an interesting question - because these are all great companies, but naturally one must be better than the others.

If you had to pick just one of the mega-caps, which do you buy today?

My personal thoughts:

- Facebook. I see potential competition to their network, but the balance sheet is a fortress and valuation has been pushed down a bit due to general public hatred. A contrarian pick. (B)

- Apple. In my opinion the valuation of this has run away farther ahead of its earnings relative to the others, making it the least attractive of the bunch for me. (C-)

- Amazon. Doing amazing things, looking at the last several quarters their earnings seem to be accelerating - however the p/e is higher than all the rest. (A-)

- Microsoft. The sleeper choice, solid valuation in addition to growth. Not flashy but a money printer. (A)

- Google. My perception is that they're slipping - taking lots of high risk/high payoff bets that don't appear to be paying off yet. Feels potentially contrarian but I'm not wildly excited. (C)?

- Bonus: Mastercard/Visa. Secular trend away from cash makes these seem like long term great picks, in spite of fin-tech disruptors. Not cheap valuations though. I favor MA over V for efficient use of capital. (B+)

2021-02-14 06:50:25,Analysing Institutional Investor Transactions,"Hi all, I came up with a good way to extract institutional investor transactions using Python from an API in order to analyse if investors are buying or selling stocks in a particular company. 

For example, below table is the outcome showing the transactions reported by institutional investors since the 11th of February on 4 different companies.


    total   buys  sells      total_shares_exchanged
    AAPL  159.0  127.0   32.0           122816727.0
    MSFT  293.0  251.0   42.0             292622179.0
    ETSY   42.0   37.0    5.0               3978781.0
    ATVI  115.0  104.0   11.0               1161650.0


While the data is useful, I am struggling to make a good use of it. For instance, if I look into MSFT, I can see that 127 institutional funds bough stocks in MSFT and 27 sold stocks. 

What I would like to do with this analysis is to find stocks that institutional investors are currently buying a lot. 

Does someone know what would be the best approach to do this? I thought about running the script for a bunch of companies and compare them together. But that approach does not make sense because obviously, large market-cap companies will attract more transactions than small-cap companies and they may not be really comparable.

In case any of you is interested on how to get institutional investor transactions using Python, I have a video showing step by step:

“Disney+ has exceeded even our highest expectations,” Chapek said in a [conference call with analysts](https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/snvice4i) later, noting it stood at 26.5 million subscribers in the same-quarter a year ago. He also noted spikes in usage for ESPN+ (up 83% to 12.1 million) and Hulu (up 30% to 35.4 million).

Disney’s Media and Entertainment Distribution, which includes Disney+, brought in $12.66 billion for the quarter, a decline of 5% from the same quarter a year ago before the pandemic swept across the country. The Disney Parks, Experiences and Products unit took in $3.6 billion, down 53% year-over-year as many Disney parks and its cruise line remain closed. The flagship Disneyland Park in Anaheim, Calif., and Disneyland Paris will stay closed in the current quarter, Disney Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said during the analyst call.

It will be a battle of the network effects, and AAPL is well positioned to win/outperform because:

1) it has direct  relationships with 900m or 15% of the world's wealthiest consumers;

2)  its successful transition from a product-based company to an ecosystem  company means its relationship with users is becoming increasingly sticky and a product-based company (e.g. Samsung) can no longer  disrupt AAPL; only another ecosystem company (e.g. Google) could  compete;

3) AAPL's increasingly recurring-revenue business model is  driving its valuation multiple expansion;

4) AAPL has the best data for machine learning and AI to drive long-term data network effects,  because its closed ecosystem greatly limits fraud;

5) its enormous net cash position provides the flexibility to invest strategically and  return of capital.",70,0.76
2020-07-14 09:24:33,$AAPL - Morgan Stanley says expanded iPhone trade-in program can fund 1/3 of upgrades over next 3 years,"According to analysts at MS, growing adoption of iPhone trade-in programs creates a sustainable competitive advantage for AAPL because of the iPhone's strong resell value.

Currently, 48% of consumers use trade-in programs. Based on MS checks, adoption of trade-in programs is rising across the US, UK, Germany, China and India, and 77% of consumers expect to trade in by 2021. Assuming iPhone trade-in adoption reaches that 77% level, affordability will improve by 10%+ over the next five years.

MS says the strong resell value of the iPhone is a key differentiator for AAPL (2.6x higher residual value vs. comparable Android devices). With the iPhone replacement cycle already stretched to 4.1 years, increased adoption and value of trade-ins will become ""an accelerant of 5G upgrades"".

iPhone affordability is also improving ""materially"" because Apple's 5G iPhone prices reportedly won't change from the 4G predecessors, while competitors are raising prices. When combined with an average trade-in value of $164, MS estimates net prices for iPhone 5G could start closer to $535 (vs. average 5G smartphone ASP of $735 over in last two quarters).",3,0.64

2020-03-24 09:45:24,"$AAPL: big cuts to 1H estimates, recovery expected in the fall","As expected, the street is continuing to trim estimates for the Mar and Jun quarters due to the impact of COVID-19. This time the cuts are much bigger (13-15% cut for Mar quarter, 15-20% cut for Jun quarter) now that there is greater visibility to the supply chain disruptions in China for much of the Mar quarter, as well as the demand pressures in China for most of the Mar quarter spreading to the rest of the world starting late Feb.

Analyst checks on global smartphone shipment data indicate a 38% y/y decline for Feb, which is the largest decline ever. Expectation now is that the demand pressures will persist in North America (US \~45% of sales) and Europe (\~25% of sales) for most of the Jun quarter as China begins to slowly recover. While Macs and iPads should arguably do better than iPhones in this environment of learn/work from home, technology purchases in general are currently far from consumers' top of mind.

All the bad news near term aside, the long-term bull thesis for AAPL remains intact. AAPL has \~$100bn in net cash, generated \~$64b in free cash LTM, and has \~20x interest coverage ratio - it is as safe as any company can be in weathering this pandemic, not to mention its flexibility for buybacks. Since AAPL is expected to launch its 5G iPhones in the fall, it should be less hurt than other makers already on the market today.

2021-02-07 09:10:46,Companies with low PE & high PB ratio,"I often look at PE & PB ratio to judge whether the company I am interested in, is rightly valued as per my investing strategy.

If I look at Apple, its PE ratio is 37 & PB ratio is 34. To me this sounds like an unusual case. A very high PB ratio indicates that the current price of a stock is high (very high in this case) compared to its book value. However, Apple's PE ratio is not insanely high at the same price.

This means that Apple is able to generate a lot of revenue & profits with fewer assets that make up book value. Would this inference be correct? If yes, does this somehow pose a problem for Apple's business in future?  


My understanding is that since Apple outsources all of its production not just to another country but also to another company, this is what is leading to a very low book value.",72,0.88

2020-02-10 16:57:21,($AAPL) Apple Intrinsic Valuation as of 2/10/2020. What do you think Apple stock is worth?,"Hello everyone! To keep this post a reasonable length I will link to my valuation hosted on Adobe's document cloud. [Link to full valuation in pdf format here!](https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn%3Aaaid%3Ascds%3AUS%3Ae4edb1a1-16a2-4e6a-a52b-b4a105a981c7) (If you want to skip the explanation of the inputs the story behind the numbers is located on pages 8-9 and the DCF model is located on page 10). Please take a look at the valuation before bashing or agreeing with my range.

For the past year Apple has been on a massive run with seemingly no sign of stopping. Analysts have been upping their price targets and managers who have missed out on the run are piling in. With Apple recently reporting earnings, there has been renewed debate about what price investors should be paying for stock in Apple. Many say that the company is expensive and point to relative valuation measures such as P/E that are above their long term averages. Others say the company is inexpensive and point to growing revenue segments such as wearables and services.

My preferred method of valuing companies is intrinsic valuation, and what I present here is an intrinsic valuation assessing the value of equity in Apple using a DCF model. I am hoping to start a discussion about what others believe that Apple stock is worth, as well as what assumptions I have made that others agree or disagree with.

I present a base case, bull case, and bear case for Apple and what each of those scenarios would potentially look like. If I was an analyst I would give the stock a buy rating and place the fair value range of Apple stock between $350 and $400. This is NOT a price target and is based on the assumptions which are outlined in the paper.

2021-02-18 23:56:51,Why I'm bearish on Peloton ($PTON),"First off, I love Peloton. I think their equipment is superior and the services they offer are out of this world. However, at a market cap over $40B they are grossly overvalued.

$PTON is up well over 500% since debuting on the NASDAQ. Like many tech companies they never turned a profit until COVID-19 hit. For a company like Peloton, COVID was the best thing that could have happened. As gyms shut their doors and locked customers outside, Peloton sales spiked. For the first time since going public they posted a profitable quarter in Q2 2020. They have recently reported record quarterly revenue numbers. 

With all this good, how can I remain a bear?

For starters, Peloton relies on a subscription service to maintain their revenue stream. After the high up-front cost of upwards of $2,500 for the exercise bike, customers turn to a $39 monthly subscription plan.  Far cheaper alternatives exist for consumers.

Planet Fitness offered their members access to iFit last year. Lululemon, a leader in fitness apparel, bought Mirror, the maker of a smart screen for home workouts. Apple ($AAPL), *currently trading at a discount*, recently debuted Fitness+ which offers a far cheaper alternative to a Peloton subscription. Other companies also joining the fitness app sector are Nike, Strava, and Under Armour. Peloton no longer controls the market.

While I'm not nearly as bearish as Simeon Siegel, a BMO Capital Markets analyst, I do agree with his sentiment that $PTON is greatly overvalued. Siegel has claimed $PTON is ""*detached from reality*"" and should be trading in the low $30s. 

If $PTON doesn't diversify, and diversify soon, they may be trading at their all-time high. They're running up against a lot of competition and have yet to fully diversify their offerings.

Peloton as a company is great, $PTON as an investment, not so much. There are better investments out there, don't chase the yellow jersey.",41,0.78
2021-02-28 12:00:47,All P/Es are not created equal - Lowe's vs Home Depot,"[https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/all-pes-are-not-created-equal](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/all-pes-are-not-created-equal)  


This article is a little dated, but very relevant to investors starting out. All too often I'll see comments indicating it isn't good ""value"" based on some arbitrary P/E. A company can appear to be more ""expensive"", but still generate better returns than a similar company that trades at a lower P/E, but has inferior returns on invested capital (ROIC). 

Two companies I've been looking at are Home Depot ($HD) and Lowe's ($LOW). Both are excellent companies and both have handily outperformed the market over the last 10 years. 

[However, between the two of them, $HD outperformed $LOW because of a better ROIC which translated to a higher earnings growth.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=2&startYear=2011&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=1000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=2&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=VFINX&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=HD&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=LOW&allocation2_2=100)

At the start of 2011, both companies were trading at a trailing P/E of approx 18 and both are currently trading at a trailing P/E of approx 22.  

**Lowe's**

A $1000, investment in $LOW would be worth $7668. CAGR of 22.18% (very impressive compared to SPY's 13.6%)

EPS grew from $1.42 to $7.10 in that period at a CAGR of approx 17.5% (the rest of the returns can be attributed to P/E expansion)

**Home Depot**

A $1000, investment in $HD would be worth $9267. CAGR of 24.48% 

EPS grew from $2.01 to $11.57 in that period at a CAGR of approx 19.13% (the rest of the returns can be attributed to P/E expansion)

**The same amount invested in HD resulted in a 20% higher total return over a 10 year period.** 

I want to be clear that a high ROIC isn't the be-all and end-all of an investment thesis. The price you pay absolutely matters. But when I screen for stocks, I like to find a company with a solid track record of generating high ROIC over a 10-15 year period. A superior ROIC can be considered a company's ""moat"" as it seems to have some secret sauce that lets it generate profits more efficiently than its peers. A healthy ROIC is indicative of a company that is capable of growing the top line efficiently and/or commands strong margins (both of which translate to EPS growth).

 **Keep in mind, when looking at a company's ROIC, you want to measure it with respect to their peers and the company's cost of capital.**  

I'd say my investment strategy is to find high ROIC businesses in sectors I somewhat understand (consumer staples, consumer goods and retail), build a position when the stock is at a price I find appealing and then hold for as long as the company keeps generating high ROICs (however long that may be). There's a few variations to the formula that calculates a company's ROIC, but here's a simple version that works pretty well (assuming you want to calculate it yourself from the financial statements as opposed to looking it up on Morningstar/ValueLine etc)

ROIC = Operating Profit/(Total Assets - Current portion of Debt - Cash)

So for those of you that may be interested in following that investment strategy, here's my watchlist (some of which I own). 

**Consumer Staples -** Brown Forman ($BF.A,) Colgate ($CL), Clorox ($CLX), Hershey ($HSY), Coca-Cola ($KO), Altria ($MO), Philip Morris ($PM), Monster Beverage ($MNST), Boston Beer Co ($SAM) and Unilever ($UL).

**Consumer Goods -** Apple ($AAPL), Lululemon Athletica ($LULU) and Nike ($NKE).

**Retail and Restaurants -** Dominos ($DPZ), Home Depot ($HD), McDonalds ($MCD), O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY) and Starbucks ($SBUX), Ross Stores ($ROST) and TJX Companies ($TJX).

**Financial Services -** Mastercard ($MA) and S&P Global Inc ($SPGI)

**There's no guarantee that such stocks will always outperform or that they can maintain high ROICs indefinitely.** However, it's a good place to start.

**TLDR:** High ROIC companies generally trade at a premium. This is because they are able to grow earnings faster and/or return more capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.",50,0.85

This was over a month ago, even before anything happened in the homeland and Europe. Fast forward today, world is in a lockdown. Retail is dead for a month, unless you assume everyone who wanted something is buying it from their website, and they didn't lose any revenue, how is this sustainable? Isn't it obvious these companies will need to adjust their guidance again? or its priced in?",0,0.5
2020-04-03 07:40:04,Assumptions for $AAPL through this crisis:,"While this crisis began with supply chain constraints that now appear to be easing, the bigger concerns have shifted to the demand side pressures. With extensive stay-at-home measures against COVID-19 weakening global demand and extending store closures, street estimates are likely to be revised over the coming weeks to reflect the following assumptions:

1) China had the weakest demand in Feb, and is steadily improving through the summer.

2) Rest of World will see weakest demand in April, and slowly easing thereafter.

3) The global economic impact from this crisis will hurt consumer spending, and extend the iPhone upgrade cycle.

Surprisingly, the expected increase in screen time as a result of working from home does not appear to be fueling Service growth. Analyst checks indicate the App Store actually decelerated 3pts q/q to +19% in Q1 (slowing in China, steady in RoW).

AAPL's balance sheet is a fortress, so the stock deserves a safety premium at a time like this. But at \~17x forward earnings and the risk of delayed discretionary spending, it's hard to get very excited about the stock right now.",13,0.76
2021-02-12 10:08:51,The incentive to short TSLA is just massive at this point,"Ok guys, let's throw away the year-old arguments about valuations and  modelling and how TSLA's price is 10-20x what it should be even not  accounting for all the competition that it might have in the future.

At this point the only key measure to look at here is **market cap:**  we are looking at a $768B company, almost $1T. In case you haven't noticed, there aren't a lot of companies thare are worth significantly    more than that. Only  AAPL, MSFT, AMZN and Saudi Aramco thare are worth  more than double the price of TSLA, and they are all cash cows with massive amounts of actual real profits and fat margins, something that  Elon Musk doesn't have.

Even if TSLA stock rallied heavilyin the next months, it could as well double and go into the same league as those blue chips, but **REALISTICALLY,  it's not a 10 bagger potential ANYMORE: do you actually believe that  there would be LITERALLY TRILLIONS of dollars flowing into this stock?** Because to increase its price we need those numbers at this point.

Really  think about the people that could buy TSLA at this point, basically  everybody knows it's a massive bubble, and it's much easier to justify  taking  that massive risk if you know you could be in for a multibagger  upside wise, but  it's not easy given the relatively small upside of  today.

Having said all that,  there needs to be a catalyst. In the next few years, as competiton in  EV and autonomus driving space starts to thicken, we  might  finally see  a meltdown ...

**What do you guys think about this?**  I might be wrong and many hedge fund legends  have  lost billions  shorting this stuff, but at this point the poop smell is just too much.  Burry shorted this a couple of months back, he  predicted  2008, he  predicted Game Stop, he might be right on this  too.

2020-03-16 08:49:57,Sizing up $AAPL store closure impact,"AAPL has closed all of its retail stores outside of China, and at the same time reopened all its 52 stores in China. This implies \~90% of AAPL's 510 stores globally will be impacted until further notice.

Assuming \~$16m of retail sales per store in Q2, 13 weeks in the quarter, and retail sales representing \~12% of total revenue, 2 weeks of store closures outside China will impact AAPL sales by \~$1bn, or 1.5-2% of Q2 revenues.

With the situation in Europe and here in the US changing by the hour, store closures could extend beyond 2 weeks. The bigger medium term risk is a wider recession hurting consumer spending. Excitement for the 5G iPhone cycle should be put in context of a potentially deeper recession, during which such a discretionary purchase can be postponed.

That said I still want to generate income on the idle cash in excess of money market rates (nil). I don't want to touch bonds as rising interest rates will crush long durations bonds and short term bonds are also generating nil returns. Looking for suggestions but am leaning towards selling puts.

My thought is to sell July 2021 puts on AVGO, MSFT, AAPL, TSM. Setting strikes for 25-35% discounts on these stocks would get you a rough return of 3-4% annualized. Nothing spectacular but beats money markets. In the event the market crashes before July, I would be happy to buy any of these stocks at the discount.

Let me know if you have better suggestions for names to sell puts on (without excessive risk) or other strategies to generate yield. I'm not inclined to buy high dividend yield stocks as those will still get dragged down in a market correction and then you are stuck holding them until they recover. I'd rather generate yield now while remaining liquid so I'm in a position to bottom feed after a correction.",38,0.9

But if you ignored them and just held your positions, you would have earned 16.4%.

It's worth adding that the operation costs weren't included in that equation, as well as capital gain taxes.

My biggest problem when it comes to investing is trying to find that one gold advice, that would help me make 500% returns. On Reddit there's plenty of TSLA yay and nay sayers, AMZN fanatics and opponents, AAPL fan boys and haters who will try to convince everyone around why their opinion is the most valid and accurate. 

Fuck 'em. Do your own research. Look at the company earning reports. Look at the political climate and try to deduce how the company may react to it. Commit and don't look back.

2021-02-28 00:05:21,Why Forward and TTM PE ratios have become increasingly irrelevant in today's environment," 

**Forward PE ratios are not real-** I'll start with forward PE because it is one of the most frustrating ratios. When you look at forward snp500 PE ratios on Yahoo finance or Macrotrends, you are comparing actual forward earnings, to estimated forward earnings. Here is a fun statistic, 80% of snp500 companies beat q4 2020 earnings. Let me emphasize this, \*\*forward earnings are always wrong\*\*. The deviation varies, but it is not the correct number. In this market condition, we are clearly in a phase where the market is pricing higher than expected 2021 earnings. This may be because of a faster than expected vaccine, more than expected stimulus, or maybe just irrationality… but it is expecting higher earnings. So when you are comparing historical forward PE to current, it’s not correct.

**Lower interest rates**\- Yes, this is an obvious narrative that has been pushed by the bulls for months now, but it has some truth to it. Lower interest rates mean a lot of things for companies. They can take on new debt or refinance current debt for lower interest rates, which means more money to invest in themselves for growth, or return more cash flow back to shareholders. Lower interest rates also have an effect on buy and sell-side analyst price targets. When modeling a price target, many analysts use discounted cash flow models or equity risk premiums to discount forward earnings to a present value. When interest rates are lower, the risk-free rate is, obviously, lower, which equates to a lower equity risk premium, hence, a higher price target. What else do higher interest rates mean? More spending from the average consumer. More debt is taken out- which is seen by historically high inflation-adjusted margin in stocks and record new home sales - which leads to more spending, which trickles down to the bottom line for snp500 companies, making trailing twelve-month earnings pretty irrelevant. If comparing historical pe ratios was a science experiment then the price would be a plant, sunlight would be earnings. We would be comparing the growth of plants v sunlight. In this experiment, we would want to keep all other factors constant, like room temperature, time spent exposed to sunlight, amount of soil, etc. But in our funky, weird, irrational, science experiment we are changing the amount of soil (interest rates), and here is the funniest part, people call it investing.

**The makeup of the snp500 companies**\- Another good reason historical PE ratios really mean nothing is that the quality of earnings has been pretty dramatically increasing. Over the past 7 years, the FANG % share of the snp500 market cap has gone from about 3.5% to around 12%, adding about a 1.7 forward earnings difference attributable to the FANG names. But, even this does not tell the full story. A significant makeup of the snp500 market cap is high growth names- relative to the snp500 earnings growth- not mentioned in that last example. Examples are Tesla, Amazon, Visa, Disney, Nvidia, Mastercard, Paypal, etc… It’s very easy to justify the snp500’s rather rapid rise of P/E ratio over the last decade by just the quality of earnings. These large-cap companies are taking away business from small, not snp500 companies. Which is a large factor in why the economy suffered in 2020 but Q4 2020 earnings were positive Y/Y. Another key point is that P/E ratios do not tell the full story for many companies. Amazon trades at a 90 PE, Tesla trades at a 1000 PE, Nvidia trades at 70 PE, NFLX 80, PYPL 70. Why? Because they have pretty significant 5-year earnings growth rates.

**The rise of intangibles**\- Companies are increasingly being valued by assets not realized by GAAP metrics. Intangible assets are one of the reasons price to book value has been a horrible performer the past 10 years. Companies are increasingly spending money on certain technologies that are producing 0 cash flows but will produce serious amounts of cash flow in the future. Let me give a good example. Tesla CEO Elon Musk stated on the 2020 Q4 earnings call “We are in preliminary talks to license autopilot”. Currently, autopilot is a free option producing 0 cash flow but has required significant CAPEX to create. We know this is an asset to Tesla and will create cash flow into the future. Autopilot, arguably, is producing earnings for the company right now, since it’s a selling point on their main products. But this does not show up on any income statement or balance sheet. This is simply an example to show how GAAP metrics do not do justice to many companies. An example like this can be pulled out of almost any snp500 company. 

**Stock buybacks-** SNP500 company’s buybacks basically fell through the floor in 2020. There is a quite obvious reason why this happened, a ton of uncertainty in the economy so companies temporarily suspended stock buybacks. As we all know, stock buybacks artificially increase EPS since the company is retiring shares, just like secondaries artificially decrease EPS since it’s dilutionary. Stock buybacks are expected to not only pick up in 2021 but expected to accelerate to historical highs. Making TTM PE ratio's not telling the full story on stock prices.

**PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS-** This statement is a disclaimer on almost every, 10k, 10q, institutional note, and blog post. But investors seem to take that philosophy and throw it out the window when it comes to price ratios. If you had looked at historical earnings ratios in May 2009, you would have sold all your stocks and crawled under a rock. Since then we have missed the greatest bull market in history. If you would have looked at historical PE’s in 2014, you would have said to yourself, the market is overvalued, I will sell and wait for a dip. Well, in that time, you would have to wait 4 years for a 20% decline and get this, you would be paying a 40% premium, not including dividends gained. A 20 PE ratio today does not mean it won't be 30 in the future. 

**A number without context should mean 0 to you-** One of the most well-known philosophies in investing is to not chase yield. A higher yield almost always means higher risk. If it didn’t, everyone would be buying 10% dividend-yielding stocks, not realizing earnings have a higher risk of falling, or maybe debt payments are starting to drown the company, etc. And the same vice versa, nobody is selling Microsoft because it is paying a lower dividend relative to the snp500. MSFT is just a higher quality company with a lower payout ratio. This logic should be applied to PE ratios as well. A low PE ratio should almost be alarming. Stocks like Walgreens or Abbvie trade around 10x forward earnings while Microsoft and Apple trade at around 30x forward earnings. Does this mean we should go and sell MSFT and AAPL to buy WBA and ABBV because it’s a 3x better deal based on pe? No. This is not financial advice saying to buy or sell any of these companies. I'm a fan of all 4 of these companies, I’m just making a point that not contextualizing why these companies have different earnings multiples leaves you ignorant of your investments.",7,0.66

Each is under 5 years old with an ER of 0.29%, each had a regularly scheduled rebalance just a day ago (so it's a good time to evaluate holdings), and each makes novel contributions to the factor ETF space.

&#x200B;

1. **FCPI, Fidelity Stocks for Inflation ETF:** [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FCPI](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FCPI)

Methodology here: [https://research2.fidelity.com/pi/Content/Documents/RebalanceSchedulesPDFs/Fidelity%20Stocks%20For%20Inflation%20Factor%20Index%20Methodology.pdf](https://research2.fidelity.com/pi/Content/Documents/RebalanceSchedulesPDFs/Fidelity%20Stocks%20For%20Inflation%20Factor%20Index%20Methodology.pdf)

Described on page 5 of the methods doc, the ETF tracks an index that screens for value, quality, and momentum of stocks (a set of 11 total metrics, which I like for inflation protection due to the emphasis on free cash flow).  However, it also slightly biases sector weights (5% each) depending on historical correlation of sector performance with inflation.  So you get more weight on commodities-centric stocks, fewer tech and consumer discretionary stocks, etc (see page 7 of methods).  Its performance in the past year hasn't been amazing (it has been like VTV), but, inflation concerns did not really ramp up until very recently.  Also, the ETF index was reconstituted effective Monday, February 22 (see methods).  So if it's going to outperform a total market ETF, it's set up for it right now.  This is a small ETF by AUM and volume, so keep an eye on bid/ask spreads if you're dipping into it, but man, super appealing right now!

Having a look inside, you need to examine the daily holdings document since it was rebalanced more recently than the end-of-January summary holdings.  That's here: [http://fundresearch.fidelity.com/prospectus/eproredirect?clientId=Fidelity&applicationId=ETF&securityId=316092386&securityIdType=CUSIP&critical=N](http://fundresearch.fidelity.com/prospectus/eproredirect?clientId=Fidelity&applicationId=ETF&securityId=316092386&securityIdType=CUSIP&critical=N) .  Top 10 holdings currently include:

AAPL, MSFT, EQT, WMB, EXP, NEM, CC, PG, GOOGL, PM.  Thus, it's heavy on free-cash-flow tech, oil/gas, materials, and consumer staples.

2. **FVAL, Fidelity Value Factor ETF**: [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL)

Methodology here: [https://research2.fidelity.com/pi/Content/Documents/RebalanceSchedulesPDFs/FMR\_US\_Value\_Focus\_Methodology\_publicFNL.pdf](https://research2.fidelity.com/pi/Content/Documents/RebalanceSchedulesPDFs/FMR_US_Value_Focus_Methodology_publicFNL.pdf)

Many ""value factor"" ETFs have a near-exclusive focus on price/book ratio and earnings (or sales) to price.  This one is different in that is specifically calls out free cash flow yield and earnings to enterprise value metrics, which are also metrics that DSTL (the ""Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF"", another modern value/quality ETF @ [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl)) weights highly.  In fact, these value metrics are also used as the ""value"" metrics for FCPI. FVAL is not a simple ""value or growth"" classifier like some S&P or CRSP value/growth factor ETFs.  It has consistently outperformed Vanguard's value ETF, VTV, probably as a result of using methods that can better reflect the effects of intangible value.  It was also rebalanced effective Monday, Feb. 22.  I think that this is the sort of ETF that may also outperform the market if meme growth tech stocks stagnate or there is mild inflation.

Its top holdings do include free-cash-flow tech starting with S&P 500 stalwarts AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL and FB.  Many ""value"" ETFs will not be holding those tech leaders!  But after that that, FVAL takes a bit of a turn; one thing you won't find in either FVAL or FCPI is Tesla.  But FVAL does have classic value stocks such as Berkshire Hathaway and JNJ in its top 10.

The indices reflected the tech dominance. The DJIA rose just 183 or 0.6% to 30,997, the S&P gained 1.9% to 3,841 but the tech heavy NASDAQ composite jumped 4.2% to 13,543, its biggest gain since the week ended Nov 6th.

The post-election rally of cyclical, value and small cap stocks was built on stimulus hopes and the reflation trade from the Blue sweep; it didn't see as much participation from big tech. When reality sank in that the massive stimulus bill was not going to be easily passed in the senate, the cyclical rally hit a pause -- suddenly tech was looking cheap, and NFLS’s earnings post market on Tuesday lit the fire. Interest rates too held steady – the 10 year closed around 1.10 and didn’t douse the fire.

**What lies ahead?** 

Next week is a very busy week with 20% of the S&P expected to report earnings. I do expect the tech rally to continue, though not at the same blistering pace; many will sell on news and take profits. I own all the FAAMNG’s and will sell small portions to book some profits. However, they remain a fairly large part of my portfolio and barring anti-trust government action, I don’t see any secular threats. 

I’m still bullish on cyclicals, value and small caps. I bought Toyota Motors, (TM), General Motors (GM) and Ford (F), besides increasing positions in US Foods (USFD) and Performance Group (PFGC). The autos deserve some of Tesla’s sunshine - sure they’re far behind in technology and branding but the gap is too wide and presents opportunity. I like USFD and PFGC, they’re food distributors and post vaccination and lifting of lockdowns – people will release their pent up demand for eating out.

2020-04-15 10:33:15,$AAPL - some early data on App Store trends through COVID,"According to checks by Morgan Stanely this week, app downloads in the Mar quarter is up \~25% y/y (strongest since 2015) likely helped by stay-at-home measures against COVID-19. However, consumers also appear to be less willing to spend on the incremental apps, with revenue per download down \~5% y/y.

Interestingly, China appears to be leading the slowdown in the net revenue per download, with its net revenue growth slowing from 32% in Jan, to 14% in Feb, and 3% in Mar, even as download volume increased 30% y/y for the quarter. China's App Store's net revenue per download is down 11% y/y, a sharp reversal from the 32% y/y growth in the Dec quarter. Outside of China, the rest of the world performed well, with net revenue growth accelerating to 20% y/y in the Mar quarter, compared to 18% in the Dec quarter.

Overall, Service revenue appears set to beat for the Mar quarter. But since China had nearly a full quarter of the COVID-19 impact, it could be an early indicator of the App Store's softer performance for rest of world in the Jun quarter. In any event, the likely bigger drivers for the stock will continue to be COVID's potential impact (or lack thereof) on product timing (i.e. 5G iPhone cycle) and consumer demand.",2,0.75

Could you guys name publicly traded companies that match the following?:

1. Preferably, founder-led publicly traded company
2. (required) The company's product(s) and service(s) have SERIOUS / LOTS OF fans. Fanatic investors, consumers, or supporters - or all of the above.
3. (required) The founder has a cult-like following/ garners respect and hate from investors and users alike. If the non-founder CEO has a cult-like following, that counts, too.
4. Preferably, a consumer tech company; open to B2B tech as well and other non-tech consumer-facing companies.
5. Preferably, founded after 1999.
6. Can be Japanese, Chinese, American or European listed companies.

Context: I want to bet on companies with halo effect derived from hype. From retail investors to institutional investors to customers alike. Going to leave financial fundamentals behind a bit in 2021. No SPACs, unless the target is a company that fits the above criteria.

Here are one that I think fits the above:

Watching AAPL drop 25% over the past month had me thinking it was now ""cheap"" and a good deal to start buying but according to this PE [CHART](https://imgur.com/a/RgmmL37) it's stock price to earnings is still near 2-year highs and appears to be above average over the past 8-9 years.   So relative to itself, AAPL does not appear cheap here.  



So then I started thinking, maybe AAPL is cheap relative to the index (Nasdaq) in this case.  Here is a 10 year chart showing AAPL's share price is still up 100% relative the Nasdaq.  [Chart Link](https://imgur.com/a/uO5Ayeh)   Again, AAPL does not yet look cheap.  

&#x200B;

Finally I thought maybe AAPL's PE at around 14 is ""cheap"" relative to all market PEs over the past 30 years.  This [Chart](https://imgur.com/a/RzgqUCU) shows AAPL's PE (red x) relative to S&P500 historic PEs over the past 30 years.   So here AAPL is actually start to look like a good buy as investors are paying less per earnings relative to the market average.  

&#x200B;

To me the first two charts show AAPL as being at least fair or average priced right now relative to itself and the last chart shows it to be at a discount relative to the rest of the market.      Am I doing this right or can anyone offer some insight here.  

  
Thanks.

That's up from the $5.1B of stock the conglomerate bought in Q2.

Q3 operating earnings of $5.48B vs. $5.51B in Q2 and $8.07B in the year-ago quarter.

The only major business segment to see a Y/Y  increase in operating earnings was railroad, utilities and energy, while  insurance underwriting posted a loss vs. a year-ago profit. (updated at  8:18 AM).

Losses and costs associated with COVID-19  negatively hurt its commercial insurance and reinsurance underwriting  results; furthermore, future judicial rulings and regulatory and  legislative actions relating to insurance coverage and claims may affect  future results.

""Our underwriting results for the remainder of  2020 and the first quarter of 2021 for certain business may be adversely  affected from lower premiums attributable to credits granted to  policyholders and where premiums are a function of the insured’s  payroll,"" the company said in its 10-Q.

Operating earnings by segment:

* Insurance underwriting: loss of $213M vs. earnings of $440M a year ago.
* Insurance - investment income: $1.02B vs. $1.48B a year ago.
* Railroad, utilities and energy: $2.74B vs. $2.64B a year ago.
* Other businesses: $2.35B vs. $2.46B a year ago;
* Other: loss of $412M vs. earnings of $1.05B a year ago.

&#x200B;

Q3 net earnings of $30.1B vs. $26.3B in Q2 and  $16.5B a year ago; investment gains fell to $24.8B vs. $31.0B in Q2 and  rose from $8.7B a year ago.

Insurance float was \~$135B at Sept. 30, 2020, vs. \~$131B at June 30, 2020.

[ The company had \~$145.7B of cash, equivalents and short-term investments as of Sept. 30](https://berkshirehathaway.com/qtrly/3rdqtr20.pdf?source=news_body_link), 2020, just under the $146.6B it had at June 30.

About 70% of Berkshire's  investments in equities securities' aggregate fair value at Sept. 30  was concentrated in four companies with Apple (NASDAQ:[AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL?source=news_body_link)) by far the biggest, at $111.7B. The others are Bank of America (NYSE:[BAC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAC?source=news_body_link)) at $24.9B, Coca-Cola (NYSE:[KO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KO?source=news_body_link)) at $19.7B, and American Express (NYSE:[AXP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AXP?source=news_body_link)) at $15.2B.

At Dec. 31, 2019, its investments in those four  companies represented 60% of aggregate fair value — $73.7B for AAPL,  $33.4B for BAC, $22.1B for KO and $18.9B for AXP.

Digging further down into Berkshire's 10-Q filing  and the company's unit results, its railroad, BNSF saw earnings before  income taxes slip to $1.78B vs. $1.94B in Q3 2019, primarily due to  lower volumes because of the pandemic.

Berkshire Hathaway Energy's earnings before income taxes increased to $1.12B from $1.06B a year earlier.

Manufacturing earnings before income taxes fell to  $2.26B from $2.48B, and service and retailing earnings before income  tax increased to $779M from $639M.

McLane Company saw earnings before income taxes nearly double Y/Y to $96M from $50M.

2. services growth (often touted to justify AAPL's premium multiple) slowed to 17% y/y vs. 20% y/y last quarter.
3. AAPL already closed a store in Wuhan and traffic appears light in several Chinese cities. F'Q2 guidance beat, but still could see a $4B swing in revenues from the coronavirus outbreak.
4. the stock has moved pretty much vertically upwards lately.

In short, the stock seems ripe for some profit-taking near term.

But looking beyond the near term noise, AAPL's long-term fundamentals clearly continued to strengthen as the company broadens its ramp for consumers to get into the Apple ecosystem lock-in. For instance, active AAPL devices grew 7% to 1.5B devices, and subscribers were up 120m y/y to 480m on Dec 31, 2019, which is 9 months ahead of plan.

The near term noise may be sounding a growing sell signal, but timing the market has never been easy. If the stock is a good one long-term, better to just look through the noise and stick with it until the fundamentals no longer justify it.",2,0.75

I expect AAPL to keep growing so I am keen to hold, though I’m very aware of not having a majority of a portfolio in one company. 

In this situation, would you look to sell AAPL with no CTG and invest into an ETF knowing there is no CGT upon sale of the AAPL stock?

2020-12-21 04:10:51,Comparing YHOO AND TSLA,"Hi all

So now that TSLA is in the S&P let’s compare 

YHOO(1999) was part of the dotcom bubble, a bubble fuelled by the (in hindsight) mostly accurate assumptions that (a) cost of internet is going down (b) user count is going up (c) margins for profit are extremely good (d) economy of scale on the net is infinite. This lead to the assumption that YHOO and its ilk could potentially have a user base of [the world] and hence reap profits from 7bn users for essentially no cost of revenue. (900 PE valuation)

TSLA(2020) is part of the EV/disruptive tech bubble, a bubble fuelled by the speculation that growth of these disruptive industries can in some unspecified way achieve global dominance over existing market leader under the changing climate of (e)environmental policy, (f)government attitudes, and (g)exponential technical development. Unfortunately unlike YHOO it has a high base cost of revenue (manufacturing, research, retooling) and may run into the diseconomies of scale barrier that stymied the growth of many other physical goods companies due to a inherently high retail value of goods sold being a barrier to entry for new users. Arguably its one standout feature is (h)vertical integration something that has historically been successful during the early 1900s seen most prominently in the Trust monopolies (1300PE)

While YHOO and it’s Ilk fell precipitously other new companies that survived the tech bubble collapse (GOOGL, AMZN, FB, MSFT, AAPL, BABA) actually achieved the stated goal of (a-d) and became the largest market leaders seen since The AT&T and early 19th century Trust monopolies.

Are we looking at the next wave of companies coming into existence meeting the e-h criteria that will take over the world? Or is TSLA another canary set to die in the coal mine without any impact.

* DK is an exciting, disruptive company working to change how we experience watching sports and make it better.
* I am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice. These are just my opinions to help facilitate learning and discussion.

Hi everyone, thanks for coming back for Part 2. If you missed Part 1, you can read it [here.](https://onthemarkpicks.com/2020/11/30/deep-dive-1-part-1-of-2-draftkings-bringing-sports-to-life/comment-page-1/#comment-1) I’m excited to bring you the rest of my research on DraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG). Let’s dive in.

**Can we 10X from here?**

For someone like me that is on the younger side and with a longer investment time horizon, and probably you if you are reading this, an important question to ask yourself is “Do I think this investment could 10x from here?”. In other words, could this investment one day be 10 times what it is worth today? To try to answer this question, I will work through a pre-determined framework that I believe gives us the best path to find out.

The framework includes:

1. Leadership – Desire, Purpose and Ownership
2. Risk Considerations
3. Price Considerations
4. Explosive Business Growth

**1. Leadership – Desire, Purpose, Ownership**

For a company to do something as spectacular as 10x, we are going to need to see really strong and talented leadership. In Chris Mayer’s excellent book “100 Baggers”, he dedicates a part of the book to talk about the importance of what he calls “Owner Operators”. By this he means that the CEO of the company owns a substantial amount of stock in the company themselves. Why is this important? If the CEO has their own personal wealth at stake in the company’s stock (just like we do as shareholders) their interests are more aligned with shareholders and maximizing returns for shareholders than they would be if that CEO had no skin in the game. It’s also better in my opinion if the CEO of the company was also the founder of the company. For these founder-CEO’s that have money invested in their own company, it really is like their baby. Would you rather have your money invested with someone who views the company as their baby or with someone who was just hired to watch this kid (the company)?

Having one founder in leadership is good, but how about three? You have to love that. These guys worked together to start this company 8 years ago, and today they hold the three highest positions within the company. Jason, Matt, and Paul were all co-workers at Vistaprint in 2012. Vistaprint is a global e-commerce company that produces physical and digital marketing products for small and micro businesses. All three of them studied computer science/engineering in college with Matt and Jason picking up an additional majors in business/economics. This makes sense as Matt and Jason are CEO and President while Paul is head of Global Technology and Product. At Vistaprint, they worked in various analytics and marketing roles and became good friends. They had a passion for fantasy sports. They liked season long fantasy sports, but saw a big opportunity in daily fantasy sports. They went to work right away on building a digital platform for daily fantasy sports from a spare bedroom in Paul’s Watertown, Massachusetts apartment. Talk about humble beginnings.

I think that Founder/CEO Jason Robins has really shown that he can take care of his baby and lead it to big wins. Over the past 8 years, he has successfully lobbied in multiple US states for legalization of DFS and sports betting. He has helped DK obtain key partnerships with major sports leagues including becoming the official DFS partner of the NFL in 2019. At the time of the deal, Jason was quoted in an article in the Legal Sports Report by Eric Ramsey as saying:

“Throughout our discussions with the League, it was evident we share a common vision around the future of fan engagement, and we are excited to continue on this unique journey with the NFL as our ‘Official Daily Fantasy Partner” and calling it “a defining moment” for the industry.

It’s very important that the CEO of a company like this, trying to essentially create a new industry in the United States, is tactful at getting deals done with key business partners and lobbying for change with the government. I believe this bodes well for DK’s future.

Also, Jason is very respected and admired by his employees. On Glassdoor, he has  a 99% approval rate. I’ve honestly never seen a CEO with an approval rating that high. I think this strongly corroborates my thesis that he is a great leader.

Also, DraftKings has very happy customers. Using Net Promoter Score (NPS) which is one of the most reliable and unbiased ways to find out what a customers true experience with a business is and how likely they would be to recommend it to a friend. For DK, their NPS is extremely high and is substantially better than their main competitor – FanDuel. On a scale of -100 to 100, DK has a 71 NPS, while FanDuel has a 54. This is a testament to leadership’s commitment to creating a great user experience. It really shows that company leadership can follow up on their word and deliver what they promise.

In terms of leadership, owning their company, Jason owns about 4.3% of the company worth about $880 million at the time of this writing. Fellow co-founders Matthew Kalish and Paul Liberman both own about 1.8% of the company, with their stakes each worth about $350 million. I think it’s fair to say that these guys are invested in the success of the company that they started and are motivated to grow their company’s worth for themselves and shareholders.

**2. Risk Considerations**

My investing strategy is to buy companies of high quality, that are growing at a rapid pace, and then hold my position in those companies for a long time (5, 10, 15 years or longer) as long as I continue to stay satisfied with that companies’ ability to execute their business plan and have productive quarters that meet or exceed expectations. It’s not “Buy and Hold”. It’s “Buy and Continuously Verify”. If you are going to take this strategy, you have to understand the difference between risk and volatility.

To me, risk is the possibility that I can lose my entire investment. As long as I am not trading on margin (I don’t) or short selling (I don’t) the most I can possibly lose when I buy stock in a company is 100% of my money. The risk I’m taking on is 100%. But what is my upside? Is my upside limited to 100%? Of course not. I can invest $10,000 into a company and it can grow to $100,000 (1,000%) or it can grow to $1,000,000 (10,000%). There’s really no limit. Volatility is a natural side effect of being a rapidly growing, disruptive company, that at times the public may struggle throwing a valuation on. It’s your ability to sit through these wild price swings while maintaining conviction in the company’s long term prospects that will allow you to possibly experience a 10x or maybe even a 100 Bagger.

Can we completely eliminate risk? No. But I do think there’s ways we can go about reducing it with our investments. Before considering a company for investment, I have a list of a few questions I go through to see if there’s any red flags that I think could make the investment too risky for me.

*Question 1: Is the market cap under $1B?*

No. DK’s market cap is $20.5B. Companies under $1B market cap are small/micro cap companies. Penny stocks fall in this category. To me, companies this small are riskier because they haven’t built up enough credibility to get big time financial backing, they’re less known by the public, and less scrutinized by the public than larger companies.

*Question 2: Is there one customer that accounts for over 10% of revenue?*

No. DK had 1,021,000 Monthly Unique Players (“MUPs”) during Q3 2020, which is up 64% YoY compared to Q3 2019. I seek to avoid customer concentration because if something goes wrong with that one customer or they lose them, it could have a materially negative impact on the business. Luckily, with DK we don’t have to worry about this.

*Question 3: Is the company a turnaround story that was recently struggling?*

No. DK was founded 8 years ago (2012) and has been on an upward trajectory ever since. As a matter of fact, DK was founded 3 years after FanDuel (2009) and did a great job of not only catching up to them but surpassing them on many metrics. I’ve used both and can honestly say I enjoy DK a lot more. Since they were listed on the NASDAQ on April 24, 2020 the stock is already up 160% from around $19.

*Question 4: Is the company in an industry that is set to decline?*

No. I don’t think I need to write too much about this. Ultimately, DK is a digital entertainment platform. Common sense should tell you that’s a good industry to be in right now.

**3. Price Considerations to 10x**

In this part of the framework, I want to focus on the price and the path to 10x from the current price. As of this writing (11/30/20), the market capitalization (market cap) of DK is $20.5B. For those of you that are new investors, I’ll give you a quick breakdown of what this means.

Market cap = Shares outstanding \* Price per share

So if Company X has issued 1,000,000 shares, and each share is trading at $50, the Market cap of Company X would be $50M. For reference, this would be a very small company (a micro-cap) that you or I have probably never heard of.

The market cap tells you the total value of the company as a whole on the stock market today.

To achieve 10x in 10 years, a stock will need to have a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of approximately 26% per year on average for each of those 10 years. This would obliterate the S&P 500 which has averaged roughly 13.5% per year the past 10 years.

Now back to DK. In order for DK to 10x in 10 years from this current point ($20.5B) it will have to reach a market cap of roughly $205B by the year 2030. For reference, Disney (DIS), has a market cap of $268B as of today. Disney might be a good investment, but they’re not going to be worth $2.68 trillion dollars in the next 10 years. Size of the company matters when trying to 10x. For reference, the highest valued company in the world right now is Apple (AAPL) at $2 trillion.

Disney is considered the gold standard of the entertainment industry. But keep in mind, Disney’s position in entertainment is well established and if anything, would really be declining in the current macro environment if not for their Disney+ streaming service. Even one of the oldest leaders in entertainment like Disney realizes the value of having a digital entertainment platform. However, with the Disney story being very mature and in it’s golden years, the DK story is in the early innings. Better yet, to quote DK CEO, Jason Robbins from the Q3 earnings call, the sports betting part of DK’s business is “in spring training”. For those of you who don’t follow baseball, “spring training” means that the season has not even started yet. The entire premise of DK as a company in my mind is that they are a digital entertainment platform. With the current world macro environment including the immediate and long term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, I believe digital entertainment platforms (especially ones where you can win money) are primed for success. I know it’s a bold prediction to say a stock is going to 10x in 10 years but I believe DK does have a long enough runway for that type of growth to occur. Speaking of growth, let’s talk about that a little more.

**4. Explosive Business Growth**

We’ve talked about the path for the stock price to 10x, but a necessary ingredient for that to possibly happen is explosive growth. I like to see that top-line revenue is expected to grow at least 20% for the next five years. It’s this type of growth that makes companies that appear very expensive today, actually not as expensive as they look. Personally, when I’m evaluating a growth stock, the first thing I look at is the Price to Sales ratio (P/S). The formula for this is simple:

Price to Sales Ratio (P/S) = Market cap / Last 12 months of Revenue

For DK, the current P/S ratio is $20.5B / $550M\* = 37\*

\*To get $550M, I took Pro Forma Jan 1 – Sep 30 Revenue of $320M and added projected Q4 revenue of $230M from the Q3 earnings call.

To be fair, a P/S ratio of 37 is quite high. It means that as a shareholder, you are paying $37 for every $1 of revenue the company generates. And that’s before considering expenses. You might be saying, “Mark, that’s outrageous, why the heck would I pay $37 just to make $1 of sales?”. The answer is one word – growth. By taking a stake in DK today for the long term, you’re essentially banking on two things.

&#x200B;

1. Revenue will grow rapidly over the next few years to      make this ratio more reasonable
2. Investors in the future will still be willing to pay a      premium to have a stake in DK (maybe not a premium as high as $37 for $1      of sales, but a premium nonetheless).

In terms of explosive growth, it has been so far, so good for DK. In the most recent quarter (Q3) ending 9/30/20, revenue was $133M which is up 42% from the same quarter in the prior year. Analysts are expecting a similar trend to continue over the next five years, they forecast at least 20% growth each of the next 5 years.

If the market cap stays exactly the same as it is today ($20.5B), then the P/S ratio by the end of 2025 will be roughly 7. That is a lot more reasonable than what you see today at 37. However, the market cap is not going to be exactly $20.5B by the end of 2025. Too many things will have happened by then (hopefully mostly good things) for the company’s worth to be exactly what it is today. With all the runway for growth here, if management can execute, and actualize these impressive projected growth rates (or maybe exceed them?) I think investors will still be paying a high premium to have a stake in a company like DK.

Will investors still be paying a 37 P/S ratio five years from now? Probably not, but it’s interesting to look at what the company’s value would be if that were the case.

37 \* $2.8B sales = $104B.

I don’t think it’s realistic to think investors will still be paying that high of a premium, but maybe the premium will be somewhere between what it is today (37), and what it would be with no price change (7). This is me just speculating and guessing for fun, but lets take the mid-point of that range (22) and see where it gets us.

22 \* $2.8B sales = $62B.

This would be roughly a 300% return in 5 years under these assumptions with a CAGR of 25% per year. Not too bad! Again, take this part of the write up with a grain of salt as I am making a lot of assumptions and doing a lot of speculation here.

This concludes Part 2 of my DraftKings deep dive. Hope you enjoyed and be sure to stay tuned for the next pick and for any updates about this one!

\*\*\*POST-EDIT: Thank you all for the positive feedback! Please comment below what ticker you think I should do my next deep dive on? One with a similar runway for long term growth would be preferred!\*\*\*

2021-01-01 21:20:23,"Why Prosus NV stock (Euronext Amsterdam: PRX), almost 1/3rd owner of Tencent is a hidden gem","Prosus NV is a holding company mostly and a spinoff from South African holdings giant Nasper. And Prosus holds some companies that are poised to grow.

[Its portfolio. You must see this before reading further. And this image is all the information you need really to value the company.](https://imgur.com/a/ebv3sV6)

**The extreme discount**

So, let's do some maths. Prosus holds around 31% stake in Tencent maybe(I haven't checked recently if anything changed, but it shouldn't). So, Prosus's stake of Tencent is higher than $216B+ even after the sell-off from the Alibaba chinamama news cycle.

Yet the market is valuing Prosus stock at around $175B+. Now, Prosus's other holdings like Delivery Hero, PayU etc is surely not of negative value? Analysts put a valuation of around $30B for a collection of Prosus' e-commerce portfolio. But who knows.

I mean if all of them IPOed in this hot market, I can't even predict what their valuations will be. Analysts 

Management knows that this stock is being underpriced for stockholders and that's why they were almost forced to issue a buyback worth $5B just like the holdings company Berkshire Hathway (which is also a good way to own AAPL).

**Bull case**

1. But if anything, I see ALMOST all of Prosus's holdings growing significantly in the upcoming 10 years. I have done some extensive DD on some of their holdings(not all, I repeat). And I am extremely bullish on this holdings company because I think the management gets what sort of investments work in the 21st century. It's kinda like buying Ark ETFs with a margin of safety. Or kinda like buying a modern version of Berkshire Hathway. Whichever analogy fits your way.
2. Prosus is also quite heavily invested in China and India. I guess you know what that means.

[A starting point for further research on this company. (pdf)](https://www.prosus.com/getattachment/Investors/Overview/Naspers-and-Prosus-results-call-presentation_Sept2020.pdf.aspx?lang=en-US)

3.  Prosus is still not included in most of the European ETFs(where most investments go), when or IF   
it gets included, the discount between its book value and market value would probably decrease.

4. Almost no retail investor knows about Prosus. Spreading the pieces of information would definitely help increase its stock price. lol.

5. It's being said by some peeps(or shills) that the Euro and Yuan would gain against the Dollar for the next two-three years. Dollar has already declined a lot. *I am not sure if the dollar really would decline further but when enough people start to believe something that something may eventually become the reality; remember that OG mama printer Janet is coming to the office.* So, this stock could be a good way to hedge returns.

   6. Prosus' management is not insane like Softbank's management. Sure, they are also not as conservative as Berkshire. But if they were, they would have missed all the boats. They are somewhat middle in the risk spectrum between Berkshire and Softbank, which is my ideal management, really. Your cup of coffee may vary.

*Risks:*

1. I accept it. Prosus NV is currently just a roundabout way of buying Tencent holdings(which also partly owns JD, Mairuan etc) instead of buying it from the Hong Kong market. Sure, some of their holdings can keep on growing exponentially and indeed they will. But *right now,* Prosus is just owning Tencent. So if you hate Tencent (or China), avoid Prosus, by all means.
2. The bull case number 5 could actually turn into a bear case if the narrative surrounding the dollar changes.
3. The [holdings company discount](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conglomeratediscount.asp) could continue to widen or remain high for lack of enthusiasm, market float etc.",23,0.79
2021-01-09 06:24:34,The future of the big 5 US tech companies,"I read an article a while ago, that the big 5 tech companies GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, FB and AAPL fear regulations of data protection and security. They all gather big data and are exposed to regulations of the whole world through their global activities.

Europe already set the path for more regulations with GDPR and I believe it will extend. Companies will be forced to monitor and report more details to their activities and audits will cost them millions in administration.

The US, after the whole disaster going on with Trump, his followers and whatever other groups spreading misinformation, will for sure consider further regulations in the next 2 years.

I work in finance, and I see what administrative overhead regulations create. They make development expensive and slow. So I wonder if the big 5 will remain being longterm sure return investments or if this could be the beginning of a slow decline.

What are your thoughts on that?",5,0.62
2020-09-01 11:38:18,Apple's Market Cap reaches 2.3 Trillion - twice what was in April 2020 (1.1).. - Too big to fail? Too much faith?,"I briefly talked yesterday about Tesla's market cap and how it was absurdly priced and honestly felt like gambling to me. However, APPL is somewhat overlooked as well and I wanted to hear your guys' thoughts on it!

Apple's Market Cap as of right now is 2.3 Trillion ([Source](https://ycharts.com/companies/AAPL/market_cap)). On August 20, it was 2 Trillion. It has added 300 billion in about 10 days - without having added any products what soever (primarily due to the stock split).

In April of this year, it was 1.1 Trillion or so. It has since doubled since that time, so much so that it is the size of the GDP of France ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/685925/gdp-of-european-countries/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/685925/gdp-of-european-countries/))

Now, I am all for Apple devices and services. They make some of the best products ever. They have crazy high margins and once a consumer buys an Apple device, he has to buy other ones due to the seamless integration it provides (biggest selling point). It is now getting in more markets such as India with its' new iPhone SE 2, but I am somewhat skeptical on its' valuation.

I feel like people are buying AAPL due to its security - it has always gone up, so it will always go up - and therefore, it's safe to park their money there. Some are even likening it to Treasury Bonds - that it's better to put your money in AAPL stock because it's *safe* and because it's so big, it won't fail. 

I wanted to know if AAPL is overvalued/overpriced or not? I know the first 5G iPhone is coming out and it will have an impact but still, are people putting too much blind trust/faith in AAPL?

Without going into too much detail, it seems to me the obvious Lidar which Apple would purchase from is Aeva Lidar? And this is not only for their Apple car but also Apple iPhones.
The Aeva lidar is as small as a chip (hence the lidar on a chip name) which confirms to Apple design philosophy whereas other companies would get a flat out ""no"" (remember, Apple design teams run the company not the engineers). They are also cheaper and all around just ""better"" in terms of Lidar tech.

2020-10-07 09:04:06,"[Meta Thread] Re: ""can the mods stop locking threads""","Okay, I've been out of pocket the last few days and got to this one late, since there wasn't a lot of actual mod opinion/representation in that thread I've removed it and I'm starting one where we can actually express our views/stance.  The thread is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/j6c9hv/can_we_stop_locking_investment_related_threads/) should you wish to access it.  There's just no need for two meta threads in the same day, and the answer to the complaint is ""no"" anyway. 

I'm lifting this mostly from a comment I made there, but here's our general stance: 

> In the end I honestly think there is quite a bit of disconnect between the community and the mod team.

This probably won't be a popular opinion but this is both true and a new thing.  I've made no secret that I don't like what Reddit has become.  They have vastly expanded their cross sub algorithms, and Reddit as a whole has grown, given recent events this sub has seen an almost doubling in size over the last two years.    

I'm going to be direct because I'm not particularly worried about being popular here: **the vast majority of the new subscribers are not investors, have very little interest in investing, and don't have any background in investing.**  This is painfully obvious in that joke threads, off topic comments, etc are constantly the top voted comments in any given large thread.  So because they have no real interest in investing their comments tend to basically be the same as if they were in any given general news/politics/whatever subreddit.  Think about how much of the discussion in /r/economics or /r/technology has to do with economics or technology.  Is there a disconnect between the mod team and those users?  sure.  That's fine by me.   

If you want an investment community where the top comment on AAPL earnings thread is someone's comment about how they like their iphone because of imessage then yes, there is going to be  a disconnect between this sub's moderation team and you.  That isn't an /r/investing mod team problem, that is a subscriber issue.  

There seems to be this growing attitude on Reddit that subreddits are some democratic entity where users can override moderation if there's enough popularity.  That is not an accurate representation of how a sub is run, and should that be the case it would just quickly turn in to ""vaguely economic/public company related general discussion"" and not ""discussion on investing in capital markets and securities"".  This may be tough for some people to hear but as far as Reddit is structurally concerned a subreddit is an independent forum owned and controlled by it's moderators.     

So just to be clear: the policies in place, and the actions we take, are purposefully crafted to discourage people like the above from posting here.  I'm a blunt person as many of you know, I won't beat around the bush here; one regular contributor that actually discusses investing is more important to us than 1,000 subscribers who don't like our policies.  We are not catering to people who want to discuss anything they desire, and if they're upset by this then I apologize but there are other subreddits.  This is a place dedicated to investment discussion, you don't need to be a professional, expert, whatever to post here.  But you do need to discuss investing.  This is an extremely low bar, but in many cases hat bar is not being met. 

**Thread Locks**: if an entire thread is just political bickering, or off topic discussion it's getting locked.  We're not interested in micromanaging discussion, we are interested in just locking threads when people can't stay on topic.  I personally think it's a bit ridiculous that people expect mods to babysit a thread rather than just lock it when people can't stay on topic.  If people can't stay on topic that really tells us the thread probably isn't super relevant anyway.  And simply removing comments on a 500+ comment thread on the front page, where we average 300,000 pageviews per day and 100,000 unique pageviews per day, is trying to plug the hoover dam with Spez's dick.  It's an effort in futility.  

**Politics**: We used to discuss politics all the time, the choice to ban that was directly due to user behavior.  At some point after 2018 commenting here shifted from investment relevant opinions to something that can only be described as a debate between the lead editors for Bretbart and Vox, but dumber.  Compare [these](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/40usw0/bernie_sanders_002_percent_financial_transactions/) [threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/4a771n/bernie_sanders_proposed_tax_on_wall_street/) four years ago to [this thread last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cmyr9q/bernie_sanders_proposes_tax_of_under_onehalf/), both on the same exact subject.  As you can plainly tell the older one is far more topic centric than the newer one.    

Point is this forum is for investment discussion.  Politics and capital markets are certainly intertwined, but inevitably the new posters here are unable to discuss capital markets and just start talking about any given political opinion they have; then we get a thread indistinguishable from /r/politics.  If an entire thread is discussing the market ramifications of political regimes/policy then it's welcome here, that hasn't been the case in almost any thread over the last two years.  The 60 day bans for this sort of off topic behavior are deliberate in their length to encourage those people to find another subreddit to participate in.  ""I think Trump's proposal is bad for markets because of XYZ"" is totally relevant, ""I think Trump is a fat bad old man who hates minorities"" is totally a non relevant comment.  You may think it's true or false depending on which politics team you're on, but if you can't understand that it's irrelevant to investing then you shouldn't comment here. 


Our goal is fostering good investment discussion.  The goal is not to be a platform for political soapboxing, airing out grievances about corporations, have broad general discussion, or whatever else people want to do here.  That is not to say politics, corporate grievances, etc aren't important.  They're not part of this subreddit's purpose.  

Our goals also have nothing to do with activity, subscribers, or views/whatever.  The only thing we want is discussion that actually has to do with investing, and not whatever other subject people wish to try and relate back to investing.  If that means a bunch of people not here to discuss investing get mad and unsubscribe then that's a win.  To be frank many of our most knowledgeable regulars have stopped coming here because of the degradation in quality over the last two years.  This is not a condition we are happy with nor one we'd want to support.  

>From my experience talking to them it seems like a few senior mods have a very strong vision of what this sub should and should not be, and the quality of mods they are looking to recruit isn’t easy to come by.

Mods make a sub.  I think we're pretty open that we don't want a bunch of mods that want to make a sub that's just some lightly moderated general discussion outlet.  We want mods to come from our pool of regular quality contributors, not someone who's interested in being a mod for mod's sake, and not someone who mods a dozen other places.  The point is to have people in charge of something where they have vested interest in the quality of the sub.  I would absolutely love to add another 30 mods tomorrow, I can't think of anyone who wants the job and is also a good candidate but feel free to shoot us a modmail if you think you fit the bill.  I'd say this, if at least one of our existing mods doesn't recognize your username then it's probably gonna be a no.  

Here's the thing, if people don't like the rules then there are hundreds of other subreddits.  There's dozens of subreddits for politics, you can go over to /r/economics to see what a sub looks like when the mods aren't worried about removing low effort political discussion, and if that's appealing to you then you can comment there.  You can go to /r/latestagecapitalism or dozens of other subreddits if you just want to complain about public companies.  You can go to your political subreddit of choice for political discussion.  So again all of the new subscribers complaining about our efforts to remove those things don't really sway us, because we're not here for you and you have other outlets.  So we're not preventing anyone from having any sort of discussion they want to have, we're saying this isn't the sub for it.       

And finally if you would like to go to a subreddit for general discussion of **investing your money in to capital markets and securities** then you can hang here.  If ya want to talk shit about your least favorite corporation or politician then I think I speak for the entire mod team in saying we would prefer you went elsewhere.    

So TLDR: we have zero interest in creating a sub that allows for general off topic discussion, general political discussion, low effort political banter, or any of the other low effort joke/pun/anecdotes/whatever that you see across the majority of large subs.  This sub doesn't need to be all things to all people, and we have no interest in allowing more off topic conversation just because new users want it.  And if that means a sizeable portion of the subscribers, especially the more recent ones, are upset then that is a condition we are fine with.  The bar for discussion here is not high, it's literally just ""actually talk about investing"", so any degree of blowback concerning anyone on our team's moderation is really met by a high degree of cynicism from me given how broad that guideline is.",319,0.86
2020-12-15 07:47:42,Short Term Profit Taking Considerations,"Profit taking. You're up a large percentage and you're afraid that the market will take your profits away as it's done many times. You're also afraid of selling too early and watching your position rise shortly afterwards, like it's done many times. How can you decide whether to sell or hold? Well, here are **a few things to think about.**

1- Selling on the news- Some good news comes out for your position and your stock pops 6 percent in the premarket. Now you should consider selling. Why? Look at a recent examples- Boeing's positive 737 Max news on Nov 18th. There was a large buildup in price in the days prior. (buying the rumour) The stock opened much higher at 223 and ended the session around 203. Example 2- Pfizer's positive vaccine news yesterday. The market sold the covid recovery stocks on the news. Cruises, airlines, and hotels all got rocked.

2- When your position has run up an insane amount in a very short amount of time and may be due for a pullback. Example- snowflake- in 4 days this stock went from 280 to 429. Now it's trading at about 317 a few days later. Any big moves like this should be viewed with suspicion. Example 2- XPEV- After nearly doubling in about 3 trading sessions, the stock plummeted from 74.49 to a low of 42.84 over the next 11 trading sessions. Example 2- Big Tech's massive rally from March to September. It eventually got too hot and [corrected.](https://corrected.It) It's December now and MSFT AAPL AMZN and others still haven't recovered. (google is an exception).

Also note that big upward swings attract the attention of short sellers (think Citron and PLTr) and momentum traders just looking to pump and dump. When this happens, don't think of it as an investment. You should be pumping and dumping too. The bigger the top, the bigger the drop.

3- Going into earnings or some big event that could have a big effect, especially highly anticipated ones and ones that could possibly go wrong. Example- (SPCE) Virgin Galactic's failed space mission. It dropped about 16% or something afterwards.

4- When the uptrend in your position breaks. (technical analysis) Example- NIO- The uptrend broke around the 50 dollar mark. This happened a couple of days after the high of 57. About a week later, it reached its low of 38.43.

5-When your position changes to a consolidation period. (technical analysis) Example- Tesla- spent about 2.5 months consolidating from September to mid November. You would have been better off taking profits at a higher level of the range and either getting back in when Tesla broke out again, or buying back in at a low level of the range and just holding and waiting (for patient people) Example 2- Amazon and MSFT are still consolidating since September.

6-Consider selling when Goldman Sach's upgrades a stock.

**Please note**\- I understand that many of the buy and hold investors here will be offended. But I also know that profit taking is something that many people here are interested in doing better. As I am.

With profit taking, there may also a time to get back in. Example- if you got out of tesla during it's consolidation period, you would have rightly got back in when it broke out again.

With profit taking, you can try to get every dollar. But your focus should be on catching the big move. Worry more about catching the big move, rather than getting out at the very top. It's more efficient.

Obviously there are plenty of counter examples to what I've said. And I've cherry picked examples to express my point. However my point is that these are **things to consider** in profit taking, not any hard fast rules.

I'm not a professional and I don't have a lot of experience. I'm an amateur trader with a shorter term mindset who spends a decent amount of time trying to figure these things out.

There will still be many times when you sell too early or don't sell when you should. It's all part of the game. Don't beat yourself up too much and try to learn from it.

Good luck with your trading.",41,0.87

2020-11-29 03:30:17,"Have the rules of the ""game"" already changed?","Okay, I am aware that I might get a looot of downvotes on this one. But even if this happens, the idea of this post is to sparkle a good discussion and conversations. And I am just sharing my thoughts. You might also notice that I'm not someone, who has been investing for 20+ years, but rather than 2+.

Recently I finished reading ""The Intelligent Investor"". It was the newer version with comments after every chapter, which are referring to ""modern day"" examples (very helpful). Amazing book, without a doubt. I'd recommend it to everyone. I would even read it one more time at some point.

In a very very short summary, the book teaches the following things:

1. Always check the fundamentals: read the yearly reports of a company for at least the last past 5 years. Always read the reports back to forth, because in the back usually they put the information nobody wants to see (debt, losses etc.).
2. Don't buy a stock only, because it's overhyped.
3. Don't assume that stocks only go up. 
4. It's much safer to invest in index funds and ETFs than in individual stocks.
5. It's much safer to invest long-term than short or mid-term.
6. 6% to 10% returns per year is the key. If you are getting more, you are doing something wrong (because it would be an indication that it's too risky and could crash any moment).

Etc. etc. you get it. 

While and after reading the book, one question couldn't get out of my mind: 

**Is everything in this book still relevant today?**

Doing your own DD and learning the fundamentals of a company is here to stay forever. This is for sure and everybody should learn it.

But I have to admit, I didn't know anything about the stocks I bought so far. I didn't even check their websites. And I made around 25k since June 2020 (the first time in my life buying a single stock): financial gain which is crucial for my current situation in life. I was always following the ""herd-behavior"" in the sub-reddits and bought what everyone else bought: NIO, TSLA, PLTR, WKHS, KODAK, KNDI, MODERNA, GME etc. And yes, I paid a few more dollars in fees by selling and rebuying again short-time, in order to secure profits. 

**How is this different from the time-period when ""The Intelligent Investor"" was written?**

I was written in 1949. Back then people didn't have access to relevant information like now. Not even back then, but up until the mid-end of the 90s. Even through the beginning of the 2000s access internet was still being rolled out.

Using the investment advice from the book ""buy once and never sell for the next 40 years"" is absolutely relevant for the 40s, 50s, 60s etc. You literally didn't have any other choice, because of the extremely high broker fees and no access to real-time information.

**What about today?**

I have the feeling that the situation today is a bit different. Almost every broker on the internet has little to no fees. You can get real-time alerts by a simple setting in ""google alerts"". And of course, there is RobinHood, where every kid nowadays can buy and sell as much as he wants. And you have a little device in your pocket, where you can monitor and control your portfolio 24/7.

I have 2 ETF positions (S&P 500 and MSCI World) and I put monthly 200$ in them. It's been 2 years since I have them and I haven't touched them since. However, the gains are not so impressive compared to the stocks, which are being discussed here. 

I'm not going to sell my ETFs. However, I just have the feeling that I made good money exactly by NOT following the advices from the bible of investing ""The Intelligent Investor"". And of course, there is no guarantee that this will continue to happen in the future. I am just saying that holding ETFs for 2+ years and doing nothing haven't worked out for me so far, compared to concentrating on single stocks for short- and mid-term.

**Disclaimer:** this is not the result of a scientific study and is based solely on my own experiences with investing so far.   


* What are your experiences regarding long vs. short/mid-term?  

* Is there someone here, who is actually still holding an ETF or index fund since 10/20+ years and can share some thoughts on the feeling of having it?
* Is there someone here, making money ""stocks only""?
* What's your goal when you invest: saving for your retirement or enjoying life now?

This morning, I bought an AAPL $177.5/$180 call debit spread for $54 as it was the cheapest call I could afford to buy.

Sentiment has fallen below the 50 day average. Analyst Pierre Ferragu has predicted a fall in price due to lower iPhone sales. Will services revenue grow and prove him wrong?

I feel like they had a lot of momentum pushing them to break the $1T mark and they had a big quarter to help get themselves there. 
As noted in in the article below, Apple customers are upgrading their phones less frequently and it's been noted that big quarters are often followed by slower than expected quarters.
Here's the mentioned article: https://www.barrons.com/articles/why-apple-stock-could-be-in-for-a-clobbering-1534795589

I've had a lot of luck investing in some good stocks when I first got out of school a few years ago, but I've really struggled with knowing when to sell.  Just curious if you guys think AAPL is worth hanging on to or if this might be a good time to sell and reinvest elsewhere.",11,0.82
2020-12-04 16:41:23,Is AMZN the biggest player?,"I recently became very interested in outstanding shares and how the amount of shares can change for a stock over time. During the process, I charted AAPL, AMZN & MSFT for the last 15 years. I included share price, outstanding shares and assets into the charts (links below). 

All three companies experience exponential growth in their stock price as expected. What I find interesting is that Microsoft's outstanding shares have decreased in a somewhat linear fashion by roughly 30%. For Apple, outstanding shares increased slowly till around the time Steve Jobs died (figures) and then proceeds to decrease linearly for a total reduction of about 30% as well. On the contrary, AMZN has increased shares by 20% over the same period of time!

Now i'm curious what it all means?!

It's worth noting that AMZN's assets are seeing (what seems to be) exponential growth whereas microsoft is linear and apple when from a linear growth to a slight decrease for the past few years.

Is Besos creating that much more of a monster by creating shares consistently along the way so that the company has insane asset growth?

It makes sense that iphones sales should increase massively with 5G since everyone will want to upgrade.

2020-11-25 21:42:34,WHY to exit a position vs. WHEN to exit a position.,"**EDIT:** YES, I am aware that I would have lost out a ton if I had exited early out of TSLA, AMD, AAPL, etc..etc..etc.. This is true. I'd also like to say that I've lost a significant amount by not jumping out of these companies. Greed is a dangerous thing. That said, I realize that the missing element for me was having multiple portfolios. If you split cash up into YOLO-Aggressive, Aggressive and Retirement, then you'll have the mental space to work different strategies and risk options into your portfolio.

**EDIT 2:** Compounding is your friend, but can also be your enemy with losses.

**EDIT 3:** If you look at my post history you can see that my options calls anticipated a much higher return than 20% - those were strategies listed for my Ultra Aggressive portfolio. I still invested in them in my lower-risk portfolio, but had different exit points, and different investments (longer-term calls and stocks vs. short-term OTM calls).

&#x200B;

The question isn't \*when\* you should get out, its **why** you should get out.

Remember, the goal isn't 1 10x gain (though that's pretty amazing, right?!). The number of companies that see a 10x gain are < 1%. However, if you get out at say a 80% gain, you're looking at a significantly larger chance of that happening. If you're looking at a 20% gain then, many companies can give you that return.

**Understand what your end goal is and break it down on how you can get there. Run toward that dream instead of running away from whatever it is that you think money will help you escape from.**

So what's all this mean? Figure out where you're trying to get to. Want to turn 10,000 into 1,000,000?

You could hope for 1 stock that you're fully invested in generating a 100x (1000% return). Chances of that happening... minimal. Chances of that 10,000 turning into 15,000 (50%) return much better. Look, making 1,000,000 out of 10,000 is NOT easy. It's luck, timing, and to an extent skill and discipline.

If you want to make a million bucks out of a single win on a 10,000 investment, you need to find something that's going to generate a 10,000% return. Good freaking luck. But... do you think you could find opportunities that can generate a 20% return? Probably so. Yes, you'll need to do this 500 times, but if you don't think you have the time and discipline to to find 500 opportunities in 700 days (2 trading years)... I mean... take a step back and breathe... Of course 10,000% is possible - you'll see that in WSB all the time. But what you won't see are the other two types of people:

1. People who made that 10,000% return over several years. Guarantee you this group is larger than that # of people who generated a single 10,000% return on 1 investment.
2. People who lost it all chasing that 10,000% return who have no interest in sharing their pain for BS karma points.  Guarantee you that this group is significantly larger than group 1.

&#x200B;

**To put this all in perspective: Do you think you'd have an easier time of generating:**

\- 1 10,000% return or

\- 500 20% returns.

Put another way, do you think you could generate 1 20% return each day for the next couple years? It's not easy at all. But then again, if that's not very easy, then exactly how easy is generating 1, 10,000% return. And what happens if you lose your 10,000 on 1 investment that went south (cough...SPX weekly puts / calls)

**BEGINNING INVESTMENT:** $10,000

**EXPECTED OUTCOME:** $1,000,000

|\# of positive investment outcomes|% return required|Chances of this happening|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|10,000%|Really freaking low|
|10|1,000%|Really, really low|
|20|500%|still really low|
|50|200%|you've had a few of these I bet|
|100|100%|MSFT hands these out in the long run|
|200|50%|doable|
|500|20%|Really, really doable|

&#x200B;

**EDIT: A note about compounding.**

If you consistently re-invested your gains, you'd only need 25 successful outcomes. This is doable, but it's incredibly risky as you're assuming (much like I did above) that every investment leads to a 20% gain. If you were to put all your eggs into one basket then this is what compounding *looks* like.

**EDIT: A note about reality**

You're not going to consistently make 20% gains each investment. Some will be -5%, -25%, - 100% and others will be 5%, 20%, 100%, 400%. There are entire books, companies, funds etc...dedicated to figuring out how / when / who to invest in. I'm not going there. My point is not what you should invest in, but a reality check that turning 10,000 into a million is absolutely doable. If you go in knowing what it takes to get there, then you'll know **why** you need to sell a position (hint: so you can go on an re-invest that sum into another investment that is undervalued and hasn't yet returned what it's capable of returning)

Apple (NASDAQ:[AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL?source=news_body_link)) shares are down 3.7% AH following  fiscal Q4 beats on the top and bottom lines, offset by the downside  iPhone revenue, which was widely expected due to the pause in consumer  buying ahead of the delayed iPhone 12 launch.

Q4 revenue was up 1% Y/Y to $64.69B, $1.35B above consensus, and EPS of $0.73 topped estimates by $0.03.

Revenue breakdown: iPhone, $26.4B  (consensus: $27.73B); iPad, $6.8B (consensus: $6.14B); Mac, all-time  high of $9.03B (consensus: $7.93B);Wearables, Home and Accessories,  $7.9B (consensus: $7.23B); Services, all-time high of $14.5B (consensus:  $14.12B).

Overall gross margin was 38% (consensus: 38.1%).  Services margin was 67.2% (consensus: 66.5%) and Products came in at  29.7% (consensus: 30%).

""Our outstanding September quarter performance  concludes a remarkable fiscal year, where we established new all-time  records for revenue, earnings per share, and free cash flow, in spite of  an extremely volatile and challenging macro environment. Our sales  results and the unmatched loyalty of our customers drove our active  installed base of devices to an all-time high in all of our major  product categories. We also returned nearly $22 billion to shareholders  during the quarter, as we maintain our target of reaching a net cash  neutral position over time,"" says CFO Luca Maestri.

2020-11-12 02:26:40,Goldman Sachs has just boosted its S&P Target. Here's why," 

The news that the COVID-19 vaccine from drugmaker Pfizer (PFE) and its partner  BioNTech  (BNTX) is 90% effective, according to  Bernstein Research  strategist  Inigo Fraser Jenkins , has sent stocks scurrying like ""tracks left in a cloud chamber from particles scattering in an accelerator.""

Goldman Sachs strategists, led by  David Kostin , say the vaccine is a more important development for the economy and markets than the prospective policies of a Biden presidency. ""The divisive  U.S.  presidential campaign was actually a backdrop to the main event: a public health crisis that has tragically claimed 240,000 lives in the  U.S.  since it began. However, within less than a year, a vaccine has been discovered,"" they say.

The Goldman team boosted its year-end price target on the S&P 500 to 3700 from 3600, which isn't so far away from Tuesday's closing level of 3545.53. Goldman is also targeting 4300 by the end of 2021 and 4600 by the end of 2022.

The strategists expect the Pfizer vaccine, and possibly others, will receive emergency use authorization by the end of January, and sufficient doses will be available for the  U.S.  population during the first half of 2021. They increased earnings estimates, mostly reflecting the better-than-expected results for the third quarter. They also are expecting better growth in the  U.S.  next year than the market does, at 5.3% versus the consensus forecast of 3.8%. A weakening  U.S.  dollar and slack in the labor market should support S&P 500 sales and margins, they add.

They are not too worried about the weight of the technology giants -- Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and  Google  owner Alphabet (GOOGL). The S&P 500 would rise 9% if the FAAMG stocks trade sideways and the remaining 495 stocks rise by the historical median 12-month rise of 12%. And the S&P 500 would rise 16% if the FAAMG stocks rise 5% and the remaining 495 climb 20%, which would represent an 80th percentile move based on historical distribution since 1990.

As for the debate about value or growth, the Goldman team likes both. For value stocks, the team noted that Monday was the largest single-day increase in the factor's history since 1980, while they say growth stocks should continue to benefit from weak trend economic growth and low interest rates.

""When thinking about the potential resolution of today's record valuation dispersion, investors often recall the unwind of the tech bubble, which was characterized by a two-year bear market and large negative absolute returns of the previous market leaders. More often than not, however, value rallies tend to occur in rising markets during which high valuation stocks also rise but are outpaced by the lowest valuation firms. This 'catch up' dynamic is what we expect will take place in coming months as a vaccine is approved and distributed,"" the strategists say.",38,0.79

I was wondering what everyone's experience is with this. I don't have FOMO when I buy long-term stocks like AAPL, MSFT, etc. since I'm sure they'll still provide steady gains for years to come. However, I'm more iffy on other stocks that have reached their all time highs, as I worry that it won't produce much more than it has. Take ETSY for example. I planned on buying a share yesterday morning with my $200, since they were at about $183. Then I saw in the pre-market that it shot up to about $206. So I bought a share of Disney instead, since I'm more confident in them in the long-term. My question is, are most people confident in these growth stocks like ETSY to continue shooting up and constantly breaking their ATH? I'm still learning how to do all my proper research on companies and industries, but I don't see them turning into the next GOOG or AMZN or anything. As a result, it makes me feel like I wouldn't see as many gains with this stock. I don't have enough money to buy multiple shares, and I wouldn't want to buy one share of a company and only make about $50 when I could've bought more shares of a cheaper stock for more gains. It's not so much that I have FOMO with growth stocks, it's more like fear of not maximizing potential gains. Thoughts?",0,0.45

2020-12-29 12:23:17,A Brief Guide on Risk and Equity Investing,"Hello all, I am a graduate student in finance with a bachelor's degree in Accounting. I wrote my thesis on how macroeconomic policy affects US equity markets (equity markets = stock market). I've spent the last 3 years studying this stuff and I'd say that I am not qualified in any sense to give sound investment advice. What that should tell you is that the stock market is an extremely complex landscape and takes years to understand. Even the best of the best lose money. With that being said, this comment is for informational purposes and not to be taken as investment advice or direction.

&#x200B;

I originally wrote this post as a comment to another user, but thought that it may be beneficial for others to use. It's very surface level, but I think it does a good job of answering some more abstract questions that people may have about equity markets. I also think it does a good job of establishing a solid, albeit basic idea of value investing and financial analysis.

\---

Understand that the last ten years does not accurately represent equity markets historically. From 1925 to 1941, if you invested in the S&P 500 index, you would have seen an average annual return of less than 5% with several of those years being negative- over the next ten years. Same goes for 1960 to 1975. (Disclaimer: Before people tear me apart saying you can't invest in the S&P 500 directly, I know. I'm using it as an example.)

&#x200B;

We've experienced a remarkably strong bull market over the last ten years, with 20% annual returns on the S&P 500 index; however, just because we've had a strong market the last ten years does not mean it will stay that way. Consider Japan in the early 1990s. Their bull market turned into a bubble (google: financial bubble) and for the next 10 years they saw no long term growth in their equity markets. They call the 1990s in Japan, ""the lost decade"". So this begs the question: if there are 10, sometimes 15 year long periods where we have almost no growth, or perhaps negative returns, when, where, and why should I park my money in equities?

&#x200B;

The first thing I think we should understand is **risk**. Risk is at the heart of almost all things ""investing"". If you go to the casino, and place $5,000 straight at the roulette table, your payout is a massive 35:1. If your bet hits, you walk away with $180,000. But statistically, your chances of winning are less than 3%. The risk is massive. Alternatively, if you buy a 3-month US treasury bill, the payout is around .1%. Meaning you would made $5 on a $5,000 investment. Why? The risk is so low. Also, what is a 3-month US treasury bill? Let me explain.

&#x200B;

A US Treasury bill is a short-term government debt security. Here's how it works. You give the US government $5,000. They now owe you $5,000 PLUS interest at a future date. In this example, it's 3 months. The US government says, ""Thank you! We will give you $5,005 back in three months!"" In three months, they give you the money back. Ask yourself, if you had to guess the percentage likelihood of the US government collapsing in the next three months, what would it be? Pretty low, right? That's why the return is so low. The United States government has the power, means, right, and infrastructure to tax the wealthiest population on the planet. Also, they aren't going out of business anytime soon. Therefore, that $5 return on a $5,000 investment is essentially guaranteed. [Check out this chart.](https://www.ngpf.org/blog/investing/chart-explaining-investing-concept-risk-return/)

&#x200B;

All stocks sit somewhere on this line of risk and return. But, how do we know the risk and return? Great question. How do we assess the value of an asset? An asset's worth is the sum of its future cash flows discounted to today's dollars. Read that again. An asset's worth is the sum of its future cash flows discounted to today's dollars. This is what we call ""Net Present Value"". [Here's a video over it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-lN5xORIwc) [Here's the NPV formula.](https://www.educba.com/net-present-value-formula/)

&#x200B;

Let's say we have a machine that spits out one dollar every year for 5 years. What is the value of that machine assuming a 2% inflation rate every year? Let's find out! Remember our NPV formula? Let's do the math. \[$1 / (1+ .02)1\] + \[$1 / (1+ .02)2\]+ ... + \[$1 / (1+ .02)5\] = $4.71. In this example, inflation rate is the discount rate; however, the discount rate can be many other things. We won't go into that right now though.

&#x200B;

So what does this mean to you? It gives you perspective. All those price movements in the stock market are the product of huge investment banks, mutual funds, and hedge funds moving money in and out of equities in massive quantities, with those decisions backed by hundreds, if not thousands of hours of research with private data that you can't access even if you had the money too.

&#x200B;

One of the big ways they (big banks) make these decisions is by using the NPV formula with Net Income in the numerator to determine the value of the asset and a rate to discount the cash flows at (there are ways to do this, again, we won't go into it). Then they use more complex methods to assess risk. Other methods of valuation may be used, but again, this is one of the big ones.

&#x200B;

So far, we've learned that risk and reward are positively correlated and companies are valued by their earnings. But, if companies are valued by their earnings, then why do bubbles happen? Why does the market tank sometimes? Shouldn't the market accurately reflect all companies at any given time? In theory, yes. But humans are irrational creatures, and often wrong. Therefore, stock prices are not always appropriately valued.

&#x200B;

I am going to introduce you to two financial ratios: earnings per share (EPS) and price to earnings (P/E) ratio. NOTE: EARNINGS = NET INCOME.

&#x200B;

Earnings per share is the net income of a company divided by it's number of outstanding shares. EPS = Net Income / Shares Outstanding. So let's say my company has a net income of $100 for the 2020 year and there are 100 shares outstanding. That would mean that my company's EPS is $1. Let's look at a real example: Apple. [Click on this link.](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019320000096/aapl-20200926.htm) In the top left hand corner, click on sections>financial statements>consolidated statements of operations. Find EPS. Apple's EPS is 3.31. That's pretty solid. EPS puts a companies earnings in perspective with respect to the number of shareholders it has, which allows you to compare a companies earnings to its competitors, whether they be smaller or larger.

&#x200B;

Next, the price to earnings ratio. This is easy to calculate. It is just the share price divided by the EPS. PE = Price / EPS. What this does is puts the price of the stock in perspective with respect to its earnings. Consider the example where my company had an EPS of $1. Let's say the price of my stock is $30 per share. That would mean my PE ratio is 30 (PE raio of 30 = $30/$1 EPS). For some perspective on the PE ratio- the average P/E ratio in the S&P 500 is 25-30. But they can be as high as 1,000 (like Tesla) or as low 4 or 5. What the PE ratio does is says, ""Hey man, here's a metric to determine how justifiable the price of this stock is considering how much the company makes."" Generally speaking, investing in companies that have low PE ratios tend to show higher returns. Why? Because there is more of an acceptable margin (historically) for the price to increase with respect to earnings.

&#x200B;

For example: Five years ago, Apple's PE ratio was around 10. Now it's 40. This means the price went up, the earnings went down, or both. Over the last 5 years, Apple's EPS has increased. Therefore, because it's PE ratio is increasing as well, this means that it's price of the stock is increasing faster than it's earnings. [Reference this chart.](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio) This isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just means that the big boys like Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, etc. think that Apple is going to do really well over the coming years as of right now. But let's say that tomorrow Apple was outed as a front for a money laundering scheme and they were going to be audited by the SEC and FBI. The price would tank. Why? Because people would be questioning if Apple would even exist as a company in the following years. **They (the big boys, the government, me and you) would doubt their earnings.** Rightfully so, I should add.

&#x200B;

What I (and many others) do is look at companies and determine:

&#x200B;

1. Are their earnings sound? (Is it positive? If not, will it be positive? Will the company grow? Will another company come in and do whatever this company is doing, better?) This will help you determine if the return will be solid.
2. What is the current price of the equity in relation to the earnings? (What's the PE? Is it going up? Is it going down? Why?) This will help you determine how risky is your investment.

&#x200B;

A solid company is generally one that has a high EPS, a low PE ratio, and is expected to grow. The reason Tesla has a PE ratio of >1,000 is because people expect it to grow. Like, they expect it to be the largest electric vehicle company by net income in the next 10-20 years AND expand into other markets like solar energy and batteries. Will they be right? I guess we'll see!

&#x200B;

This is the tip of the ice berg when it comes to investing. If you truly want to learn how to capture returns without exposing your investment to a large amount of risk, you are going to have to spend time learning how to do this. Here are some resources:

&#x200B;

* The Intelligent Investor (with Commentary) by Benjamin Graham. Read it entirely, the commentary first, then the chapters (Commentary, chapter, commentary, chapter, ...). Then read the commentary again and make notes.
* Learn how to read three financial statements: The balance sheet, the income statement, the statement of cash flows.
* Watch Martin Shkreli's investing lessons on Youtube. Specifically the first 5 or 6. Yes, he's done some bad stuff. But he really is an excellent teacher and extremely smart.

&#x200B;

In my opinion, experience is a great teacher. Play with a small amount of money. Throw $100 at a stock you like and see what happens to it. If it drops 10% in a day, figure out why. If it goes up 10% in a day, figure out why. If it goes up steadily over the next six months, figure out why. If it doesn't do anything- figure out why.

&#x200B;

I'd like to note again that these opinions do not constitute investment advice. They are my personal opinions and do not guarantee any sort of returns. This is how I personally approach the stock market. Investing in any asset carries risk and all investors should conduct their own due diligence and analysis before investing.

2020-08-02 16:59:56,"Over 21 months later, here's how /r/investing performed on the underrated stock survey. Inspired by Mr_Suzan and galloog1.","In October of 2018, /u/Mr_Suzan was inspired by a post from /u/galloog1 to seek out underrated stock picks from the /r/investing community and monitor their performance.  


Post-COVID bounce, I wanted to see how these picks have performed, so I've gathered them all here.

A few of these have earnings posting soon, so the ranks may change, but overall it looks like a solid performance by the community.  Any new underrated stocks to think about?  

&nbsp;

# Some quick stats:

- Overall average return: ~33% (compared to ~18% for the S&P 500)

- Equal rated return: ~50% (as pointed out by /u/csp256)

- Return on the most upvoted pick: Disney (DIS) 1%

- Highest returning pick: Enphase (ENPH) 1110% (recommended by /u/williemax)

- If you invested in the top 5 most upvoted stocks, you would have seen a 27% return

- If you invested in the top 5 most controversial stocks, you would have seen a 99% return

- The top 10 gainers in order were ENPH, TSLA, APT, DXCM, OKTA, AYX, BAND, ALU, WIX, LRCX

- If you had picked one of these stocks at random, you would have had a ~53% chance of >10% gains and a ~19% chance of >100% gains

If you'd like to participate in the next round, I've opened up a new survey here:

2019-03-10 05:10:32,"Good companies at good prices (3PEA, AAPL, CFR)","Hi,

If I may I’d like to take a couple of minutes do your time to tell you about a blog I began recently. The goal is to post write-ups about companies I find interesting, whether I’m invested in them or not, and to also post about certain topics I find pertinent when researching about companies. On top of that, it would be great to have people give me feedback on the blog so we can discuss whatever is of interest more in-depth.

I’m open to other people posting on the blog, subject to review.

I have a few posts on the blog already.

The blog is on Wordpress and it’s called Neto’s notes,

I can’t link it here because this subreddit doesn’t allow promotional posts, I don’t think it makes sense to copy and paste what I’ve written on my website here. So if you’re interested hope over to the website and we can chat about it here or there (in the comment section). 

I hope this is valuable information for anyone out there.

2020-07-30 13:34:17,"Apple crushes Q3 expectations, announces 4-1 stock split","Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL?p=AAPL&.tsrc=fin-srch)) reported its Q3 2020 earnings on Thursday, providing investors and analysts with a more fuller look at how deeply the coronavirus pandemic has impacted the company’s sales over the past several months.

These are the most important numbers from the report compared to analysts’ expectations as compiled by Bloomberg.

* **Revenue:** $59.69 billion versus $52.3 billion expected
* **Earnings per share:** $2.58 versus $2.07 expected
* **iPhone revenue:** $26.42 billion versus $30.9 billion expected.
* **Services revenue:** $13.2 billion versus $13.1 billion expected
* **Accessories:** $6.5 billion versus $6.1 billion expected

Apple’s earnings come just a day after CEO Tim Cook sat before the House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law to answer accusations that the company abuses its market power to [stifle competition in the Apple App Store](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-ceo-tim-cook-hit-with-questions-on-app-store-dominance-during-antitrust-hearing-224150894.html).

The company’s Q3 report, however, hasn’t been much of a focus for analysts, as much of the conversation about Apple has revolved around the tech giant’s upcoming launch of its iPhone 12. The next-generation iPhone is expected to be Apple’s first 5G-capable device and could lead to a so-called “super cycle,” during which the company would see a larger than normal uptick in iPhone sales.

The idea is that consumers who have held on to their devices for several years will jump at the chance to get a new iPhone with a new form of cellular connectivity that promises dramatically increased data.

But with consumer personal consumption spending in Q2 [falling a whopping 34.6%](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/q2-gdp-us-economy-coronavirus-pandemic-consumer-171558880.html) due to COVID-19 shutdowns, and more than [50 million Americans out of the workforce](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobless-claims-week-ending-july-25-123150219.html), investor hopes of a massive uptick in year-over-year iPhone sales in the coming quarters may not be in the cards.

2017-08-10 05:55:36,Factors which could drive AAPL stock higher,"1.Despite all the talk of commoditization iPhone continues to deliver strong results. In the third quarter, Apple sold 41 million units of iPhone, slightly higher than Wall Street's estimate.
2.The dividends continue to attract income investors, share buy back helps the company in delivering higher EPS.
3.Services revenues have grown at a CAGR of around 23% per year over the last five years. And this segment will continue to grow at a rapid pace for years to come.",11,0.74
2017-02-22 22:03:13,Why I'm not buying AAPL at these prices (but the price I would be interested in it),"Below is my analysis of Apple (AAPL). As of 2/22/17 it is trading at $137.11 and has EPS of $8.31.


*Business outlook*: I believe that their business model faces significant headwinds. They distinguish themselves as a company by being able to sell the same product at a significant premium to their peers (this includes their smartphones, tablets, and computers). According to their financial reports, iPhones account for over 60% of their earnings. I believe that the smartphone industry as a whole is saturating, meaning there are less people out there needing to buy a smartphone, and further, that Apple is losing market share to their Android peers as other smartphone companies are consistently cranking out very, very solid products (Samsung, Google to name a few). I believe that within 5 years we will see severe margin compression as Apple struggles to attract new iPhone users and keep existing iPhone users. I believe in the future smartphones will all be very similar in performance and thus will be subject to a price war.


*Valuation*: Currently AAPL trades at a p/e of about 16.5. I believe that their earnings *may* be higher YOY 2017, but in the subsequent years will continue the downward trend seen in 2015-2016. Thus I personally do not consider them to be a growth play and any purchase in the security would be as a value play. For a company with a pessimistic earnings future, I view a p/e of 16.5 to be too high and provides a poor margin of safety.


*The good (or is it really that good?)*

1. Their Cash hoard: Yes, they have a lot of cash - about $240B according to their latest filings. However before we get too giddy about this, there are several obstacles in the way: there is no guarantee that Trump will be able to allow repatriation of foreign overseas cash (90% of AAPL’s cash is overseas), and even if he did, we have no way of knowing if it’ll be this year, the next year, or in 4 years, and even if it was this year, just how much is that cash worth? There are several ways to value cash on hand, the most generous being to directly discount it from market cap. Subtracting $240B from AAPL’s market cap would put them at an adjusted p/e of 11. This is cheap, but not that cheap - especially if my bearish outlook on the smartphone industry comes to fruition. The reason this is considered an optimistic valuation of the cash is because they are more likely to use the cash to overpay for an acquisition than simply buy back stock.


2. Their 10th anniversary iPhone: I’m sure it’ll be amazing, actually I hope it will be (I’m an apple user). However, these earnings will be short term as then they’ll face the same challenges they faced 2015-2016: everyone would already have a great iPhone and would no need to upgrade. We can be wishful and hope that Wall Street only cares about 2017 and early 2018 earnings, but we should know better than that - Wall Street cares about future earnings more than anything else.


3. They might have something else down the pipeline: This is true, but there isn’t evidence of this yet and thus I would rather not pay a premium for this - I’d rather get this for free as part of the margin of safety.


*Is it a short?* Not quite, it is not majorly overvalued as of this point. Even if we assume that earnings drop 50%, they are still selling at a p/e near 30, which isn’t overly pricy.


*At what price do I like it?*: I like AAPL <$100. Because I do not believe in their long term earnings prospects, I require a larger than normal margin of safety. At $100, That would put them at a p/e of about 12, or an adjusted p/e of 6.5 (accounting for cash, using the optimistic estimation seen above) I think that at this price, it would make for a very good value play that can generate 30-40% median upside.

The stock looks very undervalued with it's ~12 P/E and PEG about 1.0. The dividend is decent enough and will continue to grow. Sure 68% of their profit is from iPhone and they need to diversify, but their products spit out cash like crazy. Management seems focus on quality products and creating shareholder value.

2020-10-21 14:53:24,MSFT as a part of your stocks,"MSFT is big part of the Technology industry. Microsoft's market cap is $1,686.5 billion. It makes up 5.95% of VOO the vanguard SandP 500 ETf and 10.78% of QQQ the Nasdaq 100 ETF. It has many products that make up a big part of the world such as Github, Azure,Dynamics 365,LinkedIn ,Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Xbox and all of their stores that sell computers and laptops. Their Moat is being heavily diversified among many industries that will continue to grow and succeed in the future. Revenue in Q4 2020 was $38.0 billion and increased 13% from Q3 2020. Of that Revenue in Productivity and Business Processes was $11.8 billion and increased 6%. Some highlights in this industry was Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 5% driven by Office 365 Commercial revenue growth of 19%,   Office Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 6% and Office 365 Consumer subscribers increased to 42.7 million,  LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and  Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 13% driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 38% .   Revenue in Intelligent Cloud was $13.4 billion and increased 17%, with the really cool part of Azure revenue growth of 47%. This shows that the cloud or Azure is growing massively as the Industry is still very new and growing rapidly very year. Revenue in More Personal Computing was $12.9 billion and increased 14% with an interesting point of  Xbox content and services revenue increased 65% . The 4th gen Xbox will be released in the later half of 2020 which should include many amounts of Revenue for Microsoft. Microsoft had a total revenue of  $143.0 billion and increased 14% YOY.

Now we shall look at some of the Financials of MSFT. MSFT has $136.527B cash on hand as of Q4 2020. That could buy Starbucks and still have 40 billion USD left over. They have a P/E ratio of 38.76 which can be considered rich but compared with other Tech companies such as AMZN with a P/E ratio of 128.17 and APPl with a P/E ratio of 36.83. This is in line with the coamnpies with a similar market cap.  The Debt to Equity is  0.50. which is very good for a company with MSFT stature. MSFT dividend is $2.04 with a dividend with a yield of 0.92% which is alright for a growth company. The Profit margin is 30.96% which is ridiculous for such a highly valued company. MSFT P/S ratio is 11.55 which alright considering their market cap. The P/B ratio is 13.70 which is high but considering other tech companies such as AAPL with a P/B of 27.5 and AMZN with P/B ratio of 21.86. They have debt but their total assets outweigh their liabilities. MSFT share holder  equity is $118.304B which is very good for them. 

Future Growth and my price target for Microsoft 

 Cloud computing service is a market which is somewhat new but is rapidly expanding. Microsoft Azure is about a third of MSFT revenue but it will grow faster and faster as the  cloud computing service market grows. It is currently worth about $371.4 Billion in 2020 and it is projected in 2025 to be  $832.1 Billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 17.5%.  Also MSFT will continue to supe up the next generation Xbox with new gaming studios and Xbox exclusives. MSFt is also trying to get into the 5G business and it has also created a strategic partnership with Starlink which will give many people faster internet which will MSFT in the long term. MSFT is very stable and increasing on markets that grow very quickly and that will add to its MOAT and it will continue to grow. My price target in 2025  is 445 USD which is about a 100 percent return.",37,0.74

2020-08-23 13:04:54,Differences and similarities between 2000 and now.,"
I've posted bits and pieces of this in some comments since some form of the question has come up on this subreddit. I want to list out a list of reasons why today is like the dot com times and ALSO what is different about today. I am not a financial professional, but I have been working in the tech industry for over 20 years. It is mostly tech stock focused.

I'm going to also add (fact) or (anecdotal) or (opinion) to my bullet points, so take those bullet points with the appropriate grain of salt.

Reasons we are NOT like the dot-com boom (roughly in order of importance):

* (fact) Interest rates are much lower now and long term expectations on yield is also low. In 1999, the 10 year treasury was at around 5% and rose to over 6.5% in 2000. The P/E of the S&P 500 in 2000 was around 30. Which means that the 10 year treasury yielded MORE than the S&P 500 earnings. This is absolutely not true today with the 10 year treasury yield being around 0.6% and P/Es being around 25-30. This single point is extremely important to understand.
* (fact) Late stage VCs are more of a thing now than they were in dot com. Thus you have fewer IPOs and the companies that do are more mature and less speculative (of course there are outliers, see below).
* (fact) The NASDAQ P/E in 2000 was really quite ridiculous (I can't find a chart for some reason, i think it was around 80). S&P 500 was more comparable between 2000 and now.
* (anecdotes) You can no longer get a job at a startup / real tech firm just because you know HTML or can write ""hello world"" in Perl. A lot of firms back in the late 90's were trying to fatten up the employee count and race to IPO to cash out. This doesn't happen today.
* (fact) There was no pandemic in 2000 and it makes comparisons hard.

Reasons we are like the dot-com boom (roughly in order of importance)

* (anecdotes) Sentiment on the ground is very similar to what you hear during the dot com boom. We make fun of the people who invest in stupid shit like NKLA, HTZ, etc. But a lot of people are creaming their pants still on the big tech (FAMANG) saying they are forever-holds / they can't go down, etc. You also now are starting to see intelligent, rational people putting money in things **precisely** because other people will and assume they can get out before it all falls apart.
* (fact) In the late 90s, internet brokers were a new thing and made trading easier for people who didn't know anything -- and we see that today with COVID stay-at-homers and an influx of users into robinhood (I wish I could get hard numbers on the comparison). (opinion) Because of this, I'm fairly certain pricing is out of whack for a large number of companies.
* (fact) The P/E ratios of the big techs today are higher than a lot of the big techs during 2000. Nasdaq P/E in 2000 was off the chart, but if you just look at the big profitable companies like INTC, ORCL, AAPL, HPQ, IBM, which were the equivalent of FAMANG today, they had P/Es mostly under 30s. FAMANG are around 35 except for Netflix and Amazon which are much higher (see huge caveat on interest rates above). CSCO and MSFT in 2000 were the outliers having P/Es of well over 60.
* (anecdotes) In tech companies, a common business plan for new firms in the last ~8 years is to get market share at any cost and figure out profitability later. This is really no different from dot com when firms were valued by number of ""eyeballs"".
* (opinion) ""this time is different"". At least in terms of technology, it's not. The internet itself was a bigger ""paradigm shift"" than what we are seeing today. I used ""paradigm shift"", because was a common buzzword that turned into a joke back in the late 90s and used to justify crazy valuations. Machine Learning is amazing, but not on par with connecting everyone on the globe. And the cloud is just a fancy name for running something on someone else's computer (even though its quite nice how easy and seamless it is today vs. 20 years ago).
* (anecdotes) While it is harder to IPO today without profitability or clear path to profitability, it clearly still happens (UBER, LYFT, SNAP). And others are using backdoor IPOs (NKLA, SPCE).
* (fact) In 2000, the IT sector along with Media stocks and the Telecommunications Services sector approached 40% of the S&P market cap. The categories have changed but if you combine IT and Communication Services sectors, you get a 38% of S&P market cap today. If you add Amazon which is not included in IT/Communication, you get over 40%. Does this mean anything, especially since we are in a pandemic and more stuff runs on IT? Not sure.

You can definitely pick apart some of the individual points, I just wanted to lay them all out and see what people thought and if anyone has other valid comparisons. I personally think we ARE in some kind of tech bubble, but I'm not going to make a fool of myself in predictions on when and how it will burst. And fuck it, while I do have more in cash than typical, I'm still in VTI/VXUS and a bunch of individual tech names since I have the background to do some analysis on the business.

I'll end with a few random thoughts:

* In August 1999, a lot of people were looking at the craziness of the dot com boom and how people were throwing money at stupid shit. I don't care what people say, it was pretty obvious something was wrong. If you shorted the NASDAQ then, you will watch the NASDAQ more than double in 7 months time and have your face ripped off.
* Taking what I've posted as a whole, the one thing to be terrified about is if long term interest rates rise and the fed is either powerless or does not step in for whatever reason. This will completely destroy the stock and bond market. I don't see the catalyst for it, but I'm no economic genius. You might be able to make an argument that gold is a hedge for this unlikely scenario. There is also the worry of a slump in earnings due to general economic malaise, but that is a garden variety concern that everyone is watching for and usually pretty temporary. Rise in interest rates would be real bad.",194,0.92
2017-03-03 06:12:26,Should I buy back my AAPL?,"I bought apple stock back in college in like 2008 or 2009. After the split I had about 36 shares. It did well and I made a few thousand off of my initial ~$700 investment. 

Because I'm an idiot who did no research before selling, I sold right before their last quarterly report. I had read some articles that the iPhone 7 was doing poorly and I also didn't like the no headphone jack idea (now I kinda do like it). I sold it at $115.

Since then I've watched their stock rise to nearly $139. Because of my poor decision I lost out on a potential extra $864. Not a life changer but it just hurt my pride. I've been fighting the temptation to buy back in lately, but every time I get back online the price has risen. What do you think? Just keep my earnings and take this as a lesson, or maybe consider buying back in?

Apple does have a lot going for them in the near future, but it will cost me $864 to buy back in and I'd have to hope the price continues to skyrocket at least as much as it has since I sold. I'm leaning on not doing it but I'm interested in your opinions.",21,0.75

Made mistake of posting similar thread to wsb. Some enthusiasm for $NVTA, “$SPY” (maybe meant $CRWD), and $BIGC. 

Skeptical of $BIGC as $SPOT much more heavily entrenched AND growing faster. 

$NVTA is interesting and don’t write it off. But some problems I see (1) ask any clinician and you’ll learn genomic medicine hasn’t lived up to hype, yes we know SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms), linkage etc but everything “polyfactoral,” even “epigenetic” and known risk factors (diet, exercise, family history, SES, etc) tend to be much more helpful; (2) insofar as genomics can be monetized would see a as to yet unknown startup with flashier marketing and better tech interface taking spoils; (3) don’t really see enough brand loyalty (compared with cult like followings of $AAPL $TSLA even $LULU) to any genomics company but particularly not to $NVTA which has marketed itself mostly to clinicians—will be important in a crowded space with several viable competitors. 

So only one real candidate worth discussing so far. Any other ideas?

**AMZN** jumped so much because it's actually expanding its business through their own delivery system (like you might've seen some prime-labelled vehicles parked on your street), and people increased their online buying habits while not going out, so its price grew a lot during this few months, which I believe is justified.

Your pick must be an actual traded stock of an active company with $1B+ market cap and be listed on NYSE or NASDAQ exchanges. Post your pick publicly in the comments and do it before the market opens on Friday. Good luck!

**Edit 1:** Kudos to you brave souls who have already made your picks. For those that are complaining, just pick a ticker. It's a game, lighten up and have some fun!

**Edit 2:** Still waiting on ""stockbroker"" (ironic, no?) to make his call. Lots of pixels spilled in this thread but no ticker symbol yet. All work and no play makes stockbroker a dull boy;-)

**Edit 3:** Edits on your pick posts will DQ them. Thanks for playing along - this will be interesting. There are some great picks in here. I'd like to say I'm going to put them on a spreadsheet (like the monthly Stock Picks contest) but I seriously doubt I'll get to it. Any enterprising volunteers?",57,0.71
2020-10-21 14:41:14,Thoughts on the market in the months ahead,"I'm generally a buy and hold person. I have money in general market ETFs as well as 5-10 individual companies at any one time. I held through the volatility last year and earlier this year as I figured short term corrections were due and everything would recover. I have started selling off some of my positions in recent days though as the market seems to be at odds with reality. COVID is not improving (at least here in the US), and the election will likely create volatility (I think a correction either way it goes). Everything I have bought or held over the last year is up 30% or more and i just can't see this as sustainable without some pull back.

&#x200B;

I'm usually 100% equities (95% US/5% International) but have started selling off at what i think are opportune moments and am now at 85% equities with 15% cash. The positions I sold were AAPL and INTC (both of which have gained more I believe they should have in recent months).

I'm not claiming to know anything, but rather am interested in others predictions for the next 12+ months.",16,0.75
2020-11-01 11:08:20,Investing Strategies - Dividend Growth Investing - Advantages/Disadvantages + Breakdown,"# Introduction

Hello guys, this will be a breakdown for the Dividend Growth strategy. It is important to understand how companies need to be evaluated differently based on the investment philosophy you are pursuing. Now, investing in a dividend growth strategy takes time and patience, depending on your income goal, it can take awhile before a dividend portfolio can fully support enough cash flow to sustain your lifestyle without you needing to rely on a full-time or part-time job. But that is the exciting part, once you have enough income from the dividends you can retire or work a job that you perhaps find more exciting?

# The Strategy:

The dividend growth strategy is focused on building up a portfolio of high quality companies that not only pay out a dividend, but have regularly been increasing the dividend payout. The end goal is to create passive income to live off the increasing dividend payouts. So the focus is placed more on the cash flow for wealth rather than the stock appreciation (appreciation is ofcourse an added bonus).

NOTE: **Dividend yield is not main focus.** A common misconception is that a high dividend yield, is the most important measure, however, a yield that is considerably higher similar stocks in the same industry may indicate not a good dividend but rather a depressed price due to company issues. This price may signal a dividend cut or the elimination of the dividend. Most dividend ETFs will filter out the top percentage of dividends yields for this reason.

The strategy here is on the **dividend growth**. If a company increases their payout overtime it is going to have an insane snowball effect when the dividends are reinvested (kinda like the snowball effect for paying off debt). Dividend growth investing uses the compounding effect of reinvesting dividends into the same investment to increase your future dividend payments. With each reinvestment, your shares grow slightly larger. With slightly more shares, your next dividend payment is sightly larger. With enough time invested in solid companies, the growth effect is amazing. This is why dividend growers are so important, they add more fuel to this compounding effect!

If you really want to see this effect visualized, check out the charts for Warren Buffets wealth. In 2018 alone, Berkshire raked in **$3.8 billion** in dividends – “a sum that will increase in 2019,” Buffett said in the annual letter. The great majority of the stocks in Berkshire's portfolio are dividend stocks. And many of those stock are growing their dividend.

# Disadvantages:

* Dividends are not always guaranteed. In 2020, there we dozens of companies that cut their dividends due to financial pressure. At any moment, companies can hugely decrease their dividend payout or completely get rid of it. **However, there have been many quality companies that have still increased their payouts during this time.**
* Unless you are holding these stocks in an IRA you will pay taxes on them. Growth stocks typically don’t pay out so there’s no forced withdrawal, so you don’t get hit with taxes, however the trade off is you are now reliant on the appreciation of the stock.
* When compared to index investing it decreases diversification since you're really only invested into “large cap” stocks. You'll be missing out on the mid-cap and small-cap stocks
* Some say dividend payouts of the sign of a dying company. For some perhaps this is true, however a strong counter argument is this. If a company is well established and the payout for moving into a new market sector, or a new acquisition wouldn't be favorable, a company can instead payout dividends to entice investors rather than potentially sacrifice company value just in the name of potential growth.

# Advantages:

* Historically dividends have provided 43% of the S&P 500 total return from 1930 - 2017 (according to Blackrock). Dividends provide an ongoing return while waiting for capital appreciation.
* The snowball effect of dividend growth compounding can provide competitive returns regardless of whether the price of the stock increases in value or not.
* **Reinvesting dividends during sideways moving markets, bear markets, and corrections, purchase more shares with the dividend while the prices are lower. Later, when prices recover, the return is actually enhanced by the temporary fall in the stock price. Reinvesting dividends and accumulating more shares during corrections and bear markets greatly boosts dividend growth investing returns in the long run. This is a significant advantage of dividend stocks over growth stocks in less than ideal market conditions.**
* Creating passive income and preserving capital. Like all stocks they are an excellent hedge against inflation.

# Types of Companies to invest into:

Below will be a list of Dividend paying companies that have **increased their dividends yearly**. Often when you are researching these companies you will see them thrown into these categories based on how often they have increased their dividends:

* Challenger: 5+ years
* Contender: 10-24 years
* Champion/Aristocrat: 25+ years
* King: 50+ years

And now the companies (only a few common examples, there are way too many to list):

* AAPL - Apple - Challenger
* MSFT - Microsoft - Contender
* JPM - JPMorgan Chase - Challenger
* VZ - Verizon - Contender
* JNJ - Johnson and Johnson - King
* MMM - 3M - King
* T - AT&T - Champion
* KO - Coca-Cola - King

And so on, many of these companies are ones we all recognize because they are so well established have have very wide markets. They have incredible staying power for these reasons, often having enough money to expand into new markets by buying up new companies or just allocating free capital to the sectors.

# How to evaluate the companies for this strategy:

Since the focus of this investing is less on capital appreciation and more on the dividend growth we need to evaluate the following factors:

* Dividend payout ratio:
   * Payout less than 50% of its earnings in the form of dividends is generally considered stable
   * The company has the potential to raise its earnings over the long term.
* Free Cash Flow to Equity:
   * This is simply what is paid out after expenses and debts have been paid. If a company has too much debt it can affect their ability to continue paying out and increasing their dividends.
* Debt to EBITDA ratio (Earnings before interest depreciation and amortization)
   * A company with a lower ratio, when compared to similar companies, is more attractive. See AT&T vs Verizon!
* **High dividend yield are not the focus and can often signal an unsustainable payout! Look for companies in the healthier 3-6% range. (Do research after this ofcourse, this doesn't immediately mean it is healthy)**

There are ofcourse many other factors. Consider the business, does it have a sustainable model (Coca-Cola $ Pepsi)? Is its market shrinking (See oil companies)? Do you like the company and management?? For this type of investing (any type really), you need to know what you are investing into!

# Performance & Final Thoughts:

It depends on what timeframe you are looking at, if say we take from December 1999 - 2017 the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index outperformed the S&P 500 by 3.37% per year. But if we take other timeframes then the S&P500 is dominant. Beating the S&P500 over the long term is near impossible, but **beating the S&P isn't the goal of this strategy**. This strategy is focused on passive income.

Please supplement this post with your own research. Compare this strategy to general index investing and growth investing. Find what is right for you.

The hope is this post provided insight into this strategy and evaluating dividend paying companies. Each different type of investor can learn from the other, dividend vs index vs growth or otherwise. Anyways, have a good day everyone!

2014-09-05 04:02:00,A serious analysis of AAPL,"I'm intrigued by the new opportunities that are expected in the next generation of Apple products and services. I think Apple is in the position to truly capitalize on their ecosystem and open a significant number of revenue streams. I'm going to detail them one by one, feel free to poke any holes that you may find.

iPhones: From the rumors in the NYT, Apple has ordered up to 40% more phones over last years holiday quarter (1). This would be in the realm of 70-80 million phones. For the previous q1, we were looking at 56% of their (2) $57B in revenues was from the iPhone, ~$32B. Adding 40% to that figure would give you ~$45B. There is a mixture of phones contributing to this though, and the older model phones will *probably* not see the 40% gain. For this analysis, we're going to say that is a negligible portion of the phones/revenues though. 

The kicker for this calculation though, is that there is a rumored higher end iPhone that will be available. The 5.5"" has been rumored to cost an additional $100 and possibly come with a bigger battery, higher resolution screen, and better camera. In my eyes, there are plenty of people willing to give Apple more money, and moving upmarket seems like a fantastic idea. My best estimate is this could be purchased by 20% of buyers, increasing the average selling price a further $20, from $636 (q1 14) to $656 (~3% increase). This leads to a projected revenue for iPhones of $46.5B.

iPads: I think the holiday season is where the iPad shines, they make great gifts and they're probably too expensive to be an impulse purchase the rest of the year. However, the replacement cycle isn't that quick and there doesn't seem to be any killer features on the horizon. My best guess at this market would be flat y/y at 26 million units, or approximately $12B.

Mac: I think the Mac line is poised for growth. They have been aggressively lowering their prices along which will make them much more appealing to people looking to get deeper into the Apple ecosystem. The continuity features look stunning to me and I think it will be one of the first catalysts in a long time to get people to upgrade their computer. Their Mac sales have been on an uptrend and I think the lower prices will help nudge consumers toward Apple's offerings. I think we'll see over 5.5 million Macs sold vs 4.8 in q1 14. However, with a lower selling price, the total revenue may only increase slightly. This would put us in the realm of $7B.

iCloud Services: One of the things I'm most excited about in the new generation of Apple products is the new and improved iCloud. It seems like it will finally be the service people need, fully integrated into Apple's products, and all at a competitive price. With pricing tiers ranging from $1 to $4 per month and above, this could become another great stream of revenue for Apple. Without any historic data it's quite difficult to gauge what percentage of users would begin this subscription, however I think Apple's freemium model for this service (first 5gb is free) will entice many customers to embrace it. My estimate would be 20% of active iPhones will pay for this service ($1+), and 30% of that group will pay for the higher tier ($4). If anyone has any data or speculation to adjust those numbers, I'd be happy to hear. That would mean (350 million active iPhones * .2) 70 million using the service with 21 million of those on the higher tier. We'll ignore the tiers above that as they probably won't be a significant number. That would be an additional $133 million a month, or $400M a quarter.


HomeKit: This looks like it will be a great licensing play for Apple. The prices of many of these products still needs to come down for mass adoption, but Apple is laying the groundwork to control your home and get their cut of the profits. I think it is too early to have any idea what kind of revenues Apple can expect to see from HomeKit, but it has the potential to significantly strengthen the Apple ecosystem and provide Apple with another stream of revenue.

HealthKit: See Above. 

iWallet (unnamed?): From the seemingly confirmed reports, Apple has managed to negotiate rates that are 15 to 25 (.15 to .25%) basis points below current transaction fees. I would assume that will be the cut Apple is going to take on all transactions processed through their new payment system. It looks like this payment system has the potential to work worldwide and hopefully won't be restricted to just a few countries. The best numbers I can find say that Visa processes over $3T a year, MasterCard does $2T, and AMEX does just shy of $1T (3). It's difficult to gauge how many of these credit card holders have iPhones, and then from there how many would embrace Apple's new service. It appears the average person spends $677 a month on each card (4). If Apple were able to get 75% of its users to embrace this on phones sold this year (we'll guess 200M phones sold this year), that would be ((150M*$677)*.0025) an additional $250M per month or $750M per quarter. This is also skewed by the fact that many people have multiple cards, and Apple customers would generally spend more than the average credit card holder. You could probably safely estimate an extra $1B+ per quarter, and more as the install base grows. On an added note, this should be one of the highest margin services Apple has. This will likely take some time to reach it's full potential as it is rumored to only work with the latest devices.

Beats Headphones + Beats Music: Beats apparently did 1.8B in revenues last year. I don't have much insight as to how they will act under Apple so I think saying flat would be a fair assessment. That would add another 450M per quarter, although more heavily weighted toward the holiday quarter.

iWatch/Wearable: I think it's too early to have any real idea what the financial breakdown of this new product will be. The price point is unknown, although rumored to be in the neighborhood of $400. I think something like $300 is more likely but we'll see. We'll come back to this after Tuesday when we hopefully will see what it can do and when it is expected to release.

AppleTV: If Apple ever manages to work out the proper deals, this could be a significant contributor to their bottom line. Until then though, it unfortunately won't be.

iTunes: iTunes has been growing incredibly, and combined with Apple's other services and software has contributed 8% of their bottom line. If it were continue it's growth it should provide about $5B in the next quarter.

Accessories: Accessories should grow in proportion to the iPad/Mac/iPhone growth and continue to contribute 3% to the bottom line. This would give you an additional $2.2B.

So for Q1 2015 (Holiday Quarter), based on the available data, you could be looking at nearly $75B in revenues. This additionally hinges on the iPhone 6 release date, if it were to be released later than Sept 28, it would artificially inflate Q1 2015 at the expense of Q4 2014 with opening week sales. Gross margins would be tough to estimate as even Apple has had trouble estimating them lately, but to be safe I would say something around 38%. This assumes the iWatch won't be released until next year, if they find a way to get it out before the holidays it could increase that amount by a couple billion. This also leaves Apple with some very appealing growth opportunities in services, licensing, and hardware. In a strong bull case, with the iPhone being released Sept 29 and the iWatch being sold before the holidays, and maybe an iPad Pro offering, Q1 '15 could get up to $80B+. 

A full 2015 projection would be approximately Q1 $75B + Q2 $65B + Q3 $53B + Q4 $57B = $250B. I calculated this based on Apple's general revenue pattern over the course of the year, including a bump in Q2 for when I expect the iWatch to be released. With a gross margin of 38% this would be $95B in gross profit, however with a higher priced phone in the mix, higher margin services, and the potential with licensing, I'd bump that up to 39.5%. Leaving you just shy of $99B in gross profit for 2015. After Op Ex and tax you should be left with around ($99B - $26B (Estimate)) = $73B - 26% Effective Tax Rate ... $57B net profit.

Extrapolating from there, that would be a $9.50 EPS. If Apple were to keep its P/E minus cash ($165B) of roughly 12, it would give you a share price of $140.

Much of this analysis is based on the NYT rumor of Apple increasing orders by 40%. If they ultimately don't increase that order or if for some reason they were unable to move all those phones, this would create a vastly different scenario.

This analysis excludes the iPod as I think its future is questionable going forward. 

I've made quite a few leaps of faith in this, and obviously had pretty limited data to work with. If you have any suggestions or improvements, I'm happy to learn.

Apple Inc. AAPL -2.65% unveiled a new iPhone Tuesday capable of connecting to a much faster 5G cellular network, which investors are betting will spur strong demand.

Chief Executive Tim Cook stood at the company’s Cupertino, Calif., headquarters to begin the webcast, streamed on Apple’s website—a visual reminder of how the tech giant’s latest flagship-product introduction differs from previous ones because of the coronavirus pandemic, which closed businesses and left people sheltering at home around the world for much of this year.

The iPhone 12 offered a new physical appearance from last year’s smartphone, moving from a rounded design to a flatter-edged look reminiscent of the iPhone 4. Apple revealed four versions of the phones ranging in sizes and starting in price from $699 for the iPhone 12 Mini with a 5.4-inch display. The iPhone 12 Pro Max has a 6.7-inch display, an increase from 6.5 inches; the higher-end versions emphasize the camera abilities.

The greatest hype going into the event, however, has been about the device’s 5G capability. Apple’s adoption of the next-generation wireless standard places intense focus on the new technology that has been years in the making. Cellular network carriers have been scrambling to roll out 5G service across the U.S., but coverage remains spotty in the country and it isn’t clear yet whether customers will want it.

“Today is the beginning of a new era for iPhone,” Mr. Cook said.

Shares slipped as the event took place, which has occurred with previous Apple events, before rebounding. With few people familiar with the new cellular service, Mr. Cook made an effort to describe why 5G technology would improve their experience. He cited improved downloads and uploads, higher-quality video streaming, better gaming and less network congestion. Apple also highlighted the integration with the company’s new A14 Bionic microchip.

The presentation included demonstrations of how 5G iPhones could be helpful in downloading important medical images and for remotely designing factory spaces—tacit acknowledgments that some of the most likely customers for the technology might be business users who can benefit from faster connections.

Apple reached a staggering $2 trillion market valuation in August, despite years of doubt from critics over whether the tech giant could continue to succeed after the death of Steve Jobs. Here’s a look at Apple’s rise to the very top. Illustration: Jacob Reynolds/WSJ
“Apple almost provides like the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval,” Mark Vena, a senior analyst for Moor Insights & Strategy said. “They tend to validate the technology, which is unfair because you could go out today and buy a Samsung phone” with 5G.

The emphasis on the guts of the iPhone marked a change from recent years where many new features involved cameras and other iterative updates. The lack of dramatic change has come as the smartphone market has matured more than a decade after Apple first introduced the iPhone.

The latest smartphone arrives five years after iPhone unit sales peaked. Mr. Cook has pushed the company to sell pricier versions of the device and to rely on software services and wearables, such as smartwatches and headphones, to boost revenue.

In a nod to those efforts, the company began its Tuesday event by introducing an updated HomePod that is smaller than its previous version of the speaker and is priced at $99.


Apple unveiled a new, smaller HomePod than its previous version of the speaker.

Apple began selling the HomePod in early 2018 after unspecified delays pushed back the rollout following its 2017 debut. The voice-activated device was Apple’s attempt to catch up with the success of Amazon.com Inc. and its smart speakers in late 2014, though when the HomePod debuted at $349 it was considerably more expensive than its rivals.

To make the case for a pricier offering, Apple has previously emphasized its sound quality, especially when it comes to music. The device’s price has fallen since it first went on the market.

The iPhone 12 has been hotly anticipated by investors who have driven up the company’s shares 69% in 2020, partly because of excitement over the new phone. Those expectations and Apple’s success in driving up services revenue helped it become the first U.S. public company to eclipse $2 trillion in market value earlier this year.

Analysts surveyed by FactSet, on average, predict iPhone revenue will rise 15% to $160 billion in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. That is about $6 billion shy of the record set in fiscal 2018, when the $1,000 iPhone X helped bolster sales even as shipments failed to reach a new high.

Katy Huberty, a veteran Apple analyst for Morgan Stanley, last week predicted the company could ship as many as 240 million iPhones this year, helped by customers who haven’t upgraded in several years and excitement for 5G. That would set a record, beating the 231 million devices sold in fiscal 2015. Sales at that level could send the company’s shares up 37% from Monday’s close to a market value of almost $2.9 trillion, she said.

“We expect this fall’s launch to be the most significant iPhone event in years,” she wrote in a note to investors.

SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What new products or updates are you hoping to see from Apple? Join the conversation below.

In recent years, Mr. Cook has been stretching the iPhone lineup to appeal to an array of pocketbooks. That was on display again Tuesday: A step up from the iPhone 12 Mini sits the iPhone 12, starting at $799 with a 6.1-inch display. On the higher end, the iPhone 12 Pro starts at $999, with the Pro Max offering the largest display and beginning at $1,099.

The iPhone 12 and 12 Pro are available for pre-order on Friday, and the iPhone 12 Mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max will be available Nov. 6, Apple said.

Some analysts are skeptical that customers will flock to a 5G phone without a must-have application or service to help them see the appeal of the new technology. U.S. cellular networks are still being upgraded, and service might be disappointing in some spots for early adopters.

It is also uncertain how the coronavirus will affect sales of the new devices. The pandemic delayed production of the flagship phone earlier this year, which led Tuesday’s unveiling to be rescheduled from its traditional September date.

Mr. Cook appeared publicly for the first time since a Democratic-led House subcommittee last week issued a report claiming Apple uses its control over software on its devices in an anticompetitive manner. Apple has rejected the report’s conclusions and said it doesn’t have a dominant market share in any area.",7,0.6
2015-09-25 07:38:36,"If AAPL has over $200 billion in cash, why should the Fed raising interest rates influence their business and consequently lower their stock price?","Is it reasonable to think that higher interest rates would prompt consumers to save instead of spend more on iDevices?
 Wouldn't their business and thus their stock be better off than companies who typically need to borrow money to finance their capital or operations?

With this recent tech pullback, I was thinking about being invested 32% into AAPL, 32% into AMZN, 32% into MSFT, and 4% into more speculative and high risk stocks (for ex, TSLA and some other picks).

I firmly believe Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft aren’t going anywhere in the next 5 years but I plan to reassess this decision every year in case anything changes

I also don’t care if tech as an industry crashes tomorrow since my investing horizon is so long.

My goal is **maximal** ROI with a reasonably high risk tolerance. I considered investing into a tech ETF (such as VGT or QQQ) but I believe my returns will be much higher just by going with these 3 companies

2020-09-30 15:31:55,Monopolies and Peter Lynch on Beating the Market,"Hi all, this is just my personal opinion, let's get straight to the point:

Although most people don't realize it, there are monopolies all around us. I'm going to specifically focus on tech companies as they produce the highest returns (as far as I'm aware) and tech is the industry that I'm most familiar with (from real life), but this should also apply to any industry.

When I'm saying ""monopoly"", I don't refer to the economic definition of"" a company that's actively preventing competition"", but rather to the more lose definition by Investopedia of ""when a company and its product offerings dominate a sector or industry"". Also, we'll be focusing only on the US market and US  companies. General knowledge: ""a market share of greater than 50% has been necessary for courts to find the existence of monopoly power."" According to the US Department of Justice, so we'll go off of that 50% rule.

&#x200B;

Take Google, for example, a monopoly on search engines. According to an article from Visual Capitalist (published on Business Insider), Google and YouTube handle more than 90% of all internet searches (YouTube is owned by Google). Realistically speaking that's a monopoly.

Look at Amazon and the exact same things happen with e-commerce. According to marketer.com, Amazon has a 38.7% US market share. While this is certainly not above 50%, Amazon is still the most dominant player in online retail in the US by a huge margin.

Apple is without argument a ""monopoly"" on the US phone and (potentially) computer market. 

Microsoft is the outlier here because we're looking at it on a global scale but we can see according to statista.com, that it has a 72.9% Global market share of operating systems, thus it has a global monopoly on it.

So my analysis is not perfect, but you also have to remember that each company is well established, with good historical returns (stock wise, and I'm assuming income wise as well), and they all have a multitude of income sources.

&#x200B;

""Alright alright, you've made your point, so now what?"":

So let's assume that I believe that long-term these ""monopolies"" will remain as the dominant players, and because of that and other factors (believing in the company for example), I want to invest in them and only in them (assume GOOG, AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, 25% of the portfolio each).

Often people will say that diversification is an issue with an all tech portfolio, but backtesting for the past 15 years (which isn't that short) shows that tech simply beats the market. That leads me to the second part of the title about Peter Lynch. Lynch has said that ""in order to beat the index, you just take the worst performers out"". Sometimes this will come with more risk, sometimes not. So my question to you is, ignoring the debate about diversification, is there something else that I'm missing?

Here is a screenshot of the backtesting results, assuming you started with $10,000, rebalanced annually, and reinvested dividends. You can even see that the tech portfolio (Portfolio 2) has presumably less risk due to a higher shrape ratio of the SP500 (Portfolio 1): [i.imgur.com/tZl63Ej.png](https://i.imgur.com/tZl63Ej.png)

Thanks for any answers, I'll be happy to take questions as well.

EDIT:
A lot of people say that I've fallen prey to a bias of picking the best performers and then saying in hindsight why they were successful. So we found that the best performers are also tech monopolies (big deal). We also know in hindsight that these companies share (the same) other traits of success (like good revenue), but that's usually a by-product of the monopoly. Now, is it not reasonable to assume that if something is a tech monopoly that it'll play a big part in its success?
If that's a reasonable assumption, then the 4 companies I chose should (for the most part) continue being successful until their status as a monopoly, or something else that's drastic enough (like government intervention) will change. Also, I focus on tech because that's the field I'm most knowledgeable in, which by chance happens to be the be performing sector. I only want to invest in companies I understand.

EDIT 2:
For people saying that ""the returns on these companies aren’t good because they started out as monopolies, they started out small and grew to their position today, thus the high returns."" - Google already had a 56.3% market share in 2007 (digitalsuregeons.com), Amazon I'm pretty sure was always the significant player in US online retail (eBay is auctions not online retail, but still have been passed by Amazon), Apple had the most market share for a single company already in 2014 (Forbes), and Microsoft had a near 100% OS global market share already in 2010 (statista.com) and it even dropped a bit but their stock's performance is still great. Please note that these values fluctuate but it proves that except for apple, most of the backtesting period shows returns from times that these companies were already monopolies.",13,0.66
2017-01-28 13:41:56,Stock Analysis: Apple (AAPL),"**Company Overview**

Short version: They make iPhones.

 Long version: Apple Inc designs, manufactures, & markets mobile communication & media devices, personal computers, & portable digital music players, & sells a variety of related software, services, accessories, networking solutions, & third-party digital content. (Morningstar.com)                

**Note: All numbers come from Apple’s financial reports and probably are not completely up to date, but they more or less get the jist of it

**Bull Case (Catalysts)**
1. Apple is selling at a p/e of just under 15 (open for interpretation, see bear case) thus at least we can say it is at least reasonably valued. The main short term catalyst for the stock is the cash on its balance sheet. Apple has just over $230B of cash and $70B of debt. Even after subtracting debt from cash, they have about $160B in cash. Why does this matter? Imagine finding a stock that you think is reasonably valued at a p/e of 12 (on p/e alone you might buy it). But then you find out that it also comes with $4 cash/share. That comes like a bonus and it essentially makes the stock $4/share more valuable (intrinsically). But the problem is that over 90% of the cash is overseas. The good news is that Trump has promised to allow for repatriation of overseas cash at a low tax rate. Apple has approximately $43/share (or $30/share minus debt) in cash.

2. The iPhone 8. The bulls say that the 10 year anniversary rendition of the iPhone will be amazing and cause a super cycle where earnings grow dramatically again. 

**Bear Case (Industry headwinds)**

1. Apple is selling at a p/e of over 14, thus at least we can say it is at least not incredibly undervalued. The main issue is that about 63% (*edit thank you /u/JustAsIgnorantAsYou it is not 90%) of their revenues come from the iPhone. Apple has seen smartphone sales drop year over year and it is not inconceivable for this to be a continuing trend. Apple’s phones are pricey and the cheaper competition’s phones are getting better (no matter how much I hate Android…). In my opinion (and I’m an iPhone user) the future will have even less people willing to pay a substantial premium for a higher quality smartphone, instead more people will just choose the cheapest price (they’ll all be comparable anyways).


**Conclusion**

Apple faces industry headwinds of margin deterioration. Apple bulls would argue either one of two things: the declining iPhone demand is over-exaggerated and that the bears are not pricing in anything else that’s in the pipeline. The bears argue that - no, it really is that bad. Whether or not one makes an investment in Apple would depend on their views on these issues, as well as trying to factor in the potential short term catalysts in repatriation of overseas cash as well as the iPhone 8.

Purchase January 2017 LEAPS with a strike price of $120.00 at 4.55. It seems reasonable that the sudden drop in share price is a market overreaction to production concerns over the Iphone 6 and 6S. I believe that it is reasonable that AAPL will return to $120.00 before January 2017. Thoughts?

Edit: This is not meant to be the safest trade. However, the time horizon is over 1 year until expiration. Over the previous year AAPL has gone as high as $133. Part of why this trade is attractive to me is because the contract price is only $455 which provides significant upside if the strike price is exceeded. Is it that unreasonable that Apple may exceed $120 in the next year? Over the past month they've dropped nearly 10% on news that may or may not have already been priced in.",16,0.81
