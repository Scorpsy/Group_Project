I understand that solar isn't something most people are enthusiastic about. However, as a decades long solar industry veteran, I see something happening, and I feel like I have a responsibility to share it.

I am not a financial advisor, or even a professional trader. I don't want anyone to make any financial moves based off of my observations, especially since many of these observations are off the cuff, and the figures can be off. However, I would like to point some things out so that people much smarter than me could perhaps do the research.

Also, if I'm wrong on this and Sunworks is as good as the recent run up would imply, please, I urge you, let me know. I'm very much open to being wrong.

**Moving on, SUNW:**

* As of 2020, they had 16 sales reps and fewer than 100 employees, according to their SEC filing.
* SUNW accumulated deficit of -$88m at the end of 2020, compared to something like -$75m 2019, meaning their deficit is increasing, despite being well beyond a reasonable period of growth, having a receding market share, and having shown little/no profit for nearly two decades.
* SUNW currently has a market cap of $450m, and was a penny stock until end of 2020.
* SUNW completed fewer than 500 installs for the year of 2020, a decline from 2019, despite 2020 being a great year for solar sales in California. This is an incredibly low number of installs for a solar company that primarily operates in a State where solar is mandatory for all new homes. While I'm aware SUNW does a few commercial projects, it doesn't make up for the baffling lack of volume, particularly when the profit margins on residential are thicker than commercial.
* SUNW does not manufacture solar panels or equipment. SUNW does not develop any proprietary hardware or software to my knowledge. They are simply a solar reseller that operates off of debt, similar to RUN and NOVA, just on a much, much smaller scale, and similarly unprofitable.
* SUNW is facing serious headwinds on possible net metering changes in California, as well as interest rates (which fund their projects) increasing.
* SUNW is also facing headwinds of increasing shipping costs, as well as limited unit availability within the U.S.
* SUNW's biggest headwind is steep competition from much bigger companies with much greater firepower (meaning ability to offer lower prices and greater volume), such as RUN, NOVA, TSLA, and SPWR. Currently SUNW offers nothing unique to give them an advantage over their competition.
* SUNW's stock price seems to be benefiting solar hype in general, but with how far they're outpacing similarly classed solar companies, and with what appears to be literally no justification, it looks unusual at best.

Just for context, their biggest competitor RUN was established in **2007**, and has about **500,000 customers**.SUNW was established in **2002**, and has somewhere between an estimated **10,000 and 20,000** customers (data unclear).

**General Opinions:**

It's my belief that SUNW's run up is either a market inefficiency, uneducated solar fomo, or simply just a pump & dump. Please tread carefully. Buy it if you like it, don't if you don't.

My opinions on solar stocks, aside from SUNW: I believe the solar industry is great, especially with the average price per kwh being in a position to beat the U.S. average cost of power, and I believe there are many good solar stocks worth considering, especially with the federal tax credit having been extended last year. ENPH/SEDG are my top picks (American + Inverter suppliers). I think both SPWR and NOVA have some potential as retailers. FSLR, CSIQ, and JKS are each solid panel manufacturers, and SPRQ is a good solar financing company. If you're unfamiliar with the solar industry, the solar ETFs are a solid alternative.

My prioritization for the value of solar companies would be the following: Inverter Companies > Panel manufacturers > Financing Companies > Large retailers > Small retailers.

**Wrap up:**

Credibility: I'm pretty sure I have more solar customers than Sunworks.

Disclosure: I own a few Sunworks puts that I just bought Friday (less than half a percent of my portfolio), and will likely be buying more if it continues to climb without justification.

TLDR: SUNW doesn't make a profit, hasn't made a profit in over a decade, and doesn't appear to have any unique software, hardware, or business model.
