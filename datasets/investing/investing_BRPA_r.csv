2021-03-29 01:13:46,BREAKING: NeuroRX (BRPA) Announces Successful Phase 3 COVID Drug Trial Results,"Up until now, covid treatments have provided minimal efficacy, and that’s if given near the initial onset of the infection, where they have the highest probability of working.

Today, NeuroRX (Ticker:BRPA) has announced successful top line results from their phase 3 Zyesami drug trial, which proved a nearly 50 percent increase in survival and recovery from respiratory failure vs. existing covid treatments (best standard of care). And that’s when the drug is administered to patients that have already reached severe/critical covid.

**FDA Approval**

* NeuroRX is immediately applying for Emergency Use Authorization to get this drug to the people who need it. They already have a stockpile of the drug ready, along with manufacturing and distribution agreements. The CEO of NeuroRX has previously led drug developments for companies like Pfizer and Merck, and was appointed healthcare leadership roles by several different presidential administrations. He is the real deal.

**Nebulized form**

* The drug is administered via IV to hospitalized patients, however NeuroRX has already begun another trial to test an inhaled form of the drug, which is given via nebulizer and designed for use at home/outpatient setting. This could be even bigger than the IV form of the drug, because it could prevent moderately sick patients from ever becoming hospitalized in the first place. And now that the drug has proven it works in the IV form on severe/critical patients to reverse lung damage, the inhaled form which is administered directly to the lungs is even more promising for the moderately sick.

**“BuT cOviD is gOnE!!!!11”**

* While we’ve likely seen the worst of covid, it is not gone and never will be. Especially not in developing countries. Covid for example, is significantly more contagious than the flu. Even here in the US we might not reach herd immunity, plus mutations, people will get tired of getting a vaccine at least once, more likely twice a year etc.
* Additionally, the possible uses for this drug go beyond covid, such as respiratory distress syndrome. There are people who were on queue to receive a double lung transplant because of the damage covid did to their lungs, then were given this drug and a transplant was no longer needed. I believe covid treatment is only the beginning.
