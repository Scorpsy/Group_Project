A  company that came under my radar recently is OptimizeRx (OPRX). In the  following I want to present (1) an overview about the company and its  business, (2) some fundamentals with comparison to another  industry-related comparable stock and (3) an overall outlook for the  future.

**(1) Overview and business model**

OptimizeRx  operates as a digital health company that provides communications  solutions for life science companies,  physicians, and patients. Its  products and applications include  financial messaging, a virtual  patient support center that allows  doctors and staff to access sample  vouchers, co-pay coupons, and other  patient support through their EMR  and/or e-prescribe systems; and brand  awareness and therapeutic support  messaging services, such as brand  awareness messages, reminder ads,  therapeutic support messages, and  unbranded messages. The company also  offers brand support services,  which focuses on educating and working  with pharmaceutical manufacturers  on identifying, formulating, and  implementing new eRx media strategies,  including drug file integration,  sales force training, and strategy  development services for promoting  their products. In addition, it  operates cloud based Mobile Health  Messenger platform that provides  interactive health messaging for  enhanced medication adherence and care  coordination; and  HIPAA-compliant automated mobile messaging platform  that allows  pharmaceutical manufactures and related entities to directly  engage  with patients to enhance regimen compliance. Further, the  company  offers patient programs with treatment and affordability  information,  lifestyle and condition trackers, Internet device  connectivity, forms,  and surveys.

The most compelling  part of the company's business is there B2B platform. What do I mean  with this. So traditionally if e.g. a drug manufacturer like Pfizer or  JnJ develops a drug succesfully, that is only the first step. What makes  a new drug succesful is the distribution in the market, i.e. among the  actual doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, psychologists etc. Same goes with  new medical devices, e.g. by Thermo Fisher. After inventing and  developing them, they need to be rolled out by the respective company to  really cash in on this.

So  traditionally this was handled by agents. They were going to the  hospitals or pharmacies like WBA to offer them the company's products.  They were presenting the products using PowerPoint, buying them nice  lunch etc. to convince them of their new product. You can compare this  with an insurance agent who tries to find new customers for their  respective company to engage.

Well  this however, is no longer needed. OptimizeRX has developed a platform,  which allows companies to engage virtually with physicians, hospitals,  doctors, psychologists etc. to promote their product.

""When  a new treatment is available, it’s important to get the word out as  soon as possible so patients can benefit. The OptimizeRx platform is an  ideal communications network to accelerate awareness of a new brand or  to quickly spread the word during significant life-cycle events such as a  new indication. And with OptimizeRx, you can precisely target the  physicians, and their healthcare staff, that matter most. And you can  put your provider communications front and center in the EHR.""

I  always like to compare the company to Teladoc (TDOC). But while TDOC is  B2C (connects the buisness, i.e. hospital, doctor, psychologist etc.,  to the customer, i.e. patient). OPRX meanwhile approaches medical care  in a more B2B fashion, connecting the manufacturer of medical devices  and new drugs to the actual places where they get applied or sold  (hospitals, doctors, pharmacies etc.).

The  overall advantages should be clear, catalyzed by the Covid-19 pandemic  but to strengthen my point I want to give you some bullet points:

* While  it takes consumers/patients a change of habit to change from a analog  to a virtual platform which is always kind of connected to a certain  laziness (by human nature, we are a creature of habit who does not want  to change that quickly), businesses and enterprises are driven by hard  facts, i.e. time and money. So if there is a more cost effective way,  businesses will choose this way. And connecting virtually not only saves  money, it also saves time (remember, earlier the agent brought lunch  presenting his PowerPoint). No doctor has the time to do that.
* With  the OPRX platform the doctor/hospital/psychologist/pharmacist saves  time because he can find target-orientated solutions through the EHR.  Being more efficinet saves time. And saving time saves money.
* Health care is growing rapidly, more money will be spent on drug development. These drugs need to be promoted and sold.
* As far as I have found out there is no other (listed) company that provides a similar service.

**(2) Fundamentals, guidance and valuation**

OPRX  has a market cap of $797M as of writing this which makes it a small  cap. TTM revenue accounts for $43.3M which results in a P/S ratio of  18.4. Full year 2020 yoy rev growth was 76%, Q4 yoy rev growth was even  higher at 123%.

For the full year, operating income was a negative ($2,135M). Q4 operating income however was positive $1.356M.

So  what you can see overall, is that the metrics improved especially  lately. They increased revenue tremendously especially in Q4 with  posting positive operating income.

OPRX  didn't give explicit guidance. However, they set an aspirational goal  of $100M. But what really strikes me the most isn't the fact that they  will reach that, but how. Here's the part of the conference call  transcript:

*Analyst:  ""Okay, and then speaking of aspirations, I noticed you didn't give us a  year in which you're going to have $100 million in revenue. So we've  got a potential revenue of $100 million. I just wanted to dive into  that, you  have  talked  about  a  shift  to  more  subscription  type   revenue  or  current type revenue. In this  year where you do achieve  that $100 million in revenue, what percentage is subscription?""*

*William  Febbo (CEO): ""\[...\] Yes, we don't give guidance, so we don't put a date  on it. I think what's more important is we have the  team  to  get   there,  asidefrom  maybe  a  few  select  hires; so  that  should   scream,  we're  going  after  it hard. There's that leverage we keep  talking about""*

He also said: *""  In 2021, we expect to see a continued favorable shift to higher margin  recurring-revenue enterprise deals, and we believe our pipeline growth  has been driven by a permanent shift to more digital enablement.""*

So the key takeaway from this for me is that

(1) a large part of their revenue is recurring

(2) the recurring revenue is higher margin, which results in even more operating income

(3) their pipeline is really strong in 2021 [(see here)](https://investors.optimizerx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/optimizerx-recurring-revenue-grows-it-secures-19-new-enterprise)

(4)  they do not have to hire big time to leverage their platform. The  platform is there, now they can scale it which is cost efficient,  further increasing margins and operating income.

So overall they have strong numbers, they are scaling their business and there certainly is demand for their product.

However: A good company does not make it necessarily a good investment, if it's too expensive (even [Amazon.com](https://amazon.com/) was dead money for quite some time after the 01' crash).

So what I want to do is compare the valuation of OPRX to Teladoc (TDOC).

The  reason why I compare OPRX with TDOC specifically as mentioned above is  because both  are operating a virtual platform in healthcare, just on  different levels: while TDOC connects the doctor with the patient (B2C),  OPRX connects the manufacturer of medications, drugs, therapies,  medical devices etc  with the doctor/hospital/laboratory/pharmacies/etc  (B2B). Same thing, different level of operation.

So  TTM P/S ratio is 18.4 in comparison with Teladoc's $1.093B in revenue  on a market cap of $26.9B which results in a TTM P/S ratio of 24,6.

One  could argue that this valuation gap in favor of OPRX is because TDOC  grew their Q4 revenue 145% yoy while OPRX “only“ grew 123%.

However, there are several points mentioned above that make me pick OPRX over TDOC:

(1) OPRX is profitable, posting \~1.4 million in net income in Q4 alone while TDOC isn’t profitable

(2)  business model: connecting B2B is traditionally higher margin and more  recurring; also the argument I made above that companies will shift to  digital solutions quicker than ""humans"" when it is cost-saving while  humans still are kind of a creature of habit who prefer to go to the  doctor in person.

(3)  outlook  -> OPRX (admittedly vaguely) guided for 100 million revenue which  would be up \~130%. TDOC guided for  \~2bn in revenue which would be up  only \~83%.

So basically OPRX has

* cheaper multiples
* positive net income (!)
* higher projected growth

**(3) Future outlook and entry possibility**

So  I hoped to shed some light on OPRX, their business and their  fudnamentals. I am highly convinced by the business model and honestly  when I realized how drug manufacturers and medical device companies  promoted their products before in comparison to OPRX's solution it was  kind of eye-opening and thoroughly logical for me as no doctor or head  of a hospital wants to waste his time with a PowerPoint of a sales  agent.

The business shifted into  the next gear of course driven by the pandemic. It was the initial  booster. But from the statemtents during their [conference call](https://investors.optimizerx.com/static-files/8336b73a-4fd7-4ead-a8c3-f081c8063e68) about a month ago as well as the [latest press release](https://investors.optimizerx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/optimizerx-recurring-revenue-grows-it-secures-19-new-enterprise) you can be quite optimistic about the future of their business even afer the pandemic ends in 2021.

I  know the stock is richly valued. Look at the entire market. It ran 500%  yoy which I cannot deny is a good argument against investing right now  especialy if you are risk-averse. And certainly it is a small cap stock  which includes higher risk. But the business itself is high margin, high  growing, profitable and from my perspective uniquely positioned to  profit from a continued shift to digital solutions in a huge total  addressable market.

It recently  pulled back from a high of $64 to around $47.50 which is 25% off the  high. Given the (for you hopefully insightful) facts mentioned above  that was enough for me to enter a rather big position in OPRX yesterday.  And what in the end makes the most sense to me is not particularly a  financial but more of a common sense thought: The actual users of  medical devices and drugs do not have time for a sales agent. Why not  integrate it into an all around immersive platform. That is what OPRX  does.
