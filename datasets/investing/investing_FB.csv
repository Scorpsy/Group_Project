2021-01-27 14:02:43,FB earnings beat,"What a time we live in. One of the largest companies in the world posts earnings and not a single thread can be found but we do have plenty of meme ticker discussion :)

Here are the numbers. Great earnings and a 25 billion buyback approved. Sure there some regulatory pressure but this is a tremendous company and solid investment imo. 

Earnings: $3.88 per share vs $3.22 per share forecast by Refinitiv
Revenue: $28.07 billion vs $26.44 billion forecast by Refinitiv
Daily active users (DAUs): 1.84 billion vs 1.83 billion forecast by FactSet

2020-11-07 18:06:43,"I have AMZN, FB, and MSFT - I want to drop one and consolidate my positions into two. Which would you choose?","The case for AMZN - it can grow in so many directions and has surprised us time and time again.

The case for FB - leader in social networking. sure, they've maxed out on users, but they are opening other revenue streams with instagram.

The case for MSFT - just a steady beast. growth is not that sexy and has been a lame duck in my portfolio. Sure, Azure is hot, but it's competing with AWS, so I feel there's some duplication here. 

Honestly, I'm leaning towards dropping MSFT - getting greedy. The other side of me wants to keep MSFT because it's the ""safest"" out of the three.

Thoughts?

edit: My goal is to further consolidate my positions to accelerate growth. I have other positions but now evaluating these 3 at the moment.",164,0.8
2020-08-28 08:17:31,"With MSFT, AAPL AMZN, GOOGL and FB making up more than 1/5 of the S&P500, what are practical ways to de-risk your portfolio from this imbalance?","For those who subscribe to having the majority or the entirety of their equity holdings to consist of ETF/funds from the S&P 500, the impact to their portfolio as a function of any one company has increased substantially.

Even with total market funds like Vanguard's VTI, these five stocks make up an outsized portion of the fund because of market cap weight.  

Much like investors using ""ex-US"" funds to increase exposure to international holdings, are there funds that are ""ex-FAANG"" so individuals can lessen the impact?  If not, would another practical strategy be to buy more non-tech sector funds as opposed to say buy more of the 400+ other S&P 500 stocks as counterweight.

Thoughts?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**EDIT1:**  /u/exaggerate_a_point summed up my ask better than my own attempt so I'll add it here instead of responding to similar comments:

> OP specifically said he/she wants to de-risk, aka diversify. It's not about not holding good companies, it's about hedging the risk if one has a bad series of news or events. It's inherently risky if your portfolio is heavily weighted in a handful of companies.

Another good summary of the ask for this discussion from /u/FerociousGiraffe :

>Trying to move your portfolio away from FAANG isn’t to say those are great, successful, hugely profitable companies. You’d keep a position in them. It’s about protecting against news that will only hurt FAANG while not hurting the broader market.

**EDIT2:**  For comments related to balancing with international equities, this discussion is contained for U.S. equities.  Assume whatever percentage of bonds, precious metals, digital currency, international equities or whatever you think is appropriate in a portfolio has been addressed.

**EDIT3:**  Outside of suggestions like ""Why do you hate winning?"", some of the top solutions to dilute these stocks from your S&P 500 / U.S. equities part of a portfolio:

* Many suggest a variation of my original post of simply adding more sector funds outside of tech.  Though this strategy will unfortunately remove many non-giant tech companies in this sector.

* Many of you like /u/desquibnt suggests equal weighted ETFs like RSP.  However, RSP has a high net expense ratio of 0.20%.  

* /u/TriathlonNerd suggests a reverse cap weighted ETF like RVRS.  This too has a high net expense ratio of 0.29%.

* /u/BubbyginkESO and others suggests going broader than just 500 companies with low cost total market funds like Vanguard's VTI or Fidelity's FZROX.  While these 5 stocks still make up the top holdings, the effect of a larger basket of stocks also dilutes these companies.  So far, I like this simple and practical one the best.",1758,0.96
2020-09-22 08:23:35,"Video explaining the huge growth of large cap growth stocks (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, FB, GOOGL)","I've seen this question everywhere on this sub: ""why did apple/tesla/[insert large growth company name here] growth so much so quick! They still haven't made a lot of profit! We are in a bubble!""

Well, it is difficult to explain why to every person individually and this new video from Ben Felix explains the reason why expertly.

https://youtu.be/foqswJT3Spc

The conclusion the video comes to is that you should just stick to low cost index funds (preferably globally diversified) rather than investing into large cap growth or trying to find the next Apple or Amazon.

**EDIT:** The definition of a ""growth"" company (as literally explained in the video) is a company that is ""expensive"" relative to the market. Expensive how? Well, relative to some fundamental ratio like P/B or P/E. Considering all the companies I have listed in my title have relatively high P/E and P/B ratios, you can say they are expensive. This makes them by definition a growth company. This isn't that hard to understand. If I said they are tech companies, no one would argue because they literally are tech companies. Well, just as much as they are tech companies, they are growth companies. They might not all be as expensive as each other, but relative to the market, they are expensive.

I am not commenting about how all these companies are as overbought as each other, or they are the same in every metric, I just listed some large-cap growth companies based on the definition of growth being expensive.",962,0.91

2021-02-04 05:39:29,10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.  Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why:

1. THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, [https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq](https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq) .  The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work).  Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO.  A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs.  Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade.
2. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, [https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/](https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/) .  This ETF is... highly intriguing.  It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%).  They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM.  Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily).  What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology.  Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit.  The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO.  The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB.   SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF.  Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive.  Index methodology here: [https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf](https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf)
3. DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl) .  Its methodology is in the prospectus, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus) .  Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to [etfrc.com](https://etfrc.com). So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way.  Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ.  Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF!
4. SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund) . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change.""  ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s) ).  Methodology here: [https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index](https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index) .  It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in.  It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year!
5. FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, [https://freedometfs.com/frdm/](https://freedometfs.com/frdm/) . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores.  Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red.  If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like.  Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF.  Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox!
6. EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund) . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index.  Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil.  It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all).  Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung.
7. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf) .  One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets.  Really heavy on tech and luxury.  If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like.  High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH.
8. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, [https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html](https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html) .  Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options.  Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times.  Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF.  Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement.  Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X.
9. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, [https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx) .  Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries.  But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure.  Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund.  There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design.
10. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf) .  This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF.  You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise.  But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values.  Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk.  A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields.

ok, here's a bonus #11:

11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA) .  This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year.  But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted.  US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along.  Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector.

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future.

What do you guys think?  Any of those look like something you might invest in?  Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?

2021-01-24 05:09:56,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

2020-06-30 08:27:56,"Morgan Stanley says ad boycott is a buy opportunity for $FB, but less bullish on $TWTR","Over the past week, big advertisers like Unilever and Starbucks said they will join an advertising boycott of select social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter in response to what they say is a failure of these platforms to stop the spread of hate. The boycotts vary in length from just the month of July to year end 2020. Morgan Stanley (MS) estimates \~250 advertisers have joined the boycott to date, but only 13 of the largest 100 advertisers in the US.

MS says this is a good buying opportunity for FB because:

1. FB's ad dollar base is ""highly diversified"" - management said on its 1Q19 call that the top 100 advertisers represent less than 20% of total ad revenue. FB's advertiser base has likely grown by more than 10% and even more diverse since then (8m as of 4Q19 vs. 7mn in 4Q18);
2. FB has a strong direct-response (DR) transaction-driven ad product - DR advertisers will almost certainly step in and bid if/when pricing drops if large advertisers pull back on spend. DR advertisers spend is likely very strong now given the current momentum in e-commerce (growing at 50%+ vs. typically teens run-rate);
3. MS estimates every month of revenue lost from ALL top 100 FB advertisers = just \~1% of annual revenue and 3% of annual EPS.

MS sees more risk at TWTR from the boycott vs. FB because:

A) TWTR has a much lower total advertiser account (<1m advertisers vs. 8m at FB) which means more concentrated ad dollar base and more vulnerable if/when the largest advertisers pull back on ad spend.

B) TWTR does not have the same scaled direct response offering that FB has, which means there would be fewer “always on” e-commerce and transaction-based ad dollars available to step in to bid around any weakness in the auction market.",70,0.85
2020-08-20 20:30:54,FB is undervalued among FANGAM companies. Thoughts?,"I'm sitting on a War chest of 34K and feeling like I missed the train in March. After carrying out much research on the current valuations of FANGAM I have narrowed down to invest a 10% in FB. The recent analysis from Valuation Master Mr.  Ashwanth Damodharan also provided the same thoughts on FB.  
What do you think about the valuation analysis? I know the time in the market always beats timing the market. Hence I'm planning to DCA rather than investing as a lump sum.

- Corsair (CRSR) : had stellar earnings and they make fantastic products in the gaming and PC hardware space.  They're making good acquisitions in the streaming space.  

- Salesforce (CRM) : another solid company that has taken a big beating for no apparent reason.  They recently acquired Slack and I dont see any other competitor being remotely close in the CRM space. 

- Square (SQ): revolutionizing payments for small businesses.  

- Cloudflare (NET): yet to turn profitable but a great tech company that is growing rapidly. 

- Snowflake (SNOW): another tech company that was overvalued upon IPO and climbed all the way to $429 before being brought back to earth.  Currently trading at  $213

- Costco (COST): solid company that has a loyal following and great business model.  

- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM): market leader in chip manufacturing and with the current shortage in chips,  their future looks great. 

- Teladoc (TDOC): one of the big companies in the telemedicine space that should thrive in the post covid world as more patients want the convenience of seeing their doctor from the comfort of their own home. 

- Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY): pharma giant that made key acquisitions recently (Celgene and Myokardia) that should boost their pipeline and revenue.  Also pays good dividend. 

- Facebook (FB) : social media giant that isn't going away anytime soon.  Would be interesting to see how they leverage Oculus to boost their revenue.  

- CVS (CVS) : pharmacy giant that should get a boost from covid vaccine rollout and their new in-house clinics. 

- Tattooed Chef (TTCF): fast growing company in the plant based protein and healthy frozen foods space.  They have products in almost all major retailers and are rapidly expanding.  

- Nvidia (NVDA): leader in GPU space and a tech giant.  

- Palantir (PLTR): big data company with a revolutionary product that is just getting started.  

- Qualcomm (QCOM): makes chips for phones and are well established for the 5G Era

- American Tower Corp (AMT): they make/ rent out cell signal towers and should benefit from the move to 5G

- Planet13 Holdings (PLNHF): they make giant superstores for Marijuana sale and are set to have their own brand of products 

Of course I would also add Apple, Visa, Microsoft, and Amazon if they dipped enough. 

What stocks did I miss?  Are there any others you would suggest keeping an eye on during the recent sell-off?  Thank you!",33,0.9
2020-10-06 08:18:38,"$AMZN, $GOOGL, $FB - RBC data suggests Amazon biggest gainer of ad share","RBC:

""RBC & Ad Age surveyed over 700 advertising professionals – marketers, agency representatives, marketing consultants & media companies. We believe this constitutes one of the broadest Internet Advertising surveys out there. And we track the Advertising Troika: Current Budget Allocations, Future Spend Intentions & ROI Perceptions. **We increasingly view these survey results as indicative of trends for larger Brand-oriented advertisers.**""

""1. **Evidence of a Modest Recovery**: Looking at how marketers plan to adjust their Online Ad spend over the next 12 months, 61%/6% plan to increase/decrease, up slightly from 60%/7% in April but below the 67%/3% from last year. We believe there is a lag effect here given our last survey was taken while ad budgets were in major flux during late March / early April.

2. **High Social Commerce Adoption, Notable Social Media (SM) Ad Boycott Impact**: 42% of SM advertisers said they had spent some budget on Social Commerce tools (e.g. Facebook Dynamic Product Ads, Instagram Shopping Ads, etc.), which we view as intrinsically high and especially bullish for FB & PINS. Meanwhile, a meaningful 33% of digital marketers halted or reduced spend on SM because of recent ad boycott campaigns, which may help explain the downtick in SM allocations and directionally negative results for FB and INSTA. All in, we tend to view the boycott results as generally backwards looking and Social Commerce results as more forwards looking. We continue to expect minimal impact to FB’s fundamentals from the boycotts given their advertiser base of 9MM.

3. **‘Net Remains A Key Marketing Channel**: 76% of marketers (vs. 75% last year) allocate >20% of their budgets to Online, and a Record High (RH) 42% allocation 50%+ to Online. This 42% of respondents allocating over half their budgets to Online marks the 13th consecutive new RH allocation in this bucket of spend and supports our view that incremental ad spend will continue to go to Online channels.

4. **FB & GOOGL Properties are ROI and Budget Allocation Leaders**: When asked to rank order Online Ad platforms based on ROI, marketers continue to place GOOGL and FB well ahead of peers, with GOOGL moderately increasing its lead over FB. Platform partners YouTube and Instagram rounded out the top four with Twitter, LinkedIn and Amazon trailing, respectively. In terms of Budget Allocations, 38% of marketers allocate over 20% of their Online Ad Spend to Google (vs. 38% in April), ahead of Facebook at 37% (flat vs. April). These levels are much higher than other platforms. 76% (+1pt Y/Y) of marketers allocated some Online spend to INSTA with 75% (+2pts Y/Y) allocating some to YouTube, tho both had sequential allocation declines. In terms of Future Spend Intentions, Amazon had the most positive skew for the first time in survey history with 52% of its marketers planning to increase spend vs. only 3% planning to decrease. After Amazon, the skew was most positive with Google, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, then Pinterest, with Facebook, Twitter and Snap lagging.

5. **And The Trends: Strongly Positive for AMZN & PINS, Incrementally Negative for FB & INSTA, Modestly Positive for GOOGL & YT, and Neutral-to-Negative for TWTR & SNAP**: AMZN is now the #1 ranked platform in terms of Future Spend Intention (vs. #3 in April and #5 last year) and the #1 ranked Perceived ROI platform (vs. #3 last survey). It was one of two platforms to show six and twelve month improvements in these metrics and was the largest sequential gainer in both of these categories. Super Bullish. PINS was the other platform with six and twelve month gains in Future Spend Intention and Perceived ROI skew, including record best results in both categories (see Exhibit 14). FB & INSTA were undeniably negative with group high deteriorations in Future Spend Intention skew (both down 11pts vs. April) and a RL +6% Perceived ROI skew for FB. GOOGL led Top 5 platforms in terms of Future Spend Intent and Perceived ROI, showing a sequential increase in the % of respondents indicating improved ROIs. TWTR results were more neutral than anything (tho intrinsically weak) while SNAP was negative, posting deterioration in these two metrics and Future Spend Intention skew turning negative.""",19,0.76

1. Anti-trust debate - the benefits of large companies is being clearly demonstrated during this crisis - FB's apps enabling the sharp increase in communication, AMZN's logistics delivering critical goods to consumers, innovative health apps and 1m masks/week from AAPL. The rise of TikTok and Zoom also illustrate large companies are not stifling competition. In fact, they have allowed Americans (voters) to live better lives during this pandemic.
2. Privacy debate - data collection has driven rapid innovation during COVID (e.g. thermometer apps tracking virus spread across the US by location). Countries that appear to have greatest success at containing COVID-19 also have the most aggressive data gathering tools (e.g. China, Singapore).
3. fake news debate - FB and GOOGL have been proactively taking down false info during COVID-19, which appears to be helping their case to policy makers.

Finally, rather than furloughing employees, these big tech companies are hiring and helping to mitigate the economic stress during this crisis.

Policy makers trying to push US toward EU-style regulation are likely to face a harder time post COVID-19.",193,0.88

2021-01-31 09:48:29,"Is Facebook's moat widening or shrinking? My unorganized thoughts, do you see any flaws?","**Hardware:**

I think the smartest defensive move Facebook can make at this stage is doing whatever it takes to become a major player in consumer hardware. Even if they breakeven, or lose money on this endeavor it can be treated as user acquisition costs for the people who wouldn't make a Facebook account otherwise, or as a way to make Facebook accounts as sticky as possible to protect against people leaving the platform. Anecdotally, I've seen **people that have preached ""Facebook is evil"" for years, say that not they will not ever delete their newly open accounts** because if they did their Oculus hardware wouldn't work, and they'd lose all of their purchases.

Facebook is dominating the growing VR market with an iron fist. **Non-advertising revenue grew 156%** in Q4, and IDC estimates 3 million [Quest 2's were sold in Q4](https://twitter.com/somospostpc/status/1354879840097337349). Oculus Quest 2 has stellar reviews, despite the mandatory Facebook account for use. Facebook's VR devices also use Messenger for messages, Workplace for enterprise, and I believe [Facebook Horizon](https://www.oculus.com/facebook-horizon/) (which is integrated with the FB app) will eventually be the place users load into initially, and launch third party apps from.

High investment cost makes it unlikely that other social media company can compete with Facebook in hardware (especially AR/VR), and this should give Facebook a permanent utility advantage against its peers. The companies that could compete, big tech, and gaming giants seem unwilling to make the investment to compete. I think they're aware that Facebook is completely fine making $0 to be dominant in the VR space, and that's scared them away in addition to facts like VR being a relatively small market for them.[Apple is rumored to be considering a release of a Quest-like headset in later 2022, but the device will be priced far above $1000 according to Mark Gurman.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses)

VR is where I'm most confident in Facebook's ability to achieve its hardware dreams, but consumer AR is also an area where its only competition in terms of investments made is Apple. So I think their chances there are decent too. Facebook is working on long term AR glasses, but is also releasing Smartglasses in collaboration with Luxottica (Ray-Ban and Oakley) this year. There's also Facebook's line of smart video chatting devices, Portal.

**Traditionally Listed Moats**

Intangible assets consisting of the vast amount of data users have shared: **sustained and growing**, but people are also sharing things about themselves on other apps increasingly.

Growth of users means **network effects still growing**

Number and diversity of advertisers, and advertiser verticals **still growing**

**Competition?**

There is rising social media competition, and always the threat of new entrants. That being said, competition seems to carve out niches, so they aren't competing as directly as we'd think. The closest thing to Facebook the Blue app, for connecting with family and friends is Instagram. Competing apps can have similar features, but the main utilities are different. Tik Tok is mostly a short video app, Youtube is a long video app, Twitter is a breaking news app, Reddit is a communities app, etc. **Facebook's utility first and foremost is connecting with REAL people who's identity you can verify, like friends and family. Like previously mentioned, the closest competitor is Instagram.**

**Messaging**

There can be lack of differentiation here, but **Messenger tied to Facebook, Instagram, Portal and Oculus.** I suspect it'll be tied to future hardware as well. Whatsapp has network effects, and may one day have lock-in comparable to Chinese super apps (at least that's what's being worked towards). iMessage is the the main competitor here, because they are automatically installed on every iPhone

**Misc**

I think Facebook Marketplace, the Craigslist alternative **benefits greatly from Facebook using real identities**, and is an overall better product. If you want to sell something locally FB Marketplace is the best option, and I think it's a strong reason to have an account. Usage of Marketplace is growing.

The integration with Jio in India, and importance in Indian society is worth mentioning for Whatsapp.

Facebook Groups, have competition in the form of Reddit, and Discord. The edge here will be real identities, and the tools they are building to make moderating a Facebook group profitable (subscriptions, etc)

The only other pure ""Real Identity social network"" is Linkedin is a professional network.

**Problems**

**No young people use Facebook?** This seems to be a US centric cliche, as Facebook is popular among all age demographics around the world. [According to Pew Research 76% of people 18-24 use Facebook](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/10/share-of-u-s-adults-using-social-media-including-facebook-is-mostly-unchanged-since-2018/), only superseded by Youtube. For teens in 2018, [51% of teens used Facebook](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/05/31/teens-social-media-technology-2018/) which is good in my opinion for a social network not targeted to teens like Tik Tok. I personally think the utility of Facebook kicks in after college age, **but regardless if there is a problem, I think the cure can be User Acquisition through hardware.**

**Chance of mass exodus?** again, **mitigated by the lock-in of hardware**, but this is a concern of mine based on Facebook's reputation. **1. Privacy**, there is truth to some criticism here, because Facebook's business model does depend on data collection, and in many ways is opposed to strict definitions of privacy, but much of it is also pushed by myth like ""Facebook sells data"". **Facebook has the same business model as its advertising funded peers, but perception is what matters,** and Facebook is losing the perception battle. **2. Politics,** In my opinion has been half of Facebook's reputation problem. Recently Zuck said that **they are trying to make Facebook less political by not recommending political groups, and lowering reach on political posts**. Also, Donald Trump being gone should make the next 4 years less politically controversial. Since Facebook is in the business of advertising, and people can mostly say what they want, **there's always the small chance of a #DeleteFacebook movement reaching critical mass based on these themes.**

**Being banned in countries?** Mitigated **by becoming a hardware player,** but this is an unlikely outcome for many reasons that my hands are too tired to elaborate on.

**Apple's privacy stance and iOS 14:** The hit to revenue estimates I've seen are between 1%-7%, but it could also be a boost to revenue **since third party signals being reduced will give the edge to whoever has the best first party signals**, we'll have wait to see. This is something to watch closely, but transferring third party data into first party data by having ecommerce on the platform through initiatives like **Facebooks shops, and Instagram shopping can be the cure**. Also, **being in control of hardware mitigates this risk**

**Antitrust-** generally **not concerned**

**Privacy as a theme that is adversarial to advertising -** slightly concerned but **I don't think ad funded business models are going anywhere**, many people like not paying for things

**Might add more to this later...**",94,0.89

For context, there are currently 160m businesses using FB (out of \~800m global SMBs), and only 8m of them actually advertise on the FB platform. If FB is able to make the user shopping experience more seamless, SMBs will find more reasons to pay for ads.

2020-09-29 07:20:50,"$GOOGL, $FB, $SNAP - Barclays and Jefferies see continued digital ad recovery","Barclays:

""**Our checks point to continued improvement in demand across the digital advertising sector in 3Q**, albeit at a slower pace of acceleration than what we saw intra-quarter last quarter. We think growth rates across the industry are increasing “mid-single digits” in 3Q from the 2Q exit trajectory. Direct response advertisers continue to follow the consumer conversions, which are broadly stable (flat). Digital brand advertising is picking up more meaningfully in 3Q on the back of the return of sports. Against this backdrop we remain constructive on the advertising names in our coverage, we think most are running ahead of consensus in 3Q/4Q. Improving growth is also a great lever for EBITDA margins (especially at larger fixed-cost businesses like Google) - digital advertising has nearly 100% incremental margin on every dollar of revenue, hence we should see a nice reversal upward in margin cadence for most names as the recovery continues, now through 2021.""

""The Stock Set-ups (**Recommend Adding FB/SNAP**): Against this bullish backdrop we are revising up revenue estimates to reflect our outlook for 3Q and 4Q for each name in mobile advertising. We think the larger cap names (FB/GOOGL) should post modest upside to consensus, and largely in-line with buyside expectations, while we think small cap names (SNAP/PINS/TWTR) could report more meaningful beats. We want to add to positions in FB and SNAP into the print.""

Jefferies:

**""YouTube Expert Call Recap: Pricing Rebounds on Ad Budget Flush** Key takes from our call with marketing tech exec specializing in YouTube: 1) YT pricing up \~1/3 from trough and as much as double for premium targeted inventory; 2) 2020 ad budgets, espec. from linear TV, looking to spend quickly on elections and Covid relief in Q3, followed by holiday shopping in Q4; 3) brand spend returning but still some hesitations; 4) YT shopping ads are good, but FB ads are better; 5) more below. GOOGL remains a top LC pick.""

""We hosted a call with the head of sales at a martech co that specializes in YouTube and social media ad spend (roughly 70:30 mix). Replay here. Key takes:""

""• **YouTube (YT) ad pricing has seen a significant recovery**. YT pricing has rebounded from Covid-trough levels and is now close to Q1 levels. On an equivalent CPM basis (from CPV prices), pricing troughed at \~$9-11, but is now at \~$12-15 (up 35% at the mid-point). For some specific, targeted YT inventory, such as geolocation-based (say for competitive election races), pricing can be as high as $17-20 or roughly double the bottom levels.

• **Brand spend returned in Q3.** Recall that GOOGL highlighted brand headwinds as a factor in YT rev deceleration in Q2 to 6% y/y from 33% in Q1. Our expert noted big CPG & other clients have come back in Q3, although not yet to a full recovery.

• **Ad budget flush potentially playing out.** There are several pockets of ad spend that are looking to be deployed quickly. These include: political/PAC money, covid relief funds allocated by states to local governments to promote economic recovery, upfront money for linear TV that is shifting to digital channel, and, later in Q4, advertising for holiday shopping.

• **Video ad spend shifting from linear TV to digital.** The pandemic has upended 2020 linear TV ad budgets, with many advertisers finding it hard to spend committed upfront budgets. Live events have been cancelled or delayed, and many rescheduled events are not drawing enough rating points. As a result, large advertisers are shifting to YT, CTV, and programmatic digital channels that have scale, measurability, and targetability.

• **Optimistic on 2021, but limited visibility so far**. While our expert was optimistic on 2021 YT & CTV trends, no clients are planning for 2021 yet as they are still focused on month-to-month spend.

• **YT has more work to do around e-commerce.** YT shopping ads were in beta in Q2, and some clients are using it. However, they have not done as well as FB Shopping ads. Google's ad tech is still complex, especially for SMBs.

• **YT more skewed to enterprise than small business.** Most of YT's ad spend still comes out of larger clients. This is in contrast to FB, which has 9M+ active advertisers, with the top 100 only accounting for 16% of rev.

• **FB vs. TikTok?** In short form video, our expert likes Instagram Reels a lot, and expects to see buyable ad units in the next 6 mos. While clients are interested in TikTok, engagement quality and CPMs have been low.

• **TWTR needs more than ads?** Both ad platform/tech and content safety issues need more work. A subscription model may be required, given the challenges on the ad side.

**GOOGL still a top large cap pick** \- trading at 12x CY21 EV/EBITDA and up only 9% YTD, trailing other megacap tech.""",2,0.57
2020-04-21 11:00:11,"$FB, $GOOGL: Latest data suggests digital ads bottomed in mid-Mar, improving in Apr","According to a Raymond James report this morning, the latest data confirm ongoing weakness for digital ads, but trends appear to have bottomed in mid-Mar, and improved in Apr. However, the improvements were very category specific, with eCommerce seeing much stronger trends but sustained weakness for restaurants, broader SMB category, and travel.

Analyst checks indicate a 33% cut to overall planned digital ad spend for the year. Specifically, brand advertisers are expected to cut the most, including travel (-69%), traditional retail (-56%), restaurants (-49%), autos (-49%), and fashion/apparel (-26%). Categories seeing the least impact include cosmetics, household products, online retail, healthcare, politics, alcohol, gaming, telecom, baby/child/parents, and pet supply. Among advertisers surveyed, vast majority believe the impact will be ""substantially more negative"" or ""somewhat more negative"" than the 2008/2009 cycle.

Street is likely to continue cutting estimates for all digital advertisers, but some appear to be better positioned than others. $GOOGL is estimated to have 10-15% exposure to travel and SMB is 20-30% of its ad spend, but eCommerce also represents 40% of search. $FB has very high exposure to SMB (7m advertisers and 90m business pages), but it is also seeing the biggest pickup in eCommerce spend. $TWTR, $SNAP, and $TTD are all highly exposed to brand advertising, so their outlook may be more challenged. $CDLX is probably the weakest of them all because it has very high exposure to restaurants, travel, and retail.",108,0.91

2021-01-07 15:37:36,My 2021 Portfolio,"Albeit a week late, I want to share my 2021 portfolio for documentation purposes and for whoever is interested. I aimed to balance risk in this portfolio with some growth names and legacy plays. Down to brass tacks, I am putting my money in the highest quality companies (in my view) across a diverse set of industries I find attractive. Some of these names are overvalued in the short term. However, I have realized I am not in the business of beating Wall Street’s pricing, but would rather hold high-quality companies that I believe will grow faster that the market in the long term. In other words, I am totally fine paying a short-term premium for growth and quality. Below is a summary of the portfolio and big picture reasoning behind each investment. I'm definitely open to any feedback.

**ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (BATS: ARKG) -** Invests in companies advancing genomics. The companies held in ARKG may develop, produce or enable: CRISPR, Targeted Therapeutics, Bioinformatics, Molecular Diagnostics, Stem Cells, Agricultural Biology.

* Innovative industry. Since 2003 the cost to sequence a human genome has dropped from nearly $3bn to less than $1,000. ARK believes that as costs continue to drop, genomic sequencing will become a standard of care in oncology. It will introduce more science into  healthcare decision making, enable personalized medicine, and accelerate drug discovery. ARK estimates that genomic sequencing revenues will grow 43% at an annual rate, from $3.5bn last year to $21bn in 2024.
* Cathie Wood. She’s a beast stock picker. Out of all the  ETFs she runs, her closest competitor trailed by 60%. Her worst ETF still  doubled investors' money. Her strategy is to make investments into companies that she considers incredibly transformational and she has seen success doing it.

**CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) -** Cybersecurity technology company that provides endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyber attack response services. 

* Best in class technology. Remember about a week ago a bunch of Russian hackers breached SolarWinds? The same hackers also tried to hack CrowdSrike at the same time but were unsuccessful. I’ve wandered on to a bunch of cybersecurity forums, and the general consensus is CrowdStrike has developed the best cybersecurity solution by miles. CRWD is the undisputed leader in cybersecurity. 
* “Pick-and-shovel” investment into the world’s increasing digitization. Even in the absence of COVID, cybersecurity remains a key component of the world’s increasing digitization as cyberthreats have been an ongoing issue from the onset of the internet. In the last decade we have seen a bunch of hacks where companies have exposed sensitive customer information. It seems companies are just starting to realize the importance of cybersecurity.

**Disney (NYSE: DIS) -** Worldwide entertainment company that you all are probably familiar with.

* Reopening trade. In 2019, parks generated 45% of total operating income for DIS. Full reopening and attendance in parks will be slow, but certainly benefit DIS when it happens. The company has been executing on several other segments in the meantime (i.e. streaming). It has proved competitive, increasing the margin of safety if parks take longer to reopen.
* Fast-growing streaming division. DIS has proved agile as it successfully launched a streaming service, Disney+, that has already gained 86mn+ subscribers which was the company’s original 5 year target. This is promising as it shows management can adapt to rapidly changing technology trends.

**Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH) -** Designs and manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control.

* Shift to clean energy; ENPH emerging as market leader. Going into 2021, sentiments towards solar have been at an all time high. This trend is expected to continue, especially after the Georgia run-off results. Solar firms are expected to benefit from extended tax incentives on both the consumer and producer ends.
* Technological advantage. ENPH has developed the industry leading solution and is rapidly taking market share from its primary competitor, SolarEdge. Pricing reflects this, but it's expected to continue. Among key competitors, Enphase has been one of the lowest cost producers. Its low-cost structure is a major contributing factor to its improving margins.

**Evolution Gaming Group (OTC: EVVTY) -** Swedish company that develops, produces, markets and licenses integrated B2B live casino solutions for gaming operators. 

* Early mover advantage. Evolution’s lack of competition enables it to rapidly grow in new markets and create a loyal customer base, with high switching costs. The company has effectively grown EBITA margins from 41.6% in 1Q18 to 64.8% in 3Q20. Margin expansion is expected to continue.
* Massive untapped markets. Europe is estimated to be around $2.5bn (EVVTY has 50% market share), Asian market is \~15x the size of Europe (150% YoY growth for EVVTY in Asia). North America’s market is \~$210mn, a 42% increase YoY, with NJ and PA the only states currently operating (NY looks promising). Management thinks the US will be the largest in the long-term. 
* Undetected from Wall Street. Evolution has almost no analyst coverage in the US and very minimal coverage in Europe, presenting opportunity for additional growth as institutional money managers recognize this opportunity and draw attention to the stock. Additionally, Evolution has a founder-led management team that is highly aligned with shareholders (mgmt owns over 30% of the stock).

**Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) -** Enables people to connect through devices. It’s products include Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and Oculus. 

* Zuck. It’s not a question of who is the next Jobs/Bezos/Gates/Zuck, because Zuck is super young. He has a history of being able to execute: IG acquisition / transition from desktop to mobile /  denying multiple acquisition opportunities in his twenties. 
* Undervalued. FB is the cheapest among the FAANG stocks, yet has some of the highest growth rates. This is mainly because of its continuous political scandals. With Trump out of office, I think FB has a chance to stay out of trouble and start to realize higher multiples.  The antitrust lawsuit is not a threat imo, it is actually an opportunity. If the govt forces FB to break up, we would get shares in the spin-offs, which would be valued at a higher multiple than FB. For example, if Instagram spun off from FB and traded at the same multiple as SNAP, Instagram’s market cap would be larger than FB’s.

**Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ: RDFN) -** Provides residential real estate brokerage services. 

* Digitization of Real Estate (i.e. “iBuying”). Technology in RE is moving from being informational to transactional. Redfin’s iBuying service is dubbed “RedfinNow.” The service basically buys homes from sellers looking for a quick and convenient sale (close deals within 10-30 days). This segment isn’t profitable yet as it is just getting started, but promising as the management adapts to technology trends.
* Inter-US Migration and housing outlook. People are moving out of the cities because of COVID / trying to avoid taxes / etc. which increases demand for Redfin’s services. With interest rates extremely low (and no expectation for them to increase), homebuying demand should continue to grow.
* RDFN most attractively valued compared to Z and OPEN, with the most upside potential given its market cap \~$7bn. Some are predicting RDFN might start offering rental services as well. RDFN has the best LT margin potential. 

**Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC) -** Provides virtual healthcare services on a B2B basis to its clients and provides services to consumers directly and through channel partners.

* Competitive positioning in industry ripe for disruption. Healthcare is a huge market yet to be significantly disrupted. COVID has accelerated this disruption. Providers who were once opposed to telemedicine now realize its benefits and several regulatory changes are promising for telemedicines growth potential. Medicare and other government-sponsored coverage is expected to include telemedicine benefits, increasing TDOC’s TAM.
* Livongo acquisition. From the consumer POV, this will increase access to healthcare at a lower cost. Teladoc will have access to a larger amount of data it can interpret to refine its services and monetization strategies. 

**Sea Ltd (NYSE: SE) -** Digital entertainment, electronic commerce, and digital financial services. The Company operates three business segments: Garena, Shopee, and SeaMonkey. The Company’s digital entertainment business, Garena, is a global game developer and publisher with a presence in Southeast Asia, Taiwan, and Latin America. Garena provides access to mobile and personal computer online games. Shopee provides users with a shopping environment that is supported by integrated payment, logistics, fulfillment, and other value-added services. SeaMonkey business is a digital financial services provider. SeaMonkey offers e-wallet services, payment processing, credit related digital financial offerings, and other financial products. 

* Diversified consumer internet company with market-leading position. Sea caters to Southeast Asia and Taiwan, providing its online gaming, e-commerce, and payment platforms. Shopee has overtaken competitors, it is widening its market share lead. ESports is a rapidly growing market (15.7% YoY to $1.1bn in 2020) and Sea is outpacing market growth.
* Pay for quality. The best companies keep going up for years in a row, and I think Sea is in the early stages of being classified as such a company. It’s worth $100bn but has effectively proved its ability to identify opportunities and expand business lines. 
* Still early stages of developing its consumer banking business, so we get the security of a bigger, established company with upside for an additional, lucrative business line such as fintech.

**Waste Connections Inc. (NYSE: WCN) -** Waste services company that provides non-hazardous waste collection, transfer, disposal and recycling services. 

* Recession resilient; re-opening trade. The waste management industry is recession resilient, it will always be around. 
* Non-hazardous waste collection. With a progressive government likely to push climate initiatives, recycling and non-hazardous waste collection are likely to benefit on the back end.
* WCN has a large moat; there isn’t much of a competitive threat the way the industry operates. Management’s strategy is to generally only spend what FCF is available. This enables the company to make acquisitions while handling its debt load. Great for stable growth.

&#x200B;

2021-02-23 09:19:47,"Vy Global Growth, VYGG - Reddit Merger","Vy Global Growth, VYGG - Reddit Merger

**Linking everything together**

* Reddit last valued privately at $6B.
* Generally SPACs can do a merger with a company up to 10x the capital pool.
* VYGG raised 575M. This would likely give Reddit an IPO valuation of 7-8B.
* Alexander Tamas is an expert on social media/internet businesses.
* Tamas previously invested in FB, Twitter, Reddit, and [Mail.ru](http://mail.ru/). His VC fund, Vy Capital, owns some percentage of Reddit. Specific ownership stats not disclosed.
* Steve Huffman, Reddits Co-founder and CEO, is on the Vy Global Growth Board of Directors. He is not affiliated with any other SPAC.
* The VYGG prospectus specifically allows the Sponsors including Vy Capital to “self-deal” which allows them to bring one of the companies they have previously invested in public.
* Tamas has a promote worth over 140M which will only be awarded if a business combination happens.
* Reddit is a founder-led social media technology company with 52M daily active users and 440M monthly active users. Exactly the kind of business laid out in the VYGG prospectus.
* If Reddit can successfully monetize that audience it could be worth hundreds of billions someday.
* Steve Huffman’s goal is to offer every person an opportunity to join communities that they align with. He dislikes instagram/facebook and wants to enable people to interact with each other “authentically”.
* Reddit had job openings for their IPO readiness team until Febuary 8th, 2021. They filled their last position which was the leader of the IPO readiness team. This means their entire IPO team is now complete and working on putting their IPO deal together.
* This means Reddit is ready to go public and now, because of VYGG, has an easy and fast way to get into the public market.
* It usually takes between 30 and 90 days from the SPACs letter of intent to the actual merger date, so this could happen over the next six months.
* On Febuary 8th, 2021, Vy Capital led a 500M round on Reddit which can be considered a pre-IPO round. This round gives it’s current investors the ability to go to their clients and show them good returns. It also boosts the valuation so when Reddit goes public it doesn’t do a 3x on valuation from 3B to 8-10B, but from 6B to 8-10B. - Much easier to sell to the public investors.
* This funding round also gave its current shareholders the opportunity to buy more of its shares right before it goes public.
* The money raised is going to be put towards attracting advertisers and brands, building its workforce by doubling its staff, and expanding internationally. This can be considered a story round where Reddit is projecting a future as a multi-billion dollar advertising social media business. Exactly the type of business that gets crazy price/sales multiples in the current market environment.

**How each Member of the BOD fits into helping Reddit Grow**

* Alexander Tamas - CEO at Vy Capital, Chairman at Vy Global Growth - Social media and internet business expert. Just led a 500M fundraising round on Reddit.
* John Hering - CEO at VYGG - Cyber security expert. Lots of experience scaling online platforms to millions of users. Strong aversion to the misuse of data. Fits with Reddits values.
* Hugo Barra - Board Member at VYGG - Experience with expanding technology companies userbase internationally (Xiaomi). VP of VR at Facebook. Scaled Android OS to more than a billion users. Fits with social media narrative.
* Justin Kan - VYGG Board Member - Founder of [Twitch.tv](http://twitch.tv/). Social media expert. Scaled [Twitch.tv](http://twitch.tv/) to more than 200 million users. Has been friends with Steve Huffman for over 15 years. Was in the first Y-combinator round along with Steve Huffman. Would be a useful Board Member for Reddit.
* Steve Huffman - Founder & CEO of Reddit - Is putting the pieces in place for a Reddit IPO (probably through the SPAC process). Finished putting Reddit’s IPO readiness team together on Febuary, 9th 2021.

**Investment Case**

1. Worst case: I’m wrong and VYGG doesn’t merge with Reddit. They fail to find a decent business combination and the cash in the trust is returned to the shareholders. Currently it is expected that around $10.01 of cash is in the trust per common share.
2. Medium case: I’m wrong and VYGG doesn’t merge with Reddit. They find a different business combination and the common shares trade up to between $12 and $20 per share pre-merger.
3. Best case: I’m right and VYGG merges with Reddit. VYGG/Reddit becomes a meme stock and millions of Reddit users buy in significantly pushing up its price. Reddit combines the hype-ability of being a technology and social media business and the stock goes parabolic. In this scenario the price range will be dependent on the original IPO price. If it IPOs at 8-10B I could see VYGG shareholders making multiples of their original investment in a *very* short period of time (less than two-three months).

**Valuation Model**

* Companies with similar user statistics have valuations in the tens of billions. Twitter - 61B, Pinterest - 50B, Snapchat - 98B.

Disclosure: I hold no position in VYGG or VYGG/WS. (My close family holds \~ 100k shares, 400k warrants).

2020-07-30 10:33:10,$FB - analysts don't seem overly concerned about ad boycott into Q2 print this afternoon,"**Raymond James:** *""We remain positive on FB shares ahead of 2Q results as we believe ad trends continue to steadily improve and expect stronger 2H20 results with an improving margin profile. While July has some headwinds including the ad boycott, we believe investors will largely look through potential July softness. We believe key focus areas for the quarter include: 1) July ad trends and impact of boycott; 2) impact of privacy and ad targeting headwinds including CCPA and IDFA; 3) expense outlook – we expect expense growth at low end of range for 2020; 4) Engagement trends which we believe remain strong. We maintain our Strong Buy rating as: 1) we continue to expect solid long-term revenue growth; 2) increasing monetization of newer platforms; 3) we believe expense guidance is likely conservative; 4) we believe valuation is attractive at \~24x our 2021E GAAP EPS (ex cash) vs. 15-20% LT EPS growth.""*

**BMO:** *"": We expect near-term trends to be among the strongest in our ad supported coverage universe and we continue to believe boycotts are relatively immaterial to near-term revenue (supported by our Ad Check calls). But we also think this is largely baked into expectations and remain at Market Perform largely due to a balance of opportunity (Shops, Marketplace, and other commerce initiatives; see our first take on Shops here) offset by risk (potential headwinds to targeting, safety and security spending driving down margins for “open” social media).""*

**RBC:** *""Based on intra-quarter data points, and our model sensitivity work, we view current Street June quarter estimates as reasonable and H2:20 estimates as reasonable to modestly conservative. Read thru from TWTR & SNAP is ambiguous to slightly cautious with neither company providing strong evidence of a V-Shaped recovery in Online advertising. However, both provided evidence that Direct Response advertising was performing better than Brand and neither cited benefits from migrations due to FB ad boycotts.""*

**Goldman:***""We model total 2Q20 revenue and GAAP EPS of $16.9bn (0% y/y, -5% q/q) and $1.40 versus FactSet consensus of $17.3bn (+3% y/y, -2% q/q) and $1.39, respectively. Our field checks, however, cite a strong recovery in ad spending growth in April and May which continued into June, as advertisers adjusted to the remote working/living environment and as such we see room for solid upside risk to results.""*

**Credit Suisse:** *""We preview Facebook’s 2Q20 results, which it will report on 29 July after market close. Our FX neutral ad revenue growth projections remain unchanged for 2Q20 and 2020, but we have decreased our CapEx projection for the year to \~$16 billion. We raise our price target to $305 from $258 as we roll over our valuation parameters to end-2021.

2021-02-23 05:48:35,"A ""Stocks for Inflation"" ETF and value factor discussion","I think that two Fidelity ETFs deserve more attention.  Each is under 5 years old with an ER of 0.29%, each had a regularly scheduled rebalance just a day ago (so it's a good time to evaluate holdings), and each makes novel contributions to the factor ETF space.

&#x200B;

1. **FCPI, Fidelity Stocks for Inflation ETF:** [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FCPI](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FCPI)

Methodology here: [https://research2.fidelity.com/pi/Content/Documents/RebalanceSchedulesPDFs/Fidelity%20Stocks%20For%20Inflation%20Factor%20Index%20Methodology.pdf](https://research2.fidelity.com/pi/Content/Documents/RebalanceSchedulesPDFs/Fidelity%20Stocks%20For%20Inflation%20Factor%20Index%20Methodology.pdf)

Described on page 5 of the methods doc, the ETF tracks an index that screens for value, quality, and momentum of stocks (a set of 11 total metrics, which I like for inflation protection due to the emphasis on free cash flow).  However, it also slightly biases sector weights (5% each) depending on historical correlation of sector performance with inflation.  So you get more weight on commodities-centric stocks, fewer tech and consumer discretionary stocks, etc (see page 7 of methods).  Its performance in the past year hasn't been amazing (it has been like VTV), but, inflation concerns did not really ramp up until very recently.  Also, the ETF index was reconstituted effective Monday, February 22 (see methods).  So if it's going to outperform a total market ETF, it's set up for it right now.  This is a small ETF by AUM and volume, so keep an eye on bid/ask spreads if you're dipping into it, but man, super appealing right now!

Having a look inside, you need to examine the daily holdings document since it was rebalanced more recently than the end-of-January summary holdings.  That's here: [http://fundresearch.fidelity.com/prospectus/eproredirect?clientId=Fidelity&applicationId=ETF&securityId=316092386&securityIdType=CUSIP&critical=N](http://fundresearch.fidelity.com/prospectus/eproredirect?clientId=Fidelity&applicationId=ETF&securityId=316092386&securityIdType=CUSIP&critical=N) .  Top 10 holdings currently include:

AAPL, MSFT, EQT, WMB, EXP, NEM, CC, PG, GOOGL, PM.  Thus, it's heavy on free-cash-flow tech, oil/gas, materials, and consumer staples.

&#x200B;

2. **FVAL, Fidelity Value Factor ETF**: [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL)

Methodology here: [https://research2.fidelity.com/pi/Content/Documents/RebalanceSchedulesPDFs/FMR\_US\_Value\_Focus\_Methodology\_publicFNL.pdf](https://research2.fidelity.com/pi/Content/Documents/RebalanceSchedulesPDFs/FMR_US_Value_Focus_Methodology_publicFNL.pdf)

Many ""value factor"" ETFs have a near-exclusive focus on price/book ratio and earnings (or sales) to price.  This one is different in that is specifically calls out free cash flow yield and earnings to enterprise value metrics, which are also metrics that DSTL (the ""Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF"", another modern value/quality ETF @ [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl)) weights highly.  In fact, these value metrics are also used as the ""value"" metrics for FCPI. FVAL is not a simple ""value or growth"" classifier like some S&P or CRSP value/growth factor ETFs.  It has consistently outperformed Vanguard's value ETF, VTV, probably as a result of using methods that can better reflect the effects of intangible value.  It was also rebalanced effective Monday, Feb. 22.  I think that this is the sort of ETF that may also outperform the market if meme growth tech stocks stagnate or there is mild inflation.

Its top holdings do include free-cash-flow tech starting with S&P 500 stalwarts AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL and FB.  Many ""value"" ETFs will not be holding those tech leaders!  But after that that, FVAL takes a bit of a turn; one thing you won't find in either FVAL or FCPI is Tesla.  But FVAL does have classic value stocks such as Berkshire Hathaway and JNJ in its top 10.

Microsoft however doesn’t seem to be named a lot. 

So I’m curious how people on this subreddit look at the company in the long-term. I’m quite bullish on them to be realizing the same amount of gains in the future as these other companies given the very solid foundations the company can rely on and they have the means to jump into any project they want.

2020-03-25 09:39:43,"$FB estimates finally coming down, 1H weakness a potential buying opportunity","Street estimates are finally beginning to come down with the company acknowledging yesterday that its ad business is weakening in countries where aggressive actions are being taken to fight COVID-19. Since US/Canada and Europe alone represented over 50% of last quarter's ad revenue, clearly the majority of the ad business is now under pressure.

FQ1 revenue growth estimates now range in the low-to-mid teens, down from low 20s prior to the pandemic. Use of WhatsApp and Messenger has more than doubled in countries hardest hit by the virus, but these are not properties that FB monetizes currently, although Instagram could be a source of potential upside with Instagram Live views also doubling. Regardless, the 10-15% decrease in ad spending from travel and films industries in Mar likely more than offset the usage increase across FB's apps.

COVID-19 is likely to get worse for FB since the economic impacts and advertising pressures in the US and Europe are months behind Asia. Also, since FB has no exposure to China, its Dec and Jan ad revenue trends do not represent a lead indicator for Mar and Apr. Since 50-80% of US TV ads are contractually agreed to in May of the previous year, large advertisers can't cut TV ads. FB's ads on the other hand are sold through real time auctions and are thus much more easy to cut.

All that said, a bigger pullback from weak 1H results could present a nice buying opportunity for the stock because the company's strong fundamentals are intact long-term. The FCF yield on F'21 estimates is now over 6% up from \~4.5% before the pandemic.",23,0.73

The indices reflected the tech dominance. The DJIA rose just 183 or 0.6% to 30,997, the S&P gained 1.9% to 3,841 but the tech heavy NASDAQ composite jumped 4.2% to 13,543, its biggest gain since the week ended Nov 6th.

The post-election rally of cyclical, value and small cap stocks was built on stimulus hopes and the reflation trade from the Blue sweep; it didn't see as much participation from big tech. When reality sank in that the massive stimulus bill was not going to be easily passed in the senate, the cyclical rally hit a pause -- suddenly tech was looking cheap, and NFLS’s earnings post market on Tuesday lit the fire. Interest rates too held steady – the 10 year closed around 1.10 and didn’t douse the fire.

**What lies ahead?** 

Next week is a very busy week with 20% of the S&P expected to report earnings. I do expect the tech rally to continue, though not at the same blistering pace; many will sell on news and take profits. I own all the FAAMNG’s and will sell small portions to book some profits. However, they remain a fairly large part of my portfolio and barring anti-trust government action, I don’t see any secular threats. 

I’m still bullish on cyclicals, value and small caps. I bought Toyota Motors, (TM), General Motors (GM) and Ford (F), besides increasing positions in US Foods (USFD) and Performance Group (PFGC). The autos deserve some of Tesla’s sunshine - sure they’re far behind in technology and branding but the gap is too wide and presents opportunity. I like USFD and PFGC, they’re food distributors and post vaccination and lifting of lockdowns – people will release their pent up demand for eating out.

2020-07-02 09:39:44,$FB - Goldman says partner checks indicate ad boycott has limited impact...for now,"Although a number of large brands have joined the ad boycott over the past week, Goldman's checks with FB's ad partners suggest a continuation of digital advertising strength seen in April and May, which Goldman expects will translate into a rebound in ad revenue growth.

However, those ad partners also see potential for further escalation if Facebook does not fully address its advertisers’ concerns. Goldman said they believe Facebook will improve upon its policies and their enforcement in the coming months which will likely lead to a return to ""the best-in-class digital advertising platform"".

The list of companies in the boycott so far includes Verizon, Patagonia, The North Face, REI, Starbucks, Levi Strauss, Pepsi, Unilever, Beam Suntory, Hershey’s, Honda, Clorox, Microsoft, Adidas, Ford and Arc’Teryx, among others. According to Pathmatics, Facebook’s top 10 advertisers have spent $570m on its platform through June 24 of this year, which is less than 2% of Goldman's 1H20 ad revenue.

But the big question is whether the boycott will persists for the majority of advertisers beyond the month of July, which is a relatively slower period for ad spend anyway. Perhaps an equally important question is whether the very large tail of direct-to-consumer advertisers on Facebook choose to take advantage of lower ad prices as a result of the boycott. Goldman estimate that every 1% decline in CPMs would result in a \~$220m (\~1%) decrease in 3Q20 revenue and \~$500m impact if this one quarter decline in CPMs persisted for the rest of the year.",0,0.5

* For Instagram alone, total mobile unique visitors -3% m/m, vs. -11% in April. Total daily minutes spent on Instagram -4% m/m vs. -8% m/m in April. Average daily minutes per user were -1% m/m in May, vs. +4% m/m in April, and increased 32% yoy.

Caveat: comScore implemented some enhancements and methodology changes that impact these metrics for January 2016, January 2017, October 2017, May 2018, and March 2019. Facebook’s own app updates have also impacted the data collected by comScore, most notably in October 2015 and February 2016.

While COVID has impacted F'20 revenue for the digital advertisers, Jefferies believe the structural shift to digital media (from traditional) should support multiple expansion and upward estimate revisions.

2021-02-02 08:13:25,Vy Global Growth (VYGG) - Reddit Merger,"Vy Global Growth/Reddit

**Linking everything together**

* Reddit last valued privately at 3B.
* Generally SPACs can do a merger with a company up to 10x the capital pool.
* VYGG raised 575M. This would likely give Reddit an IPO valuation of 6-8B.
* Alexander Tamas (AT) is an expert on social media/internet businesses.
* AT previously invested in FB, Twitter, Reddit, and Mail.ru. His VC fund, Vy Capital, owns some percentage of Reddit. Specific ownership stats not disclosed.
* Steve Huffman, Reddits Co-founder and CEO, is on the Vy Global Growth Board of Directors. He is not affiliated with any other SPAC.
* The VYGG prospectus specifically allows the Sponsors including Vy Capital to “self-deal” which allows them to bring one of the companies they have previously invested in public.
* AT has over 140M of his own dollars invested in VYGG common shares. This incentivizes him to only partner with a strong business that can truly grow over an extended period of time.
* Reddit is a founder-led social media technology company with 52M daily active users and 440M monthly active users. Exactly the kind of business laid out in the VYGG prospectus.
* If Reddit can successfully monetize that audience it could be worth hundreds of Billions someday.
* Steve Huffman’s goal is to offer every person an opportunity to join communities that they align with. He dislikes instagram/facebook and wants to enable people to interact with each other “authentically”.
* Reddit has recently posted job openings for roles to lead an IPO of the company.
* This means Reddit is ready to go public and now, because of VYGG, has an easy and fast way to get into the public market.
* It usually takes between 30 and 90 days from the SPACs letter of intent to the actual merger date, so this could happen over the next six months.

**What happens if I’m right and Reddit merges with VYGG?**

* Companies with similar user statistics have valuations in the tens of billions. Twitter - 41B, Pinterest - 43B, Snapchat - 83B.
* If reddit goes public for 6-8B then shareholders of VYGG could see a rapid revaluation up to 30-80B. That is between a 3 and 13x.
* Reddit has multiple communities of stock and options traders. Most notably [r/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBets/) (WSB) which has grown from 1.8M members at the start of January 2021 to 8M today.
* WSB has a mentality of doing crazy YOLOs using OTM call options. Recently some in the community have been taking out student loans, leveraging them, and putting the cash into weekly expiry 100%+ OTM call options on companies.
* I am bringing this up not because it's a good approach too investing, but to illustrate the mentality that goes along with these trading communities. Those 8M members represent billions of investable dollars that could be used to bid-up the price of their favorite social media platform, Reddit.
* This means there will likely be a “mania” if/when Reddit goes public.

**How each Member of the BOD fits into helping Reddit Grow**

* Alexander Tamas: VYGG Chairman - Social media and internet business expert.
* John Hering - VYGG CEO - Cyber security expert. Lots of experience scaling online platforms to millions of users. Strong aversion to the misuse of data. Fits with Reddits values.
* Hugo Barra - VYGG Board Member - Experience with expanding technology companies userbase internationally (Xiaomi). VP of VR at Facebook. Fits with social media narrative.
* Justin Kan - VYGG Board Member - Founder of Twitch.tv. Social media expert. Would be a useful Board Member for Reddit.

**Investment Case**

1. Worst case: I’m wrong and VYGG doesn’t merge with Reddit. They fail to find a decent business combination and the cash in the trust is returned to the shareholders. Currently it is expected that around $9.2 of cash is in the trust per common share so at my $10.20 cost basis I lose a dollar per share.
2. Medium case: I’m wrong and VYGG doesn’t merge with Reddit. They find a different business combination and the common shares trade up to between $12 and $20 per share where I sell pocketing a 17-90% return in under two years.
3. Best case: I’m right and VYGG merges with Reddit. The market is still very expensive due to mass hysteria and low interest rates. VYGG/Reddit becomes a meme stock and millions of Reddit users buy in significantly punching up its price. Reddit combines the hype-ability of being a technology and social media business and the stock goes parabolic. In this scenario the price range will be dependent on the original IPO price. If it IPOs at 6-8B I could see VYGG shareholders making multiples of their original investment in a *very* short period of time (less than two-three months).

Disclosure: I hold no position in VYGG or VYGG/WS.

2019-08-07 22:10:23,A comprehensive analysis on Facebook ($FB),"With all the recent controversy surrounding Facebook, today we are going to analyze Facebook's business fundamentals, growth potential, risks, valuation, and ultimately decide whether or not it makes sense to be a shareholder of the social media giant. Unless stated otherwise, all numbers and statistics presented below are as of August 7th, 2019.

###Social networking

With over 2.4 billion monthly active users across Facebook and Messenger platforms, and over 2.7 billion monthly active users across all Facebook-owned platforms (including Instagram and WhatsApp), Facebook is the undisputed leader in social networking. Towering over its competitors, the platform boasts more users than Twitter, Snapchat, Reddit, LinkedIn, and Pinterest combined. Despite facing fierce competition from Apple's iMessage in the private communication space, and Alphabet's YouTube in the video sharing space, no company has been able to replicate Facebook's success in the social networking arena, where it is unrivaled in both size and ubiquity. With over one-third of the world's population on the platform, the lack of feasible alternatives has allowed for an exceptionally loyal user base. In 2018, Facebook's reputation was tarnished when a series of privacy scandals exposed their mishandling of personal data. Policymakers were quick to denounce Facebook in the media, and public outrage gave rise to the global #DeleteFacebook movement. However, in the midst of all the scandals and negative headlines, the company saw continued growth in monthly active users. Facebook's market domination also gives them a significant competitive advantage when entering new spaces. When Instagram decided to implement ""Stories"", a feature that had existed on Snapchat for over five years at the time, Snapchat was quickly outcompeted. In less than one year, Instagram Stories had overtaken Snapchat Stories in active users. After two years, Instagram Stories had over twice as many users as Snapchat Stories, and Snapchat began to see a decline in users. Evidently, success begets success in the world of social media. This is known as the ""network effect"", a phenomenon in which the value of a platform increases with each additional user.

###Digital advertising

While Facebook is a social networking platform, it is actually in the business of digital advertising. It competes with the likes of Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Verizon in the digital advertising space, as well as everyone in the traditional advertising space, since money spent on traditional advertising is money not spent advertising on Facebook. Fortunately for Facebook, digital ad spend as a proportion of total ad spend in the United States is trending upwards. In fact, it is expected that digital advertising will account for over half of all ad spend in 2019, making it the first year that advertisers spend more on digital media than traditional media. It is not difficult to see why advertisers are moving from traditional media to digital media. Digital advertising often provides higher conversion rates and more impressions at lower costs, ultimately producing a higher return on ad spend for marketers. Facebook can provide more effective advertising because their ad targeting is laser-focused. Where traditional media can make their best guess that your ad will be shown to 18-24 year old females in New York who are interested in beauty products, Facebook can be relatively certain of it, based on information that users provide them directly, as well as data that is collected through users' activity both on and off the platform. They can also offer lower rates to advertisers due to the vast amount of ad inventory provided by their enormous user base. Additionally, digital media platforms typically provide better tools for ad campaign monitoring and analytics, which is important for marketers. With digital media, marketers can collect data in real-time and make changes and optimizations to their ad campaigns within minutes. This gives digital media an edge over traditional media, and Facebook is well-positioned to benefit from the inevitable shift from traditional to digital. Facebook currently sits at around 19% of total digital ad spend in the United States.

###Competitive advantage

Facebook's competitive advantage lies primarily in three areas: user base, data, and business success. As mentioned before, their vast user base creates a network effect that makes it extremely difficult to leave and tempts new users to join. Facebook has to spend relatively little to acquire new users in their established markets (which is most of the developed world), making them very difficult to compete against for new startups that have relatively high customer acquisition costs. Additionally, Facebook's data advantage allows them to create highly accurate and detailed profiles on their users, giving them a huge competitive edge over traditional media platforms and even other digital media platforms. Finally, despite being caught in political crosshairs, Facebook's vast profitability allows them to be relatively resilient in a hostile regulatory environment. Unlike Snapchat and many other tech startups that are not yet profitable and require constant capital injections from investors to sustain their operations, Facebook is a cash-generating machine. New legislation regarding privacy and security will likely be introduced in the near-future, and compliance often requires an increase in headcount as well as infrastructure modifications, which can cost significant amounts of capital. Therefore, smaller and less profitable institutions would be disproportionately affected by new regulations, assuming that the regulations are broad-reaching and do not single-out Facebook as the target.

###Facebook's financials

Facebook's financial statements are the kind that Wall Street dreams about. Their balance sheet is pristine, with almost $50 billion in cash and only $13 billion in current liabilities, resulting in a cash-ratio of 3.75. Less than 25% of their assets are funded by debt, so they should face relatively less pressure during an economic downturn. Over the past five years, their earnings have grown over 600%, and they are continuing to grow, albeit at a slower rate. In the past twelve months, average revenue per user has grown by 18%, while total users have grown by 8%, leading to a revenue growth of 28% year over year. However, expenses are also ramping up as Facebook faces regulatory pressure to make improvements to their privacy and security infrastructure. As a result, operating margins have fallen from 44% in the second quarter of 2018 to 39% in 2019, leading to a modest operating income growth of 13% after adjusting for the recent fine from the Federal Trade Commission. One would hope that Facebook can eventually reduce the costs required to improve their infrastructure, as well as overcome the regulatory obstacles as to avoid excessive fines and settlements in the near future. Ideally, they would be able to do this while maintaining strong revenue growth, which does not seem to be a problem at the moment. This is particularly astounding considering the already-gargantuan size of Facebook.

###Growth potential

Despite having over one-third of the world in its network, Facebook's user count continues to grow at high single digits, although most of this growth comes from regions where Facebook does not monetize quite as well, such as Asia-Pacific and ""Rest of World"". In these regions, the average revenue per user is less than one-tenth of that in the United States and Canada. However, this presents a macroeconomic growth opportunity for Facebook – as these countries grow their economies, consumers will spend more and advertisers will spend more to attract these consumers. Therefore, in addition to a steadily growing user count in these markets, with time, the value of each user in these markets should grow too.

More macroeconomic growth potential lies in the year over year expansion of the global advertising market. Total advertising spend worldwide grows around 5% each year, and as mentioned before, digital advertising is taking a larger and larger portion of that spend. As a market leader in the digital advertising space, Facebook is well-positioned to benefit from these two macroeconomic trends.

Aside from macroeconomic tailwinds, there are still many adjustments that Facebook can make to its platforms to improve their top-line. In fact, much of Facebook's growth limitations are self-imposed. Facebook is very conscious about the user experience and is aware of how it can be impacted by advertisements. Therefore, when rolling out new ad products such as Facebook Stories ads, they will likely take their time and exercise caution, often testing out the feature in small markets and expanding slowly until they are confident that it will not impede too much on the user experience. Surprisingly, there are still no ads on Instagram's Explore Feed. Additionally, Messenger and WhatsApp are barely monetized. Each of these present opportunities to increase ad inventory, but we can expect Facebook to be patient and to roll out new ad products on these platforms slowly over time.

Facebook is constantly releasing new products such as Libra, Facebook Marketplace, Facebook Dating, Facebook Watch and Instagram Checkout. If successful, such new products may meaningfully contribute to their top-line. Like Google, Facebook is also willing to make a few moonshot bets on new technology such as virtual reality headsets and augmented reality glasses. Only time will tell whether or not these investments will pay off.

###Risks

Currently, Facebook's biggest and most obvious risk lies in the current hostile political environment in which it operates, both in the United States and worldwide. The European Union has been constantly hammering on the tech giants for their privacy issues and anticompetitive behavior, implementing policies like GDPR and aggressively attacking them with fines, which, if continued, may have a materially negative impact on Facebook's profitability. Additionally, the United States government has also begun to take legal action against the tech giants, with bipartisan support. Facebook recently received a $5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission and is currently pending investigation from both the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission for potential anticompetitive behavior. The results of these investigations are to be seen, but any antitrust actions taken against Facebook could materially impact its operations.

Additionally, although the recent series of privacy and antitrust scandals have not seemed to meaningfully impact user count, it has seemed to negatively affect employee morale at Facebook. Surveys completed by employees at Facebook have not been as positive as in the past, and the company has seen ten of its top executives leave in 2018. If this trend continues, Facebook may find it difficult to attract and retain top talent and lose some of its competitive edge.

###Valuation

The following discounted future earnings model makes the following assumptions: Facebook's earnings will grow at 15% year over year for five years starting January 2019; it will have a price/earnings ratio of 16 at the end of this period; and the investor demands an 11% annualized return during this period. Discounting future earnings under these assumptions, Facebook's present value is $422 billion. It's current market capitalization is $550 billion, meaning that the stock is currently overvalued under these assumptions. However, any model is only as good as its inputs, and even a small change in expected earnings growth, terminal price/earnings ratio or discount rate could have a significant impact on the present value. Whether or not you should to invest in Facebook at these prices will depend on your own expected future value and required rate of return.

###Conclusion

Facebook is a remarkable business that has grown its revenue and earnings at an extraordinary rate over the last few years. There is still plenty of room to grow, but whether or not the growth materializes will depend on macroeconomic factors, regulatory outcomes and Facebook's ability to effectively execute on their vision. Facebook's fundamentals are strong, but with an adjusted price/earnings ratio of 24, and a price/book value of 6, it seems that this strength is already somewhat reflected in the market value of the stock.

2020-07-07 07:56:55,Couple of headwinds to look out for on FB,"Earnings are coming end of this month and there are two things that could lead to a major reduction in revenue:

- Advertiser boycotts, this is currently well known and publicized with a lot of big named brands participating for at least one day in July and many others doing so for the entire month

- Lesser known is that CCPA, California's privacy protection act will hinder advertisers to target CA's users in a major way https://marketingland.com/facebook-ccpa-compliance-challenges-limited-data-use-280308

> But the major immediate effect is on retargeting. When enabled, Facebook LDU will mean your business cannot include users in a behavioral (website pixel-based) retargeting campaign. To make it clear: if 100% of your users are California residents, you will have 0 users in your audience pool when you have LDU enabled. Since Facebook has automatically enabled this between July 1 – 31, 2020, this is already happening right now. 

> The full impact of the limitations, of course, depends on how heavily a business’s market is skewed toward California residents. But it’s worth noting that we believe that similar limitations are likely to be passed nationwide in the near future, and more stringent regulations already apply to the EU under GDPR.

So even for those who are still advertising, not being able to do so in the largest state with the highest income users could prove to be very costly for advertisers which will certainly have an effect on FB's top line.",2,0.67
2020-12-21 04:10:51,Comparing YHOO AND TSLA,"Hi all

So now that TSLA is in the S&P let’s compare 

YHOO(1999) was part of the dotcom bubble, a bubble fuelled by the (in hindsight) mostly accurate assumptions that (a) cost of internet is going down (b) user count is going up (c) margins for profit are extremely good (d) economy of scale on the net is infinite. This lead to the assumption that YHOO and its ilk could potentially have a user base of [the world] and hence reap profits from 7bn users for essentially no cost of revenue. (900 PE valuation)

TSLA(2020) is part of the EV/disruptive tech bubble, a bubble fuelled by the speculation that growth of these disruptive industries can in some unspecified way achieve global dominance over existing market leader under the changing climate of (e)environmental policy, (f)government attitudes, and (g)exponential technical development. Unfortunately unlike YHOO it has a high base cost of revenue (manufacturing, research, retooling) and may run into the diseconomies of scale barrier that stymied the growth of many other physical goods companies due to a inherently high retail value of goods sold being a barrier to entry for new users. Arguably its one standout feature is (h)vertical integration something that has historically been successful during the early 1900s seen most prominently in the Trust monopolies (1300PE)

While YHOO and it’s Ilk fell precipitously other new companies that survived the tech bubble collapse (GOOGL, AMZN, FB, MSFT, AAPL, BABA) actually achieved the stated goal of (a-d) and became the largest market leaders seen since The AT&T and early 19th century Trust monopolies.

Are we looking at the next wave of companies coming into existence meeting the e-h criteria that will take over the world? Or is TSLA another canary set to die in the coal mine without any impact.

Discuss!

2019-10-02 04:35:21,How likely is it that FB will actually be broken up?,"It looks like that's the line a lot of the Democratic candidates are going with right now and the more I think about it, the less sense it makes to me. 

Facebook basically owns three apps/websites: Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp. While these three are dominant in the social media space, it's not like they're the only options. You still have Twitter, Snapchat, Reddit etc who do pretty decent numbers and it's not like having a Facebook or IG page prohibits you from having those other social media accounts. So right there I don't see how Facebook is stifling competition.

The argument I've heard is that FB needs to be broken up because something like 80% of all online marketing dollars go to either them or Google. I was hoping someone could expand more on this and why that would fall under the purview of antitrust. The way I see it, Facebook isn't buying out competitors or using shady practices to make sure no other businesses are viable, it's just that they're the best at what they do so marketers naturally go to them. The only time that they bought a competitor outright is with Instagram and I'd argue that a lot of why IG is even profitable is because of what FB did with it after acquisition.

It seems to me that what people like Elizabeth Warren really want to hit FB on is their carelessness with data, which I think is fair. But they're going this antitrust route which seems misguided. If she wants to position herself as a trust buster, Google or even Disney would be much better posterboys for that. Targeting Facebook makes no sense.",21,0.75
2021-01-09 06:24:34,The future of the big 5 US tech companies,"I read an article a while ago, that the big 5 tech companies GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, FB and AAPL fear regulations of data protection and security. They all gather big data and are exposed to regulations of the whole world through their global activities.

Europe already set the path for more regulations with GDPR and I believe it will extend. Companies will be forced to monitor and report more details to their activities and audits will cost them millions in administration.

The US, after the whole disaster going on with Trump, his followers and whatever other groups spreading misinformation, will for sure consider further regulations in the next 2 years.

I work in finance, and I see what administrative overhead regulations create. They make development expensive and slow. So I wonder if the big 5 will remain being longterm sure return investments or if this could be the beginning of a slow decline.

2020-12-29 04:15:25,Why I think Facebook is ridiculously undervalued,"Big fan of Peter lynch and the concept of uncomplicated investment strategies. Like Mr Lynch, I don't pay much attention to extra technical analysis.

So For me, when making big bulk (no yolo) investments, I only focus on a few things: 

* **Profitable?** (Yes , Margins? - Mid-HIGH %)
* **Debt?** (Preferably NO, or Yes, but with 2x cash to pay it off)
* **Competition?** (Yes, but market leader or top player) 
* **Growth ?** (Yes, more growth potential) 

To me, a company that fits this criteria will get into my portfolio and I'll adjust as i see fit on a YoY basis. 

This brings me to facebook. Currently trading at $277, I believe that the stock is far far far far undervalued. And below are my reasons why:   


* **Is Facebook profitable?** \- Yes, 2019 profits of $18.4billion on $70b revenue. We still have Q4 2020 to go and as of Q3 2020 Facebook generated around $21.5 billion in revenue up 22% year-on-year (beating estimates) 
* **Do they have debt?** ($277m as of 2019 with $55billion in cash)
* **Competition** (they own a couple in IG and Whatsapp, but you also have Twtr, Snap, TikTok - FB is still most profitable out of all of them, better balance sheet) 
* **Growth** (Room for IG commerce, still yet to monetise whatsapp, could start off in non western countries if they wanted to do it slowly) 

From a balance sheet perspective, this is a solid business bearing in mind that almost every business took a hit from Covid. Facebook is not a 1-product company.. and they shouldn't be seen as such. The core FB app isn't going to be the source of future growth per se. Think Oculus, think Whatsapp payments, and many more.. ultimately, Facebook has one thing that everyone values - **DATA** from older audiences on the core product, to younger audiences on **Whatsapp and IG.** 

# What is the major risk? 

# Regulatory split up.. I don't need to go into details here, but we all know that FB is under a lot of anti-trust scrutiny much like AT&T, Microsoft and Standard Oil experienced. 

Most people say that FB could be broken up.. and I say, this is more reason to **BUY.** 

Typically when a company is forced to split, it's existing shareholders will experience a split in shares across the various baby subsidiaries.. 

***Let's use AT&T for example:*** 

>On Jan. 1, 1984, more than 3 million AT&T shareholders were given new stock: For every 10 shares of Ma Bell they owned, they received one share in each of seven new regional phone companies, or “Baby Bells.”  
>  
>10yrs later in 1996, their investment had grown more than 600%. 100 shares in AT&T became 550 shares in 10 different companies. (source: [https://www.spokesman.com/stories/1996/may/25/att-rewards-steady-investors-shares-held-since/](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/1996/may/25/att-rewards-steady-investors-shares-held-since/)) 

All in All, most forced splits via regulation only served to make the companies stronger : Another example - Standard Oil led to Exxon, BP etc (good for existing shareholders) 

The bottomline is, Facebook is a wonderful business from a balance sheet perspective, and there is still room to grow.. the risks aren't as bad as they seem or different to any other business in the world and the only reason not to buy FB right now is probably your moral concerns of what they actually do. 

Looking forward to your thoughts.

2020-11-12 02:26:40,Goldman Sachs has just boosted its S&P Target. Here's why," 

The news that the COVID-19 vaccine from drugmaker Pfizer (PFE) and its partner  BioNTech  (BNTX) is 90% effective, according to  Bernstein Research  strategist  Inigo Fraser Jenkins , has sent stocks scurrying like ""tracks left in a cloud chamber from particles scattering in an accelerator.""

Goldman Sachs strategists, led by  David Kostin , say the vaccine is a more important development for the economy and markets than the prospective policies of a Biden presidency. ""The divisive  U.S.  presidential campaign was actually a backdrop to the main event: a public health crisis that has tragically claimed 240,000 lives in the  U.S.  since it began. However, within less than a year, a vaccine has been discovered,"" they say.

The Goldman team boosted its year-end price target on the S&P 500 to 3700 from 3600, which isn't so far away from Tuesday's closing level of 3545.53. Goldman is also targeting 4300 by the end of 2021 and 4600 by the end of 2022.

The strategists expect the Pfizer vaccine, and possibly others, will receive emergency use authorization by the end of January, and sufficient doses will be available for the  U.S.  population during the first half of 2021. They increased earnings estimates, mostly reflecting the better-than-expected results for the third quarter. They also are expecting better growth in the  U.S.  next year than the market does, at 5.3% versus the consensus forecast of 3.8%. A weakening  U.S.  dollar and slack in the labor market should support S&P 500 sales and margins, they add.

They are not too worried about the weight of the technology giants -- Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and  Google  owner Alphabet (GOOGL). The S&P 500 would rise 9% if the FAAMG stocks trade sideways and the remaining 495 stocks rise by the historical median 12-month rise of 12%. And the S&P 500 would rise 16% if the FAAMG stocks rise 5% and the remaining 495 climb 20%, which would represent an 80th percentile move based on historical distribution since 1990.

As for the debate about value or growth, the Goldman team likes both. For value stocks, the team noted that Monday was the largest single-day increase in the factor's history since 1980, while they say growth stocks should continue to benefit from weak trend economic growth and low interest rates.

""When thinking about the potential resolution of today's record valuation dispersion, investors often recall the unwind of the tech bubble, which was characterized by a two-year bear market and large negative absolute returns of the previous market leaders. More often than not, however, value rallies tend to occur in rising markets during which high valuation stocks also rise but are outpaced by the lowest valuation firms. This 'catch up' dynamic is what we expect will take place in coming months as a vaccine is approved and distributed,"" the strategists say.",37,0.78

Here's my thinking:

* GOOG has rock-solid fundamentals - excellent gross margins, has maintained \~15%+ YoY revenue growth even at their scale, and search is a steady business with many entrypoints across the Google ecosystem
* GOOG has bets across so many forward-looking industries that I think they will be able to diversify over time and don't have real risk of not continuing to innovate. There's of course the risk of anti-trust and privacy regulations, but that's been true for years now (although things do appear to be ratcheting up).
* It seems their stock hasn't mooned during covid because a meaningful share of search volume (and subsequently search revenue) comes from brick-and-mortar businesses (as opposed to someone like FB, whose ads biz is more of an ecommerce/direct-to-consumer play), which puts a drag on their revenue.

2021-02-04 17:26:40,Livent (LTHM) is a Great Play on EV," 

Livent is scheduled due to report 4Q earnings on February 20th.

**Investment Thesis**

Livent’s primary source of revenue is lithium, a key component for electric batteries. Livent is one of the five major suppliers of lithium worldwide and the only pure-play provider in North America. We view Livent as well positioned to leverage the global transition from internal combustion engines (ICE) to electric vehicles (EV), due to its significant technology expertise, global supply chain, and partnerships with OEMs, including Tesla. Hence, Livent’s premium valuation accurately reflects the company’s ability to gain share in a growing market driven by a favorable regulatory environment and an increasing sense of corporate responsibility.

**Key Catalysts:**

\- *Favorable regulatory environment will drive EV adoption.* China is the largest and fastest growing market for EVs, followed by Europe. China recently extended tax exemptions for EVs while Europe enacted the European Climate Law with the goal of making Europe climate neutral by 2050. We expect the Biden administration to pursue similar policies, albeit of a more incremental nature. Additionally, corporations are increasingly adopting energy efficient targets as part of a greater awareness of their social responsibility. We view the favorable regulatory environment as the primary catalyst for EV adoption and one that is largely sustainable regardless of political and social changes.

\- *Livent is well positioned to leverage the growing market for nickel-rich batteries.* Within the electric battery market, nickel-rich batteries are generally preferred for high performance EVs. Nickel-rich batteries require lithium hydroxide, which Livent produces through a two-stage chemical process. Livent estimates the market share for nickel-rich batteries should increase from about 25% today to 75% by the end of the decade.

\- *Recent demand uptick suggests pricing likely to recover.* Lithium pricing had been under pressure due to a supply glut heading into 2020 which the pandemic exacerbated by reducing demand. (Lithium pricing contracts are long-term although lithium carbonate pricing has declined more than 50% since the beginning of the pandemic.) Industry experts currently estimate lithium pricing needs to rise by roughly 10% to incentivize suppliers to expand capacity. We believe this scenario is likely to occur given some recent encouraging signs, including robust October sales of EVs in China and Europe.

\- *Scale and Argentina operations offer relative cost advantage.* Regardless of the trajectory of the pricing rebound, however, Livent has a relative cost advantage due to its brine-based Argentina mine, which is more cost efficient than spodumene mines [\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn1). Additionally, Livent is vertically integrated enabling it to capture value along every step of the supply chain. Longer-term, lithium suppliers are pursuing alternatives such as the potential to mine lithium from clay and recycling existing batteries to insulate margins from global disruptions. Although supply may eventually be impacted by new entrants such as Bolivia and India, there are significant political and logistical hurdles which will need to be overcome.

**Company Description**

Livent is a pure play lithium company headquartered in Philadelphia, PA. The company went public in 2018 as a spin-off from FMC Corporation. Livent extracts lithium from its plant in Argentina and then converts the metal into lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide, which are the critical components for electric batteries. Analysts forecast Livent to generate $400mn in revenue in 2021 and EBITDA margins in the high-teens.

Livent recently extended its supply agreement with Tesla through 2021. We expect this contract to be renewed past the current term. Livent also entered into a joint venture with private equity firm Pallinghurst Resources to buy Canada's lithium projects, which are spodumene based. Through the JV, New Nemaska Lithium, Livent will own 25% of the economics, which should provide economies of scale for its North American operations.

**Industry and Market Opportunity**

Lithium is an alkali metal found in natural substances such as rocks. Lithium is extremely light, a property which makes it ideal for storing energy. In its pure form, lithium actually has an energy density equivalent to gasoline although a typical EV car battery has a much lower density due to the additional inputs required such as casings and electrolyte fluid. In addition to Livent, there are four other global players of which Livent is one of only two providers in North America.

The lithium opportunity is primarily tied to growth in electric batteries although grid storage is emerging as a secondary use case. (Despite the attention paid to electric cars, electric buses are actually further along the adoption curve due to scale benefits.) Battery sales accounted for 65% of global lithium demand in 2019 and analysts are forecasting this percentage to continue to rise steadily. Given lithium is a commodity, the only limiting supply factor is a price high enough to warrant mining. A third party research firm, Fortune Business Insights, estimates that the global [lithium market](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=rnOqyS-E5qWpEUFLoMeh3w3gSgw-u8NK1t-DXVE8CZI_qSX_FG7DaFbNfwOY1GCj8-hZsRn-ezuSitWBnrb4WpkSApmUiWBUpkd_X_Ms4WGIMiFgBeI_XOUAv_u0vuyiAnFinChKftDQSSS8I1GZbg==) opportunity will reach $8.24 billion by the end of 2027, up from $4.1 billion in 2019 (9.2% CAGR) while demand is expected to increase almost tenfold over the next decade.

Deloitte and IHS Markit forecast EVs to account for approximately 30% of total passenger car and light duty vehicles by 2030.

**Financials and Valuation**

Approximately 80% of Livent’s revenue is generated from sales of battery-grade lithium hydroxide and butyllithium. Energy storage is the primary use case for Livent’s batteries, including rechargeable batteries for EVs, portable electronics and grid storage systems. Approximately 65% of Livent’s sales are from Asia, followed by North America (20%) and Europe (15%).

3Q review: Revenue improved sequentially as demand slowly returned although margins and Adjusted EPS missed consensus due to COVID-related costs. The company did not provide 4Q guidance although management noted volumes should continue to improve.

4Q and 2021 Outlook: Industry experts were originally forecasting a flattish year for global lithium demand but have since revised their 2020 estimates upward to reflect an uptick in EV sales late this year. Hence, we believe there is upside to 4Q consensus. For 2021, analysts are forecasting revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of $400 million and $75 million, respectively. Given the required capacity demands, Livent is not expected to be cash-flow positive for the foreseeable future.

[\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftnref1) It is generally more cost efficient to extract lithium brine than pegmatite due to logistics, topography, and climate.

Here is a list of the stocks I've sold that have gone up anywhere from 2x-10x. yes, every single one of these I got in quite low:

AMD, NVDA, BABA,TSLA (this one is killing me),SHOP (this one also is killing me, got in <$100), PTON, TWTR, FB,CRSP, AUPH

Ones that have up significantly since I sold (but not 2-10x from the purchase price): SQ, SBUX, NIKE, MU

I had my fair share of losers along the way, not like I was batting 1000. and not like I would've been a millionaire if I kept these, but my financial situation would be DRASTICALLY different than it is now. It really would've been a life-changing amount of money, for me, for my current situation. 

I know I am stupid, I know hindsight is 2020, I will not make these mistakes again. But it constantly torments me, I cannot stop thinking about it. Every time I open my portfolio I am disheartened at how much I could help my family, who very much needs help (and help myself) if not for these moves.

2018-07-19 11:21:23,Zuckerberg's sales of FB stock since 2016,"I kept seeing Facebook pop on lists of top insider sales week after week and got curious so I did some digging and I'm sharing here. This is just all of Zuckerberg's insider transactions (they were all sales) since the beginning of 2016. In reality, the dataset goes back to 2012, but he only had two sales before 2016 and it didn't make sense to squeeze the horizontal axis anymore for two data points. 

Anyway, I wanted to see if the privacy issues had anything to do with the dramatic increase in sales recently so I added some annotations of key dates, which I obtained from [this](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/a-brief-history-of-facebooks-privacy-hostility-ahead-of-zuckerbergs-testimony/) article. I have two charts:

1. [Number of shares Zuckerberg has sold](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR92E3KFA66LFXmNZE-609pgoJav1Y0m9K-FT5qJKT0JrJei55uUpPS89Id6BuWYNpTYdBFEvPnnS8A/pubchart?oid=1414172733&format=interactive) versus the price of $FB at the time

2. [Value of the shares Zuck has sold](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR92E3KFA66LFXmNZE-609pgoJav1Y0m9K-FT5qJKT0JrJei55uUpPS89Id6BuWYNpTYdBFEvPnnS8A/pubchart?oid=2001634303&format=interactive) versus the price of $FB at the time

Sorry for crappy looking charts, this is the best I could do with Google Sheets. Anyway, it gets the point across. Zuck has sold $4 bln worth of FB stock *this year*, and $6 bln over the last 2.5 years. The value of the stock that was sold is calculated based on the stock price at the time of the sale (e.g. this isn't what his stock would *currently be valued* if he still held it). 

Edit: the price chart looks weird because only the prices on the dates when sales actually took place are accurate. The prices on those days are just connected with straight lines. I could have used points instead but I thought this was easier to visualize.

Edit 2: no longer sharing the charts because I moved to a new Google account, I should have used something else. Sorry folks. Easy enough to recreate on your own though, I pulled all the insider sales data manually from Morningstar, took about 20 minutes.",81,0.83

But if you look at most other stocks, like **MSFT, GOOG, FB, DIS**, their movements are pretty humble. Even **S&P** is lower than what it was pre-covid.

**AMZN** jumped so much because it's actually expanding its business through their own delivery system (like you might've seen some prime-labelled vehicles parked on your street), and people increased their online buying habits while not going out, so its price grew a lot during this few months, which I believe is justified.

2018-07-26 21:09:39,An updated Facebook (FB) DCF Model,"Lots of FB posts last 24 hours, but hardly any real discussion; lots of anecdotes and emotional testimonies. 

Here is an updated [FB DCF](https://imgur.com/a/iuVBMRJ) and [PE model](https://imgur.com/a/X9SSiIg) I provided earlier this year ... Listened to the conference call twice, re-read the Q2 earnings slides and have updated every relevant item I can think of (and with, what i'd like to believe, a lean towards conservatism).  

One post recently suggested waiting until $140 to enter. Let's give some perspective to that price target ... using my model, the inputs that would lead to a $140 price would suggest -3.5% terminal growth and an 11.0% discount rate.  

Absolutely not even close to reality.  FB has a current WACC of 8.3%, and using a terminal growth rate of < 0.00% seems borderline mentally retarded given Zuck's history of purchasing growth (ie. IG purchase for $1B)

I have a $302 price target for 2022.  Given today's close, that is about 14-15% CAGR over the next 4 years.  Not going to make anyone filthy rich, but still a very likely setup to deliver alpha for years to come.  

Also, consider this:  FB earnings yield rose to 3.70% as of today's close (a company still growing somewhere between 20-30% YoY).  The US 10-year is hovering around 3.00% .... think about that for a few minutes and ask yourself what ""relative value"" means to you ",73,0.88

2020-10-07 08:35:34,$AAPL - Needham says House Report on Antitrust should not impact Apple,"Needham:

""Yesterday, the House subcommittee on Antitrust released a 450-page report outlining anticompetitive threats posed by AAPL, AMZN, FB and GOOGL. Our key take-aways from the 45 AAPL pages include: a) dozens of complaints about AAPL (out of the 20mm app developers and 1.8mm apps in AAPL's App Store), with zero positives about AAPL's value to consumers or lifeimproving innovations; b) underscores AAPL's strong shareholder value proposition and finds fault with widely used business practices such as bundling; and c) most complaints about AAPL are biz judgments (they charge too much, they pre-load their apps, etc), and not easily fixable through regulation. Finally, because AAPL's core asset is access to nearly 1B of the wealthiest consumers, we do not expect this report to materially impact valuation.""

""Relating to key issues raised by the House report about AAPL, regulatory experts at Technology Policy Institute (TPI) believe:

1. ""The key regulatory question is whether Apple uses the App Store to systematically foreclose competition or engage in unfair or deceptive practices using quality control as an excuse. This question cannot be answered by claims of a few developers, whose particular apps may have been technically deficient, failed to meet some security standard, or whose apps were unfortunately harmed by legitimate changes in the App Store. ""
2. ""Determining whether Apple behaved anti-competitively when it pre-loads its owned 40 apps will involve considerations such as the difficulty of downloading and installing replacements for AAPL's pre-loaded apps (ie, none), the level of integration of AAPL's owned apps with its operating system, and any negative effects on innovation inside AAPL's app ecosystem.""
3. ""Whether Apple’s app review policies are antitrust violations will hinge on how its policies affect the market and whether prosecutors can prove that the issues raised are not just disputes between large companies over how to distribute profits and protect user privacy/security. Not being able to pay for Netflix and Spotify within an app are not, by definition, harms. To prove harm, a plaintiff would have to demonstrate that their absence foreclosed access, thereby harming consumers.""

""In the next section of this report, we include the full ""Apple"" section (excluding footnotes) from pages 331 to 377 of the House report. The bold and underlined emphasis below is ours.""",32,0.78

2020-12-14 13:45:27,"Market Roundup for the week ended Dec 13th, 2020","**Here’s the market roundup for last week and the forecast for the week ahead.**

The S&P 500, SPX went sideways, moving up on stimulus and vaccine hopes and lower on higher Covid deaths and lockdowns, [a weak jobs report and rising unemployment claims](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-jobs-report-was-ugly-but-it-may-be-good-news-for-stocks-51607130127?refsec=up-and-down-wall-street). Opening at 3,699, it moved to a new record high of 3,702 but closed the week lower at 3,663 with a small drop of 36 points, [or about 1%.](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/$SPX/interactive-chart)

The Nasdaq composite, $NASX dropped 0.7%, in tandem, but saw more volatility; from 12,464 it moved to a new high of  12,583 on Tuesday before swinging to a big 2% drop on Wednesday, but recovered to 12,379 by Friday, off just 86 points or [0.7% for the week.](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/$NASX/interactive-chart)

# Reasons for the drop:

**Fatigue and profit taking**: For the $NASX, the drop was largely due to profit taking after a 6 day winning streak. The Nasdaq had been making new highs after the elections on an almost daily basis and the drop was not unexpected and If it were not for optimism of the skinny stimulus bill passing in the senate, I would have expected a larger drop.

**Lack of stimulus**: Not to belabor the obvious, Congress gave us another head fake. A skinny stimulus package of about $800Bn presented by a bi-partisan group of Democrats and Republicans seemed to have a strong possibility of passing the senate at the beginning of the week, petered out in the usual finger pointing between the two responsible parties.

**Sentiment Overshoot**: Post election the SPX had moved up almost 9%, in what I believe is a sentiment overshoot. Cash levels with fund managers are extremely low at 4%, a level last seem in 2007 and not seen since the great financial crash.

**Too much optimism** – an overbought market: Too many calls and not enough puts. I follow a fairly reliable contrarian indicator called the put/call open interest ratio.

The Put/Call open interest ratio came back to prominence and gained tremendous significance as an indicator in 2020 with the rise in option trading from the Robin Hood cohort.

The put/call open interest ratio looks at the open interest at the end of the day in the total number of put and call options outstanding for the indices, ETF’s and individual stocks. On a historical basis, the open interest ratio for stocks is usually below 1 – that is, traders usually buy more calls than puts. For example, the put/call ratio for Pfizer is 0.2, i.e., or for every put outstanding at the end of  a trading day, there are 4 calls. That’s normal and understandable; with the vaccine, everyone expects Pfizer to rise and who would short it?

This ratio had been flashing warning signals with readings of 0.37 on Dec 7th, 0.35 on Dec 3rd and 0.4 on [Dec 8th](https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/daily/?mkt=cone&dt=2020-12-08), meaning that there were 2.5 times more calls than puts. When the ratio is around 0.6 to 0.7 it’s around the mean but when it’s so low it works well a contrarian indicator. - As it did around Feb 23rd when the SPX peaked pre Covid at 3,386. That time as well, the ratio was just 0.38.  It again proved reliable during the week of  June 4th when the SPX had regained most of its COVID losses and had reached 3,232, after which it went into the summer swoon because of the explosion of cases in the Midwest and the imposition of lockdowns. On June 9th the SPX dropped 6%. Similarly, we saw another implosion in late August and early Sep, when the equity open interest ratio flashed  4 ratios of 0.37 to 0.42. At that time, the famous Japanese whale was allegedly playing with $50 Bn of options, most of them FAAMG calls! In a matter of 2 weeks in Sep the SPX lost 9.6% and the $NASX 11.8%. 

The total put call ratio is usually above 1, because it includes open interest of not just stocks , but also includes index and ETF options. And it’s not because there are more shorts than longs, it’s because more traders need to hedge their positions and buying an index, or an ETF put is one of the cheapest ways to do so. This too indicated an overbought market with data points of [0.65 to 0.68](https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/daily/?mkt=cone&dt=2020-12-08). The lowest this ratio had reached in 2020 was in the last week of February, around the pre-Covid peak.

# The Week Ahead

**Stimulus and Vaccine priced in**: Yes, the vaccine will help return us to a new normal, but we still have to navigate a holiday season of travel and social interaction which will make an already macabre season of 235,000 daily new cases and almost 3,000 deaths, worse in the next 3 weeks. I believe that the vaccine and the stimulus is priced in and getting to new highs from here is going to be much more difficult.

The IPO euphoria of Airbnb and Doordash shows a very speculative and overbought market.

Barron’s has a great story on why this is looking a lot like 1999, and one should read this article in its entirety to get what a sense of euphoria looked like. [“Maybe this time is different. Those words, supposedly the most dangerous to utter in the investing realm, came to mind amid the frenzied pops in the highly anticipated initial public offerings of the past week.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/from-airbnb-to-tesla-its-starting-to-feel-like-1999-all-over-again-51607700149?refsec=up-and-down-wall-street)”

I believe the market will remain rangebound in the next week, with the key catalyst being the stimulus or lack of. Since this clearly is in the hands of Congress, I would refrain from trading on any assumptions. However, I do believe the damage will be greater if we don’t get a decent stimulus and the upside limited if we do get one.

Having said that, I do agree with [Nomura’s McElligot](https://heisenbergreport.com/2020/12/10/hot-takes-galore-key-macro-thoughts-and-good-stuff-with-nomuras-mcelligott/), who’s been spot on with his market prognostications in 2020. He believes the long term trend is intact and dips should be bought.

As does Marko Kolanovic, Global head of JP Morgan’s Chase, equity strategy division and another brilliant market strategist. [You can read more about his note here.](https://heisenbergreport.com/2020/12/09/marko-kolanovic-delivers-2021-outlook-a-decline-in-volatility-creates-a-positive-feedback-loop/)

I always track the two indices separately. The tech laden, $NASX has already had a blistering run in 2020. The SPX,  which is composed of 500 stocks, with a much wider range of cyclical stocks has naturally lagged behind the $NASX due to COVID, and still faces significant headwinds even with a vaccine being distributed. So often in the past 6 months, traders have dumped FAANGS (FB, AAPL, AMZN,NFLX, GOOGL) in favor of the airlines and the banks in what is known as the cyclical reflation trade .

|Snapchat|2015A|2016E|2017E|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $60m | $250-350m | ~$1bn |

## GOOG

So what did Google look like in it's early years?

|Google|1999A|2000A|2001A|2002A|2003A|2004A|2005A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $0m | $19m | $86m | $440m | $1,466m|$3,189m | $6,139m|

The IPO was in August 2004. It was values at $23bn in the IPO.

## FB

Next let's look at Facebook, whose IPO was in May 2012 valuing the business at $81bn

|Facebook|2009A|2010A|2011A|2012A|2013A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $777m | $1,974m | $3,711m | $5,089m | $7,872m|

## Well?

Both Facebook and Google were profitable at the time of their IPOs and they had shown an acceleration in their revenue growth. This got them 5 to 10x next year's forecast revenue, and 7 to 16x current year's forecast revenue. 

For me the key is proof that the topline in accelerating. Google's top line accelerated every year until the great recession. Facebook's stopped immediately after the IPO, crashing the stock, until the topline started ramping again in 2013.

## A Rocket or Rock?

If Snapchat's sales follow this path, then a $25bn will be a steal. If not, it'll be another Twitter.

|Snapchat|2015A|2016E|2017E|2018E|2019E|2020E|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $60m | $300m | $1bn |$2bn |$3.5bn |$6bn |




## EDIT:

If you're curious on the stats for Twitter, it IPOed in Nov 2013. It's sales had been accelerating. The business was valued at $14bn, i.e. 10x the forecast year's sales.

|Twitter|2010A|2011A|2012A|2013A|2014A|2015A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $28m | $106m | $317m | $665m | $1,403m|$2,218m|

2020-10-23 14:59:11,"SNAP is the next big ""social media"" stock - here's why","- SNAP is no longer a social media company, it's important to think of them as a technology and media company, this will help you see the 5-10 year outlook on this company much more clearly

- 249M DAU's, up 18% YoY, SNAP is growing at an incredible rate for an app that many considered dead. Compare this to twitters 189M DAU's, SNAP is gaining popularity outside of North America (India is becoming a massive market)

- Unlike Twitter or FB, who have aging user-bases, SNAP's userbase is the next generation. Most users are either Gen-z's or Millenials. SNAP has the power to reach 90% of all 13-24 year olds in America.

- With a young user base, and $1 trillion in buying power, advertisers are very attracted to this platform, this is why we have seen average revenue per user consistently increase YoY.

- SNAP is heavily investing in original content. Celebs like Kevin Hart, Conor Mcgregor, Will Smith all make original content for the app. 70% of ALL Gen-z's in the USA were exposed to this content in Q3 alone (insane reach to younger generation)

- On average 30 app opens a day, 4 Billion Snaps created every day

- Augmented Reality: SNAP is leading AR tech, and advertisers are moving towards using AR in their ads, SNAP is the leader in interactive/AR ads. (Nike, Gucci, Sephora, MLB, etc)

- Creator Community: SNAP just introduced snapchat Minis to the platform, software developers can make mini apps that live inside of Snapchat - this will attract a lot of developers as it is a way for them to make money. (Headspace has already made a meditation mini-app for Snapchat. Zynga is already developing mini-games for snapchat)

Things to watch out for: 
- SNAP has had history of burning cash, things are looking better as EPS is climbing, so we are on the right track. Just be aware of this.

TLDR:

SNAP has the largest influence on the next generation of the world (Millenials & Gen-z), if you want to capitalize on this generation, then they are the company to look out for.

I don’t get how this stock trades at 70x sales. It just blew away earnings (100% rev yoy) and is again up huge. Stock has run from 300+ to 1100+ since March. 

But this platform is just a website builder with a shopping cart. Small merchants sign up for a monthly sub fee and use their website template to build their online store.

How is this different from wix or any other website builder? If Wordpress adds a shopping cart, it would compete against shop. An engineer could literally develop a competing platform in a week. 

So where’s the moat? What’s to stop Amzn from offering a similar service for free? FB has already launched a shop feature.

2018-09-26 01:10:38,Insta founders leaving FB is bad news: My opinion,"So I while back (in April) I wrote about $FB being a great bargain since the stock was beaten down and the engines of growth were still chugging along.

Now, with the departure of both the WhatsApp and Instagram founding team, I think the story has changed for the worse.

The core Facebook platform [isn't as young anymore](https://www.google.co.in/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/01/facebook-teens-leaving-instagram-snapchat-study-user-numbers). [Growth was slowling](https://www.recode.net/2018/7/25/17614426/facebook-fb-earnings-q2-2018-user-growth-troubles) imply because of the law of large numbers. After the whole Cambridge Analytical scandal, a [lot of people are gone.](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/06/did-cambridge-analytica-actually-change-facebook-users-behavior/562154/) So the core offering is fundamentally broken.

But the Zuckerberg's genius move was to acquire platforms with untapped potential for network effects. WhatsApp and Instagram are both thriving partly because their network keeps compounding and partly because people don't associate the brand with core-FB's rubbish.

The core team leaving because of differences signals that FB hasn't figured out a way to keep these brands insulated any longer. The only monetisation strategy is still advertising, leveraged on user data. Users aren't as ambivalent to this model as they used to be. 

So over time people will grow defensive and the platform will stop growing. Plus, Zuckerberg won't be able to acquire good platforms because young founders won't want to be associated with the FB culture or business model. 

Am I missing something? What are your thoughts?

FB is going to launch its own currency shortly. 

I think this means the stock is undervalued. I don't think the success of the currency is priced in to the current price (and I think there was a bit of an overreaction re the regulation news). Obviously no one can be certain if the currency will be successful but they have worked hard on this and brought in good people to work on it (e.g. former Instagram VP of product) - read the article for more info. 

I also think that FB takes a mature approach to product development, they rarely launch and then instantly kill if adoption is not off the charts on day one (e.g. Watch, Oculus, Portal). I expect this to be the case with the currency.

2020-07-07 14:06:02,Amazon Will Be The Next $2T Company – Why it’s Undervalued," Forget  the hype about Tesla, Amazon is undervalued and is the safest place to  park your money. I breakdown the reasons why below. Excuse the long  post, but I like helping people make $. TLDR at the end.

The  only way to look at Amazon's business is to separate it out into three  very large businesses, I will break down each and why I believe the  company as a whole is undervalued:

A/  Retail & Marketplace - this is the consumer facing portion of their  business where Amazon buys at wholesale and then sells to shoppers. The  latter (Marketplace), is the faster growing and more profitable  business unit, now accounting for over 55% of all orders. Sellers use  FBA and sell their products to shoppers directly where Amazon takes a  \~7%-\~15% fee depending on the category.

B/  AWS – fast growing cloud business operating at 26% gross margins with a  $50B run-rate growing 30% YoY (do you know how crazy it was typing that  out?)

C/ Amazon Media Group -  this includes their fast growing advertising business, Twitch, Amazon  Music, and Amazon Prime Video. This is the least-known portion of their  business, but is the fastest growing with highest margins.

**Retail & Marketplace**

There’s  not much to say here, other than Amazon does roughly \~$250B in sales  and growing 30% YoY on average here. For reference, Walmart does \~$500B.  Even if you gave the retail/marketplace portion of Amazon’s business a  conservative valuation of $500B (2x revenue), it’s a very large  business. Now, take into consideration how much they are emphasizing 3P  sellers and private label products, Amazon’s profitability metrics will  greatly improve in this business as it lowers its overhead so the  business in value will continue to grow. This also fails to mention  their breadth of their FBA business and how many sellers use the product  offering. If anyone has sold anything on Amazon or knows someone that  does, 99% of sellers use FBA because of how easy, convenient, and  cost-effective it is. With the tailwinds associated with COVID, this  business will likely surpass 30% YoY growth, which is just incredible  growth #s for a business this large. In comparison, Walmart is usually  <10% YoY growth when it comes to their revenue metrics.

My valuation of the business = \~$500B - $750B

**AWS**

AWS  is projected to do around $50B-$60B in sales for 2020. Latest public  analyst valuations peg it around \~$500B, which I believe is unfair. For  reference, MongoDB is trading at 20x revenue, Crowdstrike, DOCU,  Datadog, all SAAS/cloud providers are trading at 20x or even more!

Valuing  AWS as a standalone business for anything less than $500B would be  under-representing just how large and fast-growing this business is.  Growing at 30% YoY at a $50B run-rate is just unfathomable. If we were  looking at this at a 20x revenue multiple (which I believe it would be  valued at a 20x multiple if it was a standalone company), AWS would be  at a $1 trillion market cap alone. It's the de-facto choice for  start-ups, even as Azure continues to take customers away, AWS is the  leader for all new tech/start-up companies and will continue to see  massive tailwinds as the entire economy shifts to cloud-based offerings.  COVID has also accelerated this business as usage is undoubtedly up for  their core segment of customers, while customers that are most affected  (restaurants) are not really AWS-like customers.

My valuation of this business unit = $650B

**Amazon Media Group**

Advertising  – Many people don’t know much about this business, but you know the  products you click on while you’re shopping around on Amazon? It’s safe  to say a bunch of those products are paying Amazon significant dollars  on a PPC basis (pay-per-click) to surface higher in the search results.  This business generated $14 billion in revenue in 2019. Google, the  leader in advertising, is valued at 10x revenue, so this business alone  is probably worth close to $16B after 2020 alone. $FB did $73B in  revenue trailing 12 months, this would mean FB is about 4.5x the size of  Amazon's Advertising business ALONE. I just compared FB as a whole to  Amazon's ""side-business"" in Advertising.

Twitch  – this is a tough business to value, but Needham and others have pegged  it at \~$15 billion alone. It’s the clear leader in online streaming and  Microsoft recently shutdown Mixer (their Twitch competitor). The  possibilities here are endless, look for Amazon Advertising to plug in  their data capabilities to target viewers of live streaming events with  products soon. Twitch will soon be merged into the advertising ecosystem  to begin serving targeted ads to viewers. Think ad-supported streams  where there is some sort of revenue share back to the streamers. This  feeds into the ecosystem where content creators make more $ (won't  leave), advertisers get access to a valuable niche audience, and Amazon  reaps the benefits of high-value/profitable advertising at 65% gross  margins.

Prime Video – the most  surprising stat for Prime Video is that 20% of Prime members sign up  primarily for Amazon Prime Video. With over 150M subscribers, analysts  peg the value of Prime Video alone at $200b. Amazon has also entered the  OTT ad-supported streaming market with IMDB TV (ad-supported free  television). This is exclusive inventory that Amazon can offer to brands  to advertise on, and compete directly with ROKU, which is valued at 15X  revenue.

Lastly, Amazon Music has  30M subscribers. Apple has 60M, and Spotify 100M. Amazon Music (Who the  fuck uses it, is already half the size of Apple Music and about a 3rd  of Spotify...)

Because all the  businesses aren’t broken out, it’s tough valuing the entire Media Group  business, but it honestly could be in the range of anywhere b/w  $300B-$600B off the synergies and potential for expansion. Again, as a  standalone business, this suite of products would have public market  investors salivating over the growth potential.

**Hidden Value (Areas of Opportunity)**

I  went this entire DD without mentioning the huge competitive MOATs  around voice (Echo = the leader), as well as their entire  logistics/ground fulfillment network, Amazon GO stores, and their  venture in the medical health space. Because it's nearly impossible to  value these things as a whole, you can basically pencil w/e you want  here from a valuation perspective.

*Amazon Retail/Marketplace Business - $650B*

*AWS - $650B*

*Amazon Media Group - $400B*

*Hidden  Value - Go stores, Fulfillment Network, Self-driving, Echo (voice),  Whole Foods, Medical Venture with JP Morgan & Berkshire = $300B*

**Total = $2B**

TLDR:  Amazon is undervalued at a $1.6B market cap, and the stock will be up  to $3500 in the next year. Business units valued as stand-alone  companies would be valued way more, growth potential is endless, and  COVID has accelerated trends in favor of Amazon for the next 5 yrs.

Facebook  ([**FB**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/fb)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&ticker=FB) faces little risk from the antitrust lawsuit the Federal Trade Commission filed against the social media giant, several analysts said. 

Shares of the Menlo Park, Calif., social-media giant at last check were little changed at $277.88.

The FTC and most states [filed an antitrust lawsuit](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/facebook-slips-after-ftc-files-antitrust-lawsuit-to-breakup-tech-giant), charging that the company engaged in anticompetitive behavior to maintain a monopoly position in personal social networking.

KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Justin Patterson said he was struggling with ""why a breakup -- a process that could take years given technical complexities -- should take place.""

""Instead, we believe this will likely be resolved with another fine and additional scrutiny on future M&A,"" said Patterson, who rates the stock overweight with a $340 price target.

[The FTC alleges that Facebook](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization) undertook a years-long effort to maintain a monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions and actions that target potential and nascent rivals.

The commission is demanding that Facebook unwind the acquisitions of photo-focused network Instagram and messaging app Whatsapp. 

""We believe Facebook’s virtual ownership of the social graph, strong competitive moat, and focus on the user experience position it to become an enduring blue-chip company built for the long term,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth said.

Anmuth, who rates Facebook overweight with a $330 price target, said that ""Facebook is in rarefied air across the combination of scale, growth, and profitability, as the company’s massive reach and engagement continue to drive network effects, and its targeting abilities provide significant value to advertisers.""

Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said that while there is certainly merit to the FTC’s allegations that Facebook strengthened its competitive position” when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp, the firm is “skeptical that the FTC will prevail,” as it is difficult to see how Facebook “precluded competition.”

“We can only conclude that the FTC suit is intended to make headlines,” Pachter said, adding that he was skeptical ""that a federal court will compel a divestiture, and equally skeptical that a divided Congress will pass a law that forces such a result.”

Baird analysts said in a note that the complaint has some bark but “little bite.” 

“We do not see much in the way of ‘teeth’ in today’s FTC/states complaint about Facebook,” Baird said, adding that  there is “very little likelihood that punitive recommendations to split the company will occur.”",1,0.6

\- FB ecosystem

This is the stock that i believe is invested in the right places and has a path forward in the global market. I work as a React developer in fintech and I greatly enjoy their technology. The reason I stopped using snapchat was because I couldn't use it on low connection in Mexico, but Instagram worked marvelously. I use Whatsapp to stay in touch with my family in mexico and Facebook to stay in touch with my mom. There's something extremely powerful about that in my opinion.

They're conservative with their push and development of camera  and VR technology which is wise in my opinion give the many opportunities that exist in that space. They're pushing along with fintech in India, again with small business through Whatsapp. And they provide a suite of customer services for small business and entrepeneurs.

&#x200B;

\- Microsoft

I think they will have a great run during the cloud era of software development. Their acquiring of Github AND NPM goes to show how in touch they are with developer servicing.

&#x200B;

\- Paypal

Paypal has a marvelous history and is a battle tested pioneer in the fintech space. I see them repeating their previous successes by acquiring Honey. I work with Honey in the fintech space and now I'm understanding that Paypal has an auto coupon scraper on my Amazon purchases while my Visa ones don't. This is the forward thinking I love from Paypal despite not being as flashy as Square.

&#x200B;

\- Disney

Disney is quintessential american entertainment. I believe their deep roots in American culture and the entertainment industry will provide a solid bedrock for them for the generations to come.

&#x200B;

\- Waste Management

Sanitation and environmental, like internet connection technology, are about the same when it comes to market penetration. It is a scarcity. Sanitation is a critical part of any society's development and wellbeing. I think WM will be there to benefit from increased urbanization and industriousness from technology and wealth growth.

&#x200B;

\- Kansas City Southern

I'm Mexican and my family are avocado farmers. I believe in the future prospects of Mexico and its relationship with its neighbors. Mexico is a bustling nation and many youth are international students that carry degrees. This is a far cry from having military policing streets in rural neighborhoods decades ago. Kansas city southern is part of the supply chain that connects Mexico to main industrious Mexican states like Monterrey, Jalisco, and Michaocan. I like rail in this regard because it's a lot of weight in one operation of heavy materials. So Canadians that use Mexican mining will also benefit from this railroad.

\- Nintendo

I believe in the future of gaming as a market and if I were to take a shot at who would be the most stable, I would vote for Nintendo. Like Facebook, they approach the family unit and grow generationally. I love their curveball approach to gaming and I think that creativity, along with it's customers trust, will be something I can hold onto for a long time versus companies that have a history of developing games like Call of Duty or World of Warcraft. Nintendo can take different forms: in the living room, at sweaty tournaments, online, mobile, on your phone, on a TV, in the movies, etc.

&#x200B;

\- United Health or Cigna

This is only going to grow and wont change due to American politics for 8 years at a minimum.

\- Cisco

Same as Microsoft but for IT.

\- Impossible Foods IPO

I've been vegetarian for 10 years and Impossible Burgers has been one of the most mindblowing experiences of my life. The product is phenomenal and on a league of its owned compared to Beyond Meat. IMHO Beyond taste like cheap school lunchroom burgers and Impossible tastes like something I would be excited to feed my family. If their pork products are great then I am ALL in because Chicken products are by far the easiest thing to replicate. I'm extremely excited about this product.

\- Visa

They make a ton of money on transactions. I saw them hiring for blockchain development so it leads me to believe that they're adapting.

\- Square

I work in the fintech space and I like their modest approach to financial services. Their acquiring of a bank charter is actually incredibly important due to all the procurement and legal processes that go behind being a fintech company (abiding by federal security laws, etc). The one reason I like Chase banking is because I enjoy their app. I see Square as a competitor to Chase, surprisingly.

\- Apple

Apple designs its products with customer service in mind. I think the future of education technology will likely go to Apple because of this. Their screens and cameras are wonderful and I can see them pioneering computer vision products because of this. They are THE American Tech company.

\- TMobile

Aggressive as hell and grew to be a large player through savvy moves across time. Their customer service is a highlight for me.

\- JPM

Customer service for banking is unmatched IMO. If any legacy banker will make it across changes, I believe Chase is doing what it takes to adapt and think forward.

\- Planet Fitness

$10 gyms, clean, and casual enough for the general population. You can't beat $10 gym membership when you're broke as fuck. I've been a heavy lifter before and still used Planet fitness in my transitions across states and whatnot. I need to look at their numbers more closely.

\- Volkwagen

I trust Europe and Japan to take EVs more seriously. I don't know who will seriously come close to competing with Tesla in the long run but they'll have to.

\- Panasonic

Panasonic, much like AMD, did not immediately reflect the value of what they have produced. AMD did not explode inline with bitcoin or cheaper GPU consumption, in the same way Panasonic did not reflect a massive spike in price after speculation in Tesla grew. They're an important arm to the EV market that spreads across many players ranging from Tesla to Toyota to big tech.

&#x200B;

\- Lyft

I think Lyft's focus on customer service and regional clientele will pay off against Uber, who is growing too quickly and spreading thin. Lyft will benefit from the development of computer vision and Big tech's interest in automanufacturing.

&#x200B;

\- Crypto (Bitcoin or XRP)

I like crypto as a technology as a software engineer. I see the value in a faster process for procuring and exchanging legal tender that does not have to go through the bottleneck of the ACH process or through legal issues like the PATRIOT ACT or the Bank Secrecy Act. It still fundamentally respects those laws without the frustrations of banking service bottlenecks.  I think the halvening protocol has an interesting affect on Bitcoin and supply and the market that it's trying to generate.

2020-08-17 21:06:29,Analysis of Scion Asset Management 13-F Filing,"I am not one to typically follow or pay attention to the investing of those that consider themselves ""professionals"", but when it comes to the man, the myth, the legend, Dr. Michael Burry, I do. Recently, his fund, Scion Asset Management, filed it's 13-F Filing and there was some interesting information in it. (Bear in mind, some of these positions could be a few months old, however since I am focusing on the call options in his portfolio many of these positions would most likely be long-term and therefore would still be valid investments). Of note, Burry had 16 call positions which represented 71.19% of his portfolio. I would suspect that these are LEAP options (at least one year options) and not short-term call options, which clearly shows that he believes the economy has seen the worst of the coronavirus and is poised for a recovery. The reason I suspect Burry is invested in LEAP options is due to their tendency to be mispriced and cheaper than holding a higher priced stock like GOOG or BKNG long-term. They would offer far more upside than just holding the stock itself. We also know from history that Michael Burry is not a short-term investor and his ""Big Short"" positions, which were also derivatives, took over one year to profit. With that in mind here are the companies that made up the biggest positions in his call options:

GOOG (36% of his portfolio)

FB (7%)

BKNG (6%)

GS (5%)

WDC (4%)

Various other companies made up his other positions which primarily consisted of energy, retail, gaming (casino) and financial companies. All these companies are in sectors which are market laggards currently, but would increase dramatically with a market recovery, hence his use of call options. From looking at his portfolio, it is evident Michael Burry is bullish on the market and believes that it is set to recover. He is clearly betting on higher interest rates in the future (financial stocks), higher energy prices (energy stocks), higher consumer spending (retail stocks), increased discretionary spending (casino/gaming/travel stocks), and overall increase in the dominant tech stocks (FB/GOOG). I think this is a solid portfolio and thesis. I am not one to argue with the legend and I will be following his lead into some of the stocks he has bought.

Any  suggestions? Do I take my gains and go out further if I think earnings are going to hit or stay put till earnings come out? Obviously if the stock isn't at 197.5 these calls are worthless by Friday, correct? (Im self taught at trading options so bear with me.

They are looking for ways to do it for years now, without success.  Their Libra project was meant to become their payments vertical but failed so far. It's still too early to judge if Oculus VR sets will really take off. Compared even to Google (I’ve posted earlier about their plans to offer credit to business in India), FB is in the very beginning of this diversification process.

2018-11-19 11:33:13,Should I sell FB to Buy AMZN,"I have very un-diversified portfolio with FB as primary holding. I have had good gain and still up from my cost bases. With really great engineers/talent working at FB and management, I feel FB will be back to its previous high in next 2-3 years. At the pace they are buying office-space in Austin/Seattle/Bay Area/London, I feel they are still in growth mode and have potential to grow specially with Instagram and WhatsApp. 

With lot of negativity in media, I'm worried about having all eggs in single basket. One option I have is to sell some and put in VTSMX. I will do good in long run 10-15 years, but feel like it may not be the best option.

2020-09-11 12:49:28,Investing when you don't trust [that] your own judgement [lines up with popular trends],"At 37, better a little late then never, I finally understand I need to invest my money.  I've read advice that ""if you have expertise in a field, why not use that to inform what companies you invest in?""

Here's the problem:  as a tech geek / early adopter I tend to get the technical fundamentals right, but bet on the wrong horse every time.  I zig just before the general population zags.  I know this about myself, so it makes me question how I could trust myself to pick investments.

For example, I invested a lot of time, and some of my money, on a *pre-Android* Linux phone and learning how to develop for it.  A few months later, the first iPhone came out.  Right idea, wrong timing - I missed the mobile app developer bandwagon by being *too early.*  Of course I could have pivoted to the new platform, but rode the sinking ship instead.  Plus my tightwad (now ex-)wife at the time wouldn't stand for me putting $$$ on a different smartphone so soon after ""wasting"" $$$ on a dud.

In 2010 I thought Facebook was crazy to turn down a $24B offer from Microsoft.  I predicted that people my age and younger would soon become disillusioned with the platform and might start leaving it in droves.  I predicted FB would become and remain an irrelevant cesspool of sh!tposts and political memes.  Plus you know, privacy concerns and all that.  Well you all know how that turned out both in what did happen and how little long term effect it has had on FB's market value.

In 2009 (post crash) I supported / encouraged my (now ex-)wife at the time in buying our first house, because I envisioned that entities able to buy up properties for cash, such as (foreign) investment firms and rental companies were going to soon start out-competing individuals for houses on the market.  I think I thought the concerning half of every trend over 2010-2020 was going to take place in 2009-2011.  That didn't happen (then), and when we wanted to move the house failed to sell; she still lives in it.

I was aware of Bitcoin from early on.  I could have easily mined it when it was still energy efficient to do so on a PC (and I had a collection of powerful PCs for the time), but I thought it was foolishness and didn't want any part of it.

It's like that episode of King of the Hill where Peggy figures out that by following Bill around as he shops and seeing what he buys she can know what to invest in because Bill is such an ""everyman.""  Except in my case maybe you should pass on the things I pick for myself.",7,0.64

2020-08-31 14:09:52,When will the market crash? Asking for a friend...,"Serious, I'd like to hear from you what you think is the marker of a market wide correction... or a crash to come.   Personally, I really thought the AAPL TSLA stock split was it.  I expected a correction across most of NASDAQ today.   The valuation run up after the split-announcement and before the actual split (today) was incredible... and IMHO... unwarranted.  I predicted (incorrectly) that profiteers were looking to sell off after the split and there could be a considerable sell off today.  I thought the fact that today was the last day of the month might be a catalyst of a sell off.  Perhaps ETF and Mutual Fund adjustments resulted in pulling AAPL and TSLA up, not down.  
I'm not a bear, or bearish.  I'm holding these because I felt they both have legs for the long run but the recent run up has me nervous and I believe large sectors are oversold (starting with FAANG, including all EVs).  


I'm a private investor.  A day trader (more of a week trader) of sorts.  I'm diversified.  I don't need advice on what to buy, or sell.  I'm more interested in discussing the next large swing of the market.  
Looking forward, unemployment is up but hasn't taken hold of the markets yet.  Unemployment benefits were chopped in half.   15MM+ renters are behind in rent.  Consumer spending is at an all time low.  I know I know the stocks going up don't depend (directly) on consumer spending but where does FAANG stop?  I predicted 10% above Feb 1, 2020 values was the ceiling.  We are well beyond that.  


I'll offer my prediction in exchange for yours.  I have no tacit data to support my thinking but here it is.  FAANG will get a correction somewhere along the line.  Not a crash.  Maybe a 10-15% drop from ATH.  That correction will stop this bull run and with everyone declaring tech as 'oversold' FAANG et all will hang at a stagnant value into perpetuity.   I offer MSFT from 2001 to 2012 as an example.   After the tech-crash of 2001, MSFT was 'stuck' at $35 for over 10 years.   10 years of steady improvements in customer base, product diversity, and increasing revenues but investors couldn't seem to care.  


Retail investors (who all suffer from ADD) will flock to other sectors while waiting for the next tech-bull-run to start.  It will be hard to start if MSFT, AAPL, GOOG can't sustain growth of cloud and retail sales.  But the customers (business and private customers) who buy these products will cool off as they themselves struggle with reduced revenues (see consumer spending).  It's election time and FB and others are enjoying increased ad revenue that will vaporize in Nov.  


But when?  Man... I don't know.  Assuming this run is caused by retail investors, perhaps the harbinger will be the fund managers who declare 'enough' and boldly exit.  Maybe when BRK.A sells all it's MSFT or maybe when ARK divests from TSLA or ??",0,0.48

2018-07-28 05:11:20,"If you thought the FB drop was bad, wait until everybody learns about what's been going on with Salesforce","Let's forget for a minute that going into this, $CRM was already the most atrociously overvalued company in the market. Who or whatever has pumped $10 Billion of fake value into this company over the last month or two is obviously insane.  GAAP earnings are being swept under the rug, and the accounting people are making up EPS numbers as they go.  

There is no justification for this kind of market cap ($110 Billion now?) for a company that literally has no appreciable assets, no reason for its customers to not switch to cheaper or better alternatives.  It should have flat to negative forecasting, not these baloney numbers it comes up with.  Whoever buys this stock as an investment obviously has NO EXPERIENCE WITH SOFTWARE.  Anybody who has worked in the industry knows: the more software you add to software, the bulkier and more complex and expensive it gets to manage.  You're not paying for the ""software"" you're paying for the ""service"" of waiting in line to get service.  Anybody using CRM is literally paying that company to manage its own unwieldy complexity.  Customers are paying what is probably a 50X premium for something that doesn't deserve a 50X premium.

On the balance sheet, its intangible assets are something like 40+ billion? That is NOT COUNTING SHAREHOLDER EQUITY.  Remember the accounting equation?  

""Assets = Liabilites + Owners' Equity""

The assets piece is being manipulated and false information is being presented to shareholders.  EPS numbers touted are not GAAP compliant; instead they are reporting past revenue as current revenue (accounting tricks), and forecasting future revenue based on that already false premise.  

Also look at its short-term debt obligations, which are already ridiculous (90-something percent of its intangibles).  And yet, it somehow manages to get way below market-rate loans courtesy of JP Morgan so it can do ""acquisitions"" of companies and pay the founders of those companies worthless stock. The CEO and executive insiders then proceed to dump hundreds of millions of dollars in stock per week.

&#x200B;

 

U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren is drafting a bill that would call on  regulators to retroactively review about two decades of “mega mergers”  and ban such deals going forward.

Warren’s  staff recently circulated a proposal for sweeping anti-monopoly  legislation, which would deliver on a presidential campaign promise to  check the power of Big Tech and other industries. Although the Trump  administration is currently exploring their own antitrust probes, the  proposal is likely to face resistance from lawmakers.

 

According to a draft of the bill reviewed by Bloomberg, the proposal  would expand antitrust law beyond the so-called consumer welfare  standard, an approach that has driven antitrust policy since the 1970s.  Under the current framework, the federal government evaluates mergers  primarily based on potential harm to consumers through higher prices or  decreased quality. The new bill would direct the government to also  consider the impact on entrepreneurs, innovation, privacy and workers.

Warren’s bill, tentatively titled the Anti-Monopoly and  Competition Restoration Act, would also ban non-compete and no-poaching  agreements for workers and protect the rights of gig economy workers,  such as drivers for [Uber Technologies Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/UBER:US), to organize.

A draft of Warren’s bill was included in an email Monday from  Spencer Waller, the director of the Institute for Consumer Antitrust  Studies at Loyola University Chicago. Waller urged fellow academics to  sign a petition supporting it. He said Warren was working on the bill  with Representative David Cicilline, the most prominent voice on  antitrust issues in the House. Waller declined to comment on the email.

Representatives for Cicilline and Warren declined to comment. The existence of the bill and Warren’s support of it were [reported earlier](https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/129fbf) this week by the technology publication the Information.

In  Washington, there is some support across the political spectrum for  increased antitrust scrutiny of large technology companies. Warren  positioned herself as a leader on the issue this year while campaigning  on a plan to break up Big Tech. She has repeatedly called for unwinding [Facebook Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FB:US)’s acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram, along with Google’s purchase of YouTube and advertising platform DoubleClick.

  

It’s not clear when a bill would be introduced or whether it  would move forward in its current form. Cicilline has said he would not  introduce antitrust legislation until he concludes an antitrust  investigation for the House Judiciary Committee in early 2020.

 

Amy Klobuchar, a Senator from Minnesota who’s also vying for the  Democratic nomination, has pushed legislation covering similar ground.  Klobuchar plans to introduce additional antitrust legislation soon,  according to a person familiar with the matter who wasn’t authorized to  discuss the plans and asked not to be identified.

Any proposal would face significant hurdles to becoming law,  and Warren’s version could be particularly problematic because it  promotes the idea that antitrust enforcement is equivalent to being  against big business, said Barak Orbach, a law professor at the  University of Arizona who received a draft of the bill. “The way I read  it is that Elizabeth Warren is trying to make a political statement in  the course of her campaign,” Orbach said. “It’s likely to have negative  effects on antitrust enforcement, so I just don’t see the upside other  than for the campaign.”

The bill proposes a ban on mergers where one company has annual revenue of more $40 billion, or where both companies have sales exceeding $15 billion,  except under certain exceptions, such as when a company is in immediate  danger of insolvency. That would seemingly put a freeze on many  acquisitions for [Apple Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAPL:US), [Alphabet Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GOOGL:US), Facebook, [Microsoft Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MSFT:US) and dozens of other companies. The bill would also place new limitations on smaller mergers.

Chris  Sagers, a law professor at Cleveland State University, said the  proposal would serve as an effective check on corporate power. “I don’t  think you’ll have new antitrust policy until Congress says the courts  have incorrectly interpreted the statutes,” he said. “Someone has to do  what Elizabeth Warren is doing.”",1267,0.9

2020-02-24 20:48:01,Picking stocks based on personal consumption,"The other day someone mentioned to me that I was a bit frugal. That got me thinking about the relationship between my personal consumption and investment. I wondered whether it would be a good idea to invest in companies that I personally did business with. I figured that these companies would either have such a strong service/product or position in the market that a long-term investment would be justified. So I tested it. 

The first thing I had to do was determine the criteria which companies needed to meet to get a spot on my list. The following is what I decided upon:

* Purchases must be notable or recurring. Notable would be defined as single purchases exceeding $250. Recurring purchases would be purchases made at least once annually. *Edit: I am looking at my historical purchases from the period surrounding the beginning of the analysis, not current purchases*

* Companies will only be included on the list if I am able to associate their brand with their product or service. 

* Retailers will be included in cases where their brand is relevant to my patronage. 

* Companies must be public, Canadian or American(or indirectly available on either country's markets), and listed at the beginning of the modeled period.

After compiling a list of companies, I looked at the growth(or loss) they experienced over the last 5 years. In my model, I would invest approximately $1,000 into each of the listed companies, rounding to the nearest whole number to determine the number of shares purchased. For example, if I could buy 9.6 shares of $DIS with my $1,000 I would record an investment of 10 shares, while if I could buy 23.26 shares of $KO with my $1,000 I would record an investment of 23 shares.

**Observations** 

In both Canada and the United States, the stocks chosen based my consumption *crushed* the market indexes they were compared against. The American stocks saw >3x greater returns than the $SPY while the Canadian stocks saw >2x greater returns than the TSX. 

Only one chosen stock in each market saw a decrease in value over the modeled period. Across both markets, nine stocks more than doubled their value. A majority(56%) of chosen Canadian stocks outperformed the Canadian market over this period. A majority(58%) of chosen American stocks outperformed the American market over this period.

**Guesses**

If I had to guess, I would attribute the success of the chosen stocks to any combination of the following:

* Dominant position in their respective industry.

* Offering an essential product or service.

* Providing an innovative product or service. 

* Positive or improving brand perception

2020-05-14 23:32:40,"I started my career in November and investing February 5th, 2020 - my strategy as a once peasant Mexican","## My history investing in college and my first month investing in February:

Learned about miners and blockchain validation with a chemical engineering friend before the rally.

- Bought **XRP** at $.15 and $.25, sold at $3.28 (I valued at $4 or $5 dollars MAX in 10 years if blockchain found adoption)

- Bought **AMD** after the rally at $11 because it was ridiculous how much cost efficiency they had introduced to the market to poor people like me unlike **NVIDIA** products which always seemed far removed and discouraged me.

- I started with **Panasonic** because I had missed out on the window to invest in **Tesla** at 200-300 range. I believed **Panasonic** to be similar to **AMD's** relationship to **bitcoin**; while all eyes looked at the shiny object, I looked at the boring parts that built it.

- The market crashed, so I DCA'd aggressively and controlled my emotions through out. I was more concerned with my performance to commitment rather than my returns at the time. I did well.

- My investments in March 19 was **SQ** and **Lyft**

## My Strategy now that I have income

- I bought up to 5,000 dollars in stocks ranging from **FANUC** (industrial robotics) to **DENNYS** (logistics/real estate)

- I trimmed down to $2,300 but will rapidly rebuild with a different approach:

- I'm buying 1 stock in the company before making any further developments with. Following this, I will purchase ETFs in sectors that I **want** to see develop in the next 5-15 years. I will buy 1 stake into these ETFs and combine it with my 1 stock purchase to create the necessary offset.

- For example, I bought 1 stock of **Texas Instruments**  for $109 followed by a purchase in **SOXX ETF** for semiconductors, which has the largest ETF allocation to **Texas Instruments.** I will apply similar logic to companies like **Facebook, Paypal,** etc.

&#x200B;

- I do this ""1 chip"" start in multiple industries because I want to pick some arbitrary point in time but I have a lot of industries & ecosystems that I would like to reasonably participate in. This will still cost a lot of money to start off with and buys me time to study company numbers and outlooks.

&#x200B;

## My current market sentiment

- I consider where you start on a graph as somewhat arbitrary and see the current market stability as somewhat of an exercise in game theory and rowing a boat throat a thick fog. I believe it's optimal to row cautiously forward and to not stay still. With cautious rowing, you'll be able to react appropriately if you are suddenly met by a waterfall or a path with clearer vision.


- I value customer service a lot. Back in 2011 I would have said that investing in Blizzard was a good idea simply because they brought their servers down for 8 hours every Tuesday for almost a decade. They did this to ensure higher quality server maitenance in an era where online gaming was unknown territory. If I were to pick an airline, this would be my center of focus. This often means I need to participate in the market in order to invest in it. This is why Netflix beat Blockbuster in the early game and why Disney may win in the late.


&#x200B;



- I am **\`*****BEARISH\`*** on Amazon in the long term. I believe that slowly, but surely, the market will consume Amazon's hold on its markets. I don't believe Amazon will maintain the status quo on cloud computing due to the quality of its competitors. I absolutely LOVE **Google Cloud Platform** and utilize **Firebase real-time database** very often. **Microsoft** has made some extremely important acquisitions recently in **Github and NPM**. I wonder often how rapid Amazon systems will become maintenance and legacy based systems of a previous era of cloud software utilization.

- I'm currently building an edtech platform where the system records students effort in various ways and translates that effort into a donation pool. Teachers are provided a platform to share resources and utilize analytics. This is all done in real time with Google and Facebooks frameworks for frontend and Backend development. 



-  I have suspicions about **Amazon** will struggle internationally. I don't know if Amazon will penetrate China the way China does, or if it will succeed in locations south of Mexico against things like **Mercado Libre**



- I have suspicions that tech platforms will soon integrate in a meaningful way with financials. As in, the virtualization of stores and forwarded payments in places like the **Facebook(Visa) Market Place, Twitter(Square) payment sending, Paypal(honey) & Amazon purchasing, Gaming credits, etc.**



- I am \`**bullish**\` on Facebook. Facebook is utterly invaluable and scales globally. The reason it's adopted in **Mexico**, for example, is because it's cheaper and faster than other services. They also service millions of developers with **React** and its growing development ecosystem. They provide a standardized marketting platform for small businesses on Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and soon to be JIO. I would not be surprised if they soon enter the fintech sector.



- I am \`**bullish\`** on **Paypal**. They are seemingly repeating their previous success by servicing large online commerce that are upgrading their systems. **Honey/Paypal** will scrape coupons for Amazon and force organizations like Visa to compete with  **real-time financial services**.



&#x200B;



- I am **\`bullish\`** on cloud software and networking. I think **CDNs** and dedicated **services for Cybersecurity** will maintain. Sure Google provides these services but things like **Cloudflare** and **Fastly** have dedicated solutions to fast image processing, DDoS protection, and more that other platforms may not be able to **allocate their resources to**. **Cloudflare** has an enormous network, and **Fastly** provides a great system for you to enjoy content like **Reddit.** I think it's hard to miss the mark here - the highway of the internet is going to get faster and more assets will be maintained in the server's space - the ecosystem must grow with it.

&#x200B;



- I am **EXTREMELY BEARISH** on Beyond Meat. I've been vegetarian for 10 years. IT'S BAD. WE HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO BE EXCITED ABOUT AND WE'RE NOT USED TO HAVING ATTENTION. VEGETARIANS ARE LYING IF THEY SAY IT'S AMAZING. ***IT'S LITERALLY DOG FOOD***

&#x200B;



- I am \`**BULLISH\`** on the long term development of **Mexico**. I think companies like **Kansas City Southern** that services **Mexican-American** relationships will grow well in the long run.



- I am **\`BULLISH\`**  on Apple and Adobe. Amazing products.

# Description

Not know what FB does? Where you been living? ;) Joking aside, here's how they describe themselves:

> Our mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected. Our top priority is to build useful and engaging products that enable people to connect and share through mobile devices and personal computers. We also help people discover and learn about what is going on in the world around them, enable people to share their opinions, ideas, photos and videos, and other activities with audiences ranging from their closest friends to the public at large, and stay connected everywhere by accessing our products, including:

> * **Facebook**. Facebook is a mobile application and website that enables people to connect, share, discover, and communicate with each other on mobile devices and personal computers. We had 1.04 billion daily active users (DAUs) on average in December 2015, an increase of 17% compared to December 2014. We had 934 million DAUs who accessed Facebook from a mobile device on average in December 2015, an increase of 25% compared to December 2014. There are a number of different ways to engage with people on Facebook, the most important of which is News Feed which displays an algorithmically-ranked series of stories and advertisements individualized for each person.
> * **Instagram**. Instagram is a mobile application that enables people to take photos or videos, customize them with filter effects, and share them with friends and followers in a photo feed or send them directly to friends.
> * **Messenger**. Messenger is a messaging application available for mobile and web on a variety of platforms and devices. Messenger enables people to reach others instantly and simply, and also enables businesses to engage with customers seamlessly and securely.
> * **WhatsApp**. WhatsApp Messenger is a fast, simple and reliable mobile messaging application that is used by people around the world and is available on a variety of mobile platforms.
> * **Oculus**. Our Oculus virtual reality technology and content platform power products that allow people to enter a completely immersive and interactive environment to play games, consume content, and connect with others.

> We generate substantially all of our revenue from selling advertising placements to marketers. Our ads let marketers reach people based on a variety of factors including age, gender, location, interests, and behaviors. Marketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including on Facebook, Instagram, and third-party applications and websites.

I'm not trying to be funny, but isn't it remarkable the position they give Oculus in their description. I wonder will be look back and smile... as shareholders?

## Recent financials 

It's a powerhouse! Sales expanded by $6bn in 2015 having expanded by $4bn in 2014. 

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $18bn | $12bn | $8bn | $5bn | $4bn|
|EPS | $1.29 | $1.10 | $0.60 | $0.01 | $0.46|

Now, when it comes to tech... I've spotted a trend, I think... that when the delta in sales accelerates, you know you've found a company that will dominate it's space. Go back and look at MSFT, AAPL (time of the iPod), and more recently NFLX.

And if you think the growth for FB is over, think again. The brokers are forecasting $27bn for 2016 (up $9bn) and $37bn for 2017.

## Competition

Their competition section doesn't mention names, other than Google.

> Our business is characterized by innovation, rapid change, and disruptive technologies. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including from companies that provide tools to facilitate communications and the sharing of information, companies that enable marketers to display advertising, and companies that provide development platforms for application developers. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain marketers, and to attract and retain developers to build compelling mobile and web applications that integrate with our products.

But the following list is pretty reasonable. I'd add in SnapChat if it was public. Though I doubt that ever happens. Zuck'll pay up first, I reckon.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Facebook Inc | $24,670M | 52% | 16%
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd | $16,628M | 36% | 24%
Amazon.com, Inc. | $127,993M | 9% | 14%
Alphabet Inc | $85,537M | 33% | 15%
Apple Inc. | $215,639M | 33% | 37%
Microsoft Corporation | $85,394M | 32% | 22%
Netflix, Inc. | $8,176M | 59% | 7%
Twitter Inc | $2,523M | 3% | -9%
Verizon Communications Inc. | $127,894M | 35% | 83%

They've got an beautiful margins, reasonable returns, with only Netflix looking peachier.

## Cash / Debt?

Today Zuckerberg has $26,140M of net cash at his disposal. That is the equivalent of 8% of the market value of Facebook Inc. So a little $35bn bid for Snapchat would be easy. Though I expect Evan will want to keep some shares if they can strike a deal.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $156.63 for Facebook Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 30% to their target.

# Valuation

So today's 30x would be 40x if the stock hit the price target? Now, I'd probably be worried, if it wasn't clear that they are going to be one of the few dominant tech franchises of our lifetime. And with their current sales of $25bn v Google's $85bn you can see plenty of room for growth. Okay, it's not as valuable a franchise as Google, yet! 

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/fb.o/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
FB.O | $348,166M | 30x | 35% | 0% | 3%
BABA.K | $233,390M | 29x | 27% | 0% | 4%
AMZN.O | $352,754M | 156x | 35% | 0% | 3%
GOOGL.O | $531,688M | 23x | 19% | 0% | 5%
AAPL.O | $574,770M | 12x | 9% | 2% | 12%
MSFT.O | $456,413M | 20x | 10% | 3% | 8%
NFLX.O | $49,532M | 288x | 65% | 0% | 9%
TWTR.K | $13,133M | 35x | 28% | 0% | 0%
VZ | $190,338M | 12x | 2% | 5% | 21%

Though *beware* when Wall Street says it's trading on 30x they are talking Adjusted EPS, not reported. in the 3rd quarter they reported EPS of 0.82 but Wall Street magically excluded employee stock-based compensation to come up with a $1.09 figure. So, the dilution doesn't count ????? Let's just *inflate* the figures by 30%, why don't we.

# Dividends

Facebook Inc is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. And why would it? Plenty of growth left in the young dog.

# Governance

There are A and B shares :(

> As of December 31, 2015, there were 2,293 million shares and 552 million shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, respectively, issued and outstanding.

Zuckerberg controls the business as he owns the majority of the B-Shares which have 10 votes, v 1 vote per A Share

I hate this sort of thing. The insane, I know better of many founders. Though I suppose in his case, and the Google boys, they deserve the benefit of the doubt.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -3% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 4%. On a 1 month view the stocks off 7% with earnings forecasts up 3%. Doesn't matter how you present it, some hot air escaped after the 3Q results, even though they beat forecasts.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers they pointed out

> We're pleased to see nearly 1.8 billion people now use Facebook every month and nearly 1.2 billion people use it every day.

Though they clearly spooked investors long-term with talk about slowing growth long term and 2017 being an investment year.

So, I'm convinced they are a dominant franchise...d'oh you say. And as much as I love to hate them... it's hard to argue against owning one at 30x if there really is a lot more growth to come. 

I don't see any signs of saturation. Do you?

And if you are worried about Snap, don't. I bet Zuckerberg knows he has to buy it. How else will he maintain his 100% dominance in social/photo-sharing. He'll pay the *danger* money and keep his monopoly. We'll thank him, I bet.

2016-10-05 11:02:30,Time to short FB yet? Buy 2 year at the money puts?,"I'm under the strong belief that Facebook is an unnecessary boondoggle.  In today's environment it serves next to no purpose.  This was not the case 7 years ago.  It was arguably not the case 2 years ago.

But now...  user growth is in the international sphere.  The active user base state side is dwindling.  Many people ""have an account"" but just don't use it nor do they really give a shit.

How can you expect long term growth prospects for a company that people really don't give a shit about?

Advertisers are still complaining about Facebook's efficacy.

I'm considering buying 2 year at the money puts.  Partial yolo speculation, but also because I think Twitter's woes spell the death knell for Facebook.  The world is changing and ""social media"" just isn't cool any more.  It's nothing like the hey-day when Facebook was limited to a few college campuses.  Gen Z will look back at it like Gen Y looks at ""Reality Bites"".  An anachronism.",12,0.71
2017-05-11 02:14:08,"The rule of 3... $SNAP, $FB etc","Anyone come across the ""Rule of Three"" profit warnings? 

> If a recent IPO warns on its first quarterly report, it will probably disappoint at the second and the third quarter.

Here's the example of [Facebook](https://stockflare.com/stock/fb.o):

* IPOed at $38 on 18th May 2012
* 2Q results on 31st July 2012, $29 before results, $23 after
* 3Q results on 24th Oct 2012, $20 before results, $22 after
* FY on 1st Feb 2013, $31 before results, $30 after

The logic is pretty simple:

1. an IPO is the moment of greatest disclosure of data. Management should be able to clearly articulate the first quarter figures to analysts, and be laser focused on meeting or beating them
2. if they can't even get the first quarter figures right, then there is little chance that the first year forecasts of the rosey-eyed brokers at the lead investment banks will be met
3. But profit warnings are a bitter pill, so not everyone sells at the first disappointment, some hold on, encouraged by the brokers at the lead investment banks
4. Typically, most of the hold-outs sell after the second profit warning
5. And the final shoe, the rosey-recommendations and forecasts of the brokers at the lead investment banks, rarely falls until the third quarter, when even the die-hard supporters exit.

Often there's a buying opportunity them :) 

So [$SNAP](https://stockflare.com/stock/snap.k) see you in 6 months.

2020-08-23 06:49:04,"Facebook could lose money on its Virtual Reality investment with Oculus, and it'd still be worth it.","Facebook recently announced its [Oculus VR headset will require a FB login](https://www.oculus.com/blog/a-single-way-to-log-into-oculus-and-unlock-social-features/)

Facebook as exists today is essentially a portfolio of social media apps. Social media apps indirectly compete with anything that you spend your attention on, but they of course compete directly with other social media apps.

Today, Tik Tok, YouTube, Twitter, Discord, Snapchat, iMessage, etc can be counted as direct threats to Facebook. There's also a very low barrier to entry to grab niche in the social media space, meaning that there's constantly the threat of new competitors.

**If Facebook is successful with Oculus while FB login mandated, it turns FB into a platform without the worries of other social media apps.** If they can reach 1 billion Oculus headsets sold, and FB login for each, there is no chance of social-media-only company replacing that utility

Investors ask will Facebook still be dominant in the social media space 10 years from now. The answer is probably, but if FB's hardware division has any success with Oculus (or any other hardware effort) it certainly will. Facebook could lose money on the Oculus investment, and it'd still be worth it to add an inescapable utility for the platform.  They also don't have to reach 1 billion sold (Zuck's goal), each person that finds ongoing utility through an Oculus headset with mandated FB login strengthens the longevity of FB.

VR is currently the best bet Facebook has to achieve that dream, but I think there is also a chance that   consumer AR will develop into a possible duopoly/oligopoly. Facebook undoubtedly has additional goals for VR/AR, but Facebook already has a quickly growing 700 billion dollar business that it can solidify by becoming the next computing platform. I think everything else is a plus, that doesn't mean that it isn't important.

--- If FB reaches 1 billion headsets sold it won't be because of gaming it'll be because of remote work, being a great display, and telepresence. Today VR's main use is gaming but it won't be 10 years from now",0,0.36

If I checked at 3:58PM, would I have been fooled to see that it was $217? Surely people were selling throughout the day, depending on when the earnings report came out?

Actually, another question about that. Is it like registering for classes at school where people race to read it the second it comes out to make decisions?

2013-10-28 07:12:26,I am going big on FB stock..Inside I'll explain why. Looking for some opinions.,"Ok first off let me start out by saying that I am in no way an expert investor I am pretty much going with a gut feeling and I little bit of insight. I know Facebook is overvalued but I think this hype could really drive the stock price up.

A little about me: 
I am a very large affiliate marketer. My company spends more than $1,000,000 a month on Facebook ads in different niche markets. Within my group of peers (who have a similar strategy as us) we represent close to $7,000,000 a month in ad spend. 

One of the biggest factors in our type of business is statistics & projections. ie. Traffic Costs, measuring ROI and adjusting the funnel to maximize ROI. (much more goes into it but to keep it easy i'll stop there)

Over the last four months we have noticed several changes to the Facebook ads platform that I think will certainly contribute to Facebook's profits in their quarterly report.

#1. Ads Approval Process.
In July Ad approvals sometimes took up to 3 days before advertisers could start running your campaign. If I wanted to spend $10,000 a day on a specific campaign I would submit my ads and need to wait two days in order to do so. Facebook has streamlined the ad approval process this quarter. Ads normally get approved in under an hour. Spending happens within an hour or two of submitting ads. (this has been great for us, because we can quickly ramp up spend on ads that are converting well).

#2 Advertising On Facebook Is 3x More Expensive.
On all of our campaigns combined we are seeing a 200-300% increase in costs on Mobile & Desktop. On some of our more popular products we were used to seeing 300-500% ROI daily. It's like Facebook has priced their ads at a perfect 100% ROI for us. Not to cheap.. but not to expensive to where we would stop spending. The inventory is also much lower in most demographics. We are not getting as much newsfeed placement (the highest converting inventory)

#3 Facebook has streamlined the  Ad Creation process.
We used 3rd party tools for our campaigns so this part does not apply to us. Any average Joe who wants to promote their website/blog/local business can now do it quite easy with Facebooks new Ads Manager. I think this is going to help their quarterly profits. I have heard that Facebook has over 1,000,000 advertisers many of these are average Joe's.

#4 Facebook has added some great tools for bigger advertisers. 
The more advanced tools such as ""power editor"" for the larger agency sized marketers have been completely redone to help advertisers maximize profits and streamline ad creation. These changes + the approval process streamline has really helped advertisers and in return they are spending more.

Just to be clear.. all of the changes listed above have happened in this quarter. Advertising is Facebooks biggest revenue source and I am certainly one of their largest advertisers. I really think the changes they have made + inventory getting lower + prices getting higher will show massive growth this quarter. 

Facebook has also announced Instagram ads I am sure this news will be plastered into their projections which will help with the hype.

So I am buying $150k worth of Facebook stock between now and their quarterly report. I plan on selling shortly after. I know this is a  tunnel vision gamble.  I know there are many other factors in setting stock prices so looking for any opinions. Am I crazy? Are some of the factors I listed above useful? Any ideas? 

Ps sorry for any spelling or grammar mistakes. I don't have time to proof read. :)

I just don't see anyone competing with them, except each other.  For example if GOOGL falls it will be because of FB.  Or if AAPL falls it will be because of AMZN, ect.

So would it make sense to invest 10% of my portfolio in each of those names?  And then the other 50% in low fee ETFs ( USA, Bonds, and International).

2020-07-22 11:05:22,Which stock do you see to top market cap rank at 2029?,"Interesting note: 2010-2020 was a time of a huge shift in mindset of investors and landscale of large companies.[For biggest part of 20th century, stock market was dominated by the same names](https://www.researchaffiliates.com/documents/F_2010_April_Fifty_Years_of_RAFI.pdf): AT&T, Exxon, General Motors, IBM, General Electric. For 35 years from 1960 till 1995, these 4 companies rotate each other in TOP-3 list by market cap. 

In 2000s after dot com bubble, new names enters the list. We start seeing Microsoft, Walmart, Pfizer, Merk, big banks like Citigroup of Bank of America, while IBM drops off, but still Exxon and GE keeps their presence.

2010 list was [dominated by high oil prices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization): Exxon, PetroChina, Royal Dutch Shell, Petrobas. 

And in 2010s the dramatic of change was unprecedented. Just **in 10 years, 8 out of 10 top market cap companies drops from the list**. The only 2 who remain are Microsoft & Apple. Now list consists of 7 tech stocks (even 8, if we count Visa as a tech company due to the full IT dependence of its payment system), with only JNJ and BRK as non-tech left.

In the entire market history it was never the case like this. 10 years which changed absolutely everything on the market. 

Hence, the question: *do you think FAAGM will dominate the world in next decade too, or new names (TSLA? NVDA?) are coming to take to royal place soon?*

Personally, in my opinion, current tech area is not properly regulated by anti-monopoly law (especially Facebook, owning information flow of 2bln people, and fully managed by Zuk, who holds majority of shareholders vote), and I will not be surprised to see FB & Google to be divided into different companies like it was century ago with Carnegi & Rockfeller companies. Amazon with P/E close to 150 and extreme low marginality (part of their strategy to kill all competitors, so-called, Amazon effect) eithr should increase marginality soon, or investors might correct the price of the company. Apple will live till new revolution personal device enters the market (NeuraLink?) and only for Microsoft I don't see the way it might fail soon.",7,0.69

I think majority of the stock selections are pretty mainstream, picked to mimic QQQ. I personally added TSM and ASML as I’m a strong believer in semiconductors going forward.

What differentiates the portfolio above and QQQ is the weights itself. Instead of adjusting it based on market cap, I’ve decided to optimise the weights above with a sole focus - to maximise Sortino Ratio.

Backtested portfolio since Sept 2012 vs QQQ:
CAGR - 36.71% vs 20.06%
StDev - 16.97% vs 14.97%
Best Year - 57.78% vs 38.96%
Worst Year - 5.52% vs -3.63%
Sortino Ratio - 4.17 vs 2.28

By analysing the numbers above, it’s basically a less diverse portfolio with 11 holdings, higher StdDev but significantly higher returns, and a much more efficient fund. Even the worst year for it is still a positive return. 

Yes I’m aware that my findings are based on historical prices and it doesn’t guarantee future returns",2,0.57

2019-12-24 15:03:26,Year end to-do: Open a Fidelity Charitable account,"I had heard of donor advised funds before. And I knew there were tremendous tax benefits to donating appreciated stock to a charity. What I hadn't realized that these are tools available to regular investors and they taste great together. 

Every year, I donate several thousand dollars in cash to a variety of charities for a variety of reasons. Also almost every year, I sell well appreciated stock (hint 1998 $SAM, 2012 $FB) and pay taxes. Well, this year I stumbled on Fidelity Charitable, which is a donor advised fund. It's actually a charity itself, to which anyone can donate money. Nearly, or perhaps all, of their donations are made to donor-advised funds. Then people (like me) recommend grants to various charities. This all makes it sound hard. I'll simplify.

**I transfer $5000 in $FB (that I bought for $1000) to my Fidelity Charitable account. That's a $5000 deduction I can take this year. And no capital gains taxes at all.** Then, the assets remain in the account until I direct Fidelity to send a check to a 501(c)3 charity, which could be days or years later.

If instead I had sold stock then donated the money, I would owe taxes on $4000 of gains (about $1K). So my recommendation is for anyone that has appreciated stock they want to sell and charities to which they regularly contribute, open a Fidelity Charitable account (donor advised fund). Minimum opening contribution is $5000, after that I think any amount is OK. Because of the ability to donate appreciated assets and the charitable deduction, each 100 dollars I donate only costs me 50 dollars out of my pocket, making it easier to be more generous. 

Still time to make a big contribution for 2019 and get the tax benefit in a few short months. And avoid capital gains taxes at the same time. Wish I learned about this 5 years ago. FYI there are other funds that do the same, Fidelity happens to have a low minimum contribution and is where I keep my money already.",584,0.93
2020-01-16 10:42:56,"My revised (again) model of TSLA through 2028 (Price Target of $17,600 in 2028)","Hi gang,

I posed two different models in the last 6 years that I'm continually revisiting and updating based on new data that's available to me.

Here's the first one below from 6 years ago where I attached a $450 price target by end of 2018
https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1k15cb/my_model_of_tsla_through_2013/?st=k5h2987i&sh=78a9694b

Here's the second one I posted a year later with a price target of $800 by end of 2020
https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1yn1kx/my_revised_model_of_tesla_tsla_by_2023/?st=k5h26rti&sh=43f78d64

It appears that my models are running roughly a year behind of where my assumptions are ending up, so I figured I'd share my latest model for your viewing and entertainment pleasure.

In no way am I trying to insinuate that my models are somehow predicting where Tesla's price is going to end up - I'm simply sharing my thought process with you fine folks in the investing community to gather feedback and understand different points of view.

See below model:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUPfQhpFfax8lYC4iyvYT-gD_i9LIRkngFB_o6MZXA8/edit?usp=sharing

My broad assumptions:

* There will be a 90,000,000 global new vehicle market in 2028
* Roughly 50% of those sales will be electric
* Tesla will capture 17% of the EV market which is roughly 7.6 million cars a year
* I'm assuming a new vehicle introduced in 2025 that will capture the truly affordable car market that will be designed in China and released for worldwide consumption (average of $20k per car without autonomous features). This is called Cybercar in the model
* Autonomous vehicle revenue will begin to kick in around the year 2025
* By 2028, roughly 33% of Tesla's new fleet sales (7.6 * .33 = 2.3m) will be generating some level of revenue for the company as autonomous revenue. For this model I'm assuming $7.3k of sales from autonomous per unit on average at 80% margin
* I'm assuming roughly 1% dilution YoY
* I'm assuming ~300k Tesla operated RoboTaxis manufactured yearly by Tesla to cover gaps in coverage in the self driving network
* I'm assuming Tesla Energy to grow to generate similar levels of sales from the Energy business by 2028 as compared to Auto
* i'm assuming a total operating income % of sales of 17.3% on $508b of revenue by 2028
* I'm assuming a 38 P/E multiple on $87b of yearly earnings by 2028

That covers all the big picture stuff as it pertains to what the model takes into account.

The price is obviously eye popping and would give Tesla a market cap of ~3.5 trillion. However, the way I think about this company is drawing a parallel to Apple, which is a Hardware company that has a SaaS (Software as a Service) component bolted on top of it selling units that generate vastly more $ per unit sold, and is entering an entirely disrupted market in the last 100 years that is about as large as it gets on the auto side - and then you add energy on top of it.

Let me know your thoughts.

Just not sure AAPL still has that edge they use to have and other companies are starting to catch up to them. YHOO is making great moves under Mayer. AMZN also has great leadership under Bezos and is a very innovative company as well.

Except for FB, Ive been watching all these. I dont know much about FB's acquisitions. Oculus VR, Instagram, WhatsApp, and the 50 some others over the past years... I know of them, but Im not much other than topical information. I dont like FB as an investment because I think it will dwindle in use a la MySpace, though I dont have anything to substantiate that.  

I like Amazon and Netflix because I use both frequently and want them to succeed. They both have big plans for expansion and seem like good investments at currently low prices. 

It seems like Apple is losing its share of the phone market and I personally feel like its products are overvalued, but many other people would likely disagree with that. (As I type this on my iPhone.)

Then the ubiquitous Google, the company so well known, their name has become a verb. They have so many projects and are involved in so many tech facets that they will almost certainly be around for a long time. 

I know Ive stated a lot of preferential bias for and against, which is probably not the ideal mindset for an investor.

We were talking today about how people tend to be risk-averse when looking at potential gains (“I want a sure thing”) and risk-prone when facing losses (“I’ll take a risk because I *really* don’t want to lose money”). My professor brings up the stock market and explains how this phenomenon tends to make a lot of people sell winners too early because they want to cash in on their earnings and hold on to losers for too long because of the prospect of getting their money back. All of this makes sense, right?

Then she asks if any of us have an example. I told her I invested about $25k of my college fund in FB at $25/share and sold at $75/share, making me about $50k. She said that that was a “bad decision” because FB is worth over $200 now.

I can’t seriously believe that some people view investing like that. Are we just supposed to hold our stocks until the day before a cliff and then magically sell them before their value plummets? Is selling once you’ve made a fair amount of profit an undesirable outcome? I sold my shares because 1) I didn’t want to lose that much from my college fund and 2) I began to lose sight of what Facebook was attempting to accomplish as a company. I don’t think it’s good just to have your money sitting in a company hoping it’s going to appreciate in value.

I came across an interesting ETF that uses an option collar strategy to protect against downside risk That is, it sells calls against the underlying securities and then uses the revenue to buy protective puts.

It's called **NUSI**, or *Nationwide Risk-Managed Income ETF*.

It's appealing to me for a few reasons:

* I looked at its performance during the recent crash and it outperformed everything else (SPY, QQQ, etc.): [https://i.imgur.com/y8p6uFb.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/y8p6uFb.jpg[/img])
* It pays out a generous dividend from the sale of call options, at an amount that is competitive with bond funds: [7.71%](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/funds-and-etfs/nusi/dividend-history) 
* Although it has a higher expense ratio, it would be easier to buy this than try to build my own downside protection (e.g., buying protective puts), which can be a full time job. 

My goals would be to avoid inflation risk and have reasonable returns without a large drawdown.

I had two questions:

1. What might be the risks with buying this ETF?
2. What would the tax treatment be when the stocks they trade have protective puts on them? I believe it resets the clock on capital gains. Are those taxes deducted by the fund manager from the overall returns or does it get paid by the holder when the 1099 is distributed?
