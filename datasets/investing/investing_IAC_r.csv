2021-03-26 13:20:13,VIAC oversold. Comparison inside.,"Hey, I’ve been tracking VIAC since last March as it skyrocketed up to $100. 

I’m looking at the book value and it’s $24.91 (1.9 ratio). To compare:
Disney: $47.20/3.9
Comcast: $19.72/2.79
Netflix $24.98/20.34

I’m sure there are other good ones to compare in the sector. I had some down at $13.50 from pandemic low’s and I did pick up more at $50. The book value is good. Their balance sheet had 2.98B cash, and they raised another $3B cash. Lots of investment opportunities for them to make with the cash. I believe they are going to take 1.25B and invest in their studios and sound stages (apparently demand for supply exceeds sound stages)  https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-25-billion-overhaul-bring-120028975.html

Looking at their balance sheets and actions I think under $50 is a steal. 
I’m not a financial advisor or expert. But a year ago someone here helped me get VIAC on my radar and I wanted to return a favor to the community, and you should add this to your watch list.",46,0.8
