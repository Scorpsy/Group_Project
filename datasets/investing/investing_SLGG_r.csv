Welcome...  

Let me start off with the overall market and speculation regarding e Sports.

* [February 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgK9aDsgzl0) Q&amp;A with Ann Hand the CEO at 2:25 - **Great Video to get to know SLGG!**

This graph is a bit simple, but it's clear to see e sports would be lead into the multi-billions. If you're here because you want to read Papa Cohen is going to send us to the moon and you're looking for an exit strategy, then this isn't for you. What we see is E Sports is a mere child in the scheme of things. For you smooth brained apes out there, imagine being able to invest into the coverage of football when people wore leather helmets and baseball players didn't take steroids.   


We can clearly see that SLGG has a market cap of about 156M and the current revenue of E Sports in general is roughy 1.48 Billion in 2020. For sake of argument we can say the 1.48B is strictly revenue and SLGG's cap (not revenue) is around 1/10 that size. So what is to be made of this? We have all witnessed the Gamestop short squeezes and yes, there are parallels... but this investment isn't AMC, BB, GME, or fucking Bed Bath and Beyond. This is a LONG term investment and your entrance point is the most important factor to your returns.  


As provided by [u/brbbins1](https://www.reddit.com/user/brbbins1/) short interest is extremely high. I'll repost his DD here.

...but in regard to short interests and squeezes does this look familiar at all?

If you're looking me to say that SLGG will moon and this will be another short squeeze meme play.. then you're wrong. Could it 100% gain.. definitely so, but dickheads on this subreddit are far too concerned with SLGG being the next GME to realize it's full potential. In my opinion, SLGG lacks the overall attention and coverage gamestop had to recreate the same squeeze. That isn't to say a similar squeeze couldn't be much more powerful or stronger than GME's, but we are missing the catalysts and buying power to do so. Regardless, as posted before, E Sports is in an infancy stage and basing your investment worth off a squeeze will prove detrimental to not only yourself, but the growth of the brand. Let me remind you that investing into a company via stock is investing into the brand. Forget whatever the fuck Ryan Cohen is doing and if GME just rose 10%. Focus on what SLGG needs to thrust itself into being a household name. Everyone has shopped at a Gamestop... what the fuck is a super league in comparison. Stop comparing. An acquisition by GME would not only stunt SLGG's growth, but it would be very ill timed while Gamestop is filing for shares to be sold and a possible recount to fuck the SEC.  


 Yes, i'm aware that the SEC put out new rules for shorts to be announced within a period much shorter than 30 days as before. The reality is, what make you think these motherfuckers won't play hot potatoes like it's their kid's 5th birthday in order to neglect ownership of shorted shares. What we saw with Gamestop very well might be one of a lifetime and SLGG stock holders need to stop pretending this shit is crypto. You're in this for the long term 1-10 years... or you're playing yourself. Simple as that.  


We will be faced with massive shorts. SLGG could hit $4. Who gives a flying fuck if you understand what you're invested into. By the time big hedge money even gets close to bankrupting this company... the same GME board that you dickride to buy out SLGG will likely step in. I'm not saying we need GME involvement at all. What i'm saying is, SLGG is a low hanging fruit that can't be mentioned  on WSB. We have 1.8k members here compared to 9 million. Meaning, if we had the type of attention these other subreddits got, then popping this 600% squeeze wouldn't be an issue at all.   
Furthermore, the SLGG and GME camps share board members of the same kin. You really think that a company that just burst a short squeeze would let their fellow e sports company crumble under bankruptcy due to shortage? It's obvious they would step in because they're fighting the same battle. This isn't the catalyst we need, though. It is besides the fact.   


We see this with prototype Gamestop locations that are lan centers. We see this with all of the partnerships behind the scenes literally making a conglomerate. If you're too lazy too figure that out and want gains, then sell. Otherwise, be in for a turbulent storm and the ultimate cure to this all is bringing more attention to the overall true value of SLGG. There are plenty other E Sports stocks, but SLGG holds the right ti a patent that can't be replicated or duplicated.   


They hold the rights to in person 3rd person bot viewing of ANY game for display. This means movie theaters, gaming hubs, e sports betting, and might very well conflict what Twitch and Youtube have going on. Stop asking for price predictions. Stop waiting for whales to invest and just fucking HOLD. Buy the dips and lower your cost average if needed (not financial advice), but stop sitting here waiting for someone to save you on your delinquent ass mis-informed gamble. Study the company and push the company if you believe in it. That is the essence of shareholding.",21,0.64
