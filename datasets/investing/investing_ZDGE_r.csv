**The growth story**

While zedge’s user growth has been unimpressive over the pandemic (13.7% for installs and 3.3% for monthly active users), its revenue growth is likely behind its recent increase in stock price.

&#x200B;

**Q2 2020: $2.6M Revenue, $0.1M Earnings, $0.026 ARPMAU, $0.6M cash flow**

**Q2 2021: $5.3M Revenue, $2.5M earnings $0.049 ARPMAU, $2.3M cash flow**

&#x200B;

**101%** revenue growth, **3087%** earnings growth, **87.7%** ARPMAU growth, **269%** cash flow growth

&#x200B;

Zedge has had revenue growth quarter on quarter for the past three quarters, with advertising revenue being the main driver.

This growth was due to “optimization of ad waterfall and an increase in advertising rates relating to year-end ad budge”, as per their most recent earnings call.

While I could talk about more numbers, I think it would be easier to look at the 3rd table from their latest [earnings report](https://investor.zedge.net/prviewer/release_only/id/4658616).

This 100% revenue increase has occurred while operating expenses have stayed almost the same, increasing marginally from **$2.25M to $2.4M**, leading to greater profit margins.

Management is forecasting revenue to increase between **75% to 80%** for FY21, which would be an increase in revenues from **$9.4m to $16.45M**. (Management were previously

**Heavy Insider buying**

The stock has seen significant insider buying by the CEO and directors as early as when the stock price was $1 in March of 2020. The good news is that this insider buying has continued on the way up, with insider buying by the CEO and a director at $7 on 01/19/20 and 01/20/20. This (almost) cluster buy shows a high level of conviction by insiders in their company.

However, the CFO did sell at $15 on 03/24/21, but when the stock price has risen this much (almost 1400%) it is natural to take some profits, so this does not worry me. The CEO and director are still yet to reduce their holdings.

**Solid balance sheet**

According to yahoo finance, Zedge has a **current ratio of 4.65.**

It is cash rich with over **$13.5M** on the balance sheet, and almost debt free with only **492k.**

\*\*In their latest earnings call, they have said that they would like to acquire a company related to ""\*\*mobile gaming, social video, and even mindfulness""

**A reasonable valuation**

As of writing, Zedge trades for **$12.55**, a **25% decrease from its high of $16.93**, which it reached after its stellar earnings report. This tumble in stock price has not been due to any news or change in fundamentals and likely due to the recent downturn in tech and growth stocks.

Zedge, at its current price has a **P/S ratio of 13** based on TTM revenue. If revenue meets management’s guidance for FY21, it trades at a P/S ratio of 10.5.

The **PE ratio is currently 45**, and the forward p/e is 29 based on analyst recommendations. Prior to the most recent earnings release, the stock was trading at a 130 PE ratio

Although this is not cheap, this in my opinion is a reasonable valuation for an almost adtech-like company that is experiencing rapid growth. I believe that this stock would have been trading upwards of $20 dollars if it weren’t for the recent downturn in growth tech stocks.

If we value the stock at a forward PE ratio of 50, my price target for this stock is **$21.60**, ( which is a conservative estimate considering that this is a growth tech stock. The price target by analysts is **$24** (although price targets often mean very little.) This could certainly go much further should market conditions for growth stocks change.

The company could also expand into the NFT market, as it provides a marketplace for unique content like wallpapers. However, this is pure speculation and should not be the reason for investment.

When considering risks, there is the possibility that growth in advertising revenue starts to slow down, however management see no sign of this currently due to their current forecasts. It may be important to note management were forecasting 20% revenue growth for FY21 in prior earnings calls.
