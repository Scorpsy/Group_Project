I found out that MKTY was pretty interesting.  
They don't operate as RIOT and MARA.

**MKTY Edge:**

* Operates at lower cost than MARA, and 4x cheaper than RIOT
* Managed by a PE firm
* Is more likely to be resilient to volality, since they sell their the currency mined
* Currently operating a 2.2 MW Facility in Washington State, and plans to expand to 50MW by end of the year. All their equipment has been bought from another miner bankruptcy from a few years ago (â†’ not subject to shortage equipment as opposed to any other competitor)

**Cost to mine**

* **MKTY energy cost: 0.024$ / KwH**
* Mara energy cost: 0.028$ / KwH
* Riot energy cost: 0.08$ / KwH (historial energy cost)

**Currently trading at an heavy discount compared to MARA and RIOT**

* Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of RIOT : 423x
* Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of MARA: 995x
* **Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of MKTY: 12x**

**Why is MKTY under-the-radar?**

* Recently uplisted on the Nasdaq
* Small Market Cap ($120mm)
* Management team focussing on execution rather than PR
* Low float & high insider ownership (40%)
* Low volume (about 90k shares / day)

**Conclusion**  
MKTY sounds like a company to keep an eye on given all these reasons.
