In the *trial*, QR-421a demonstrated benefit on multiple measures of vision that moved in concordance, including visual acuity, visual fields, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) retinal imaging, after a single dose. QR-421a was observed to be well tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. Based on these findings, the Company plans to advance QR-421a to two parallel pivotal *Phase* 2/3 *trial*s by year end 2021 – one in early-moderate patients, one in advanced patients.

""We're pleased to have met all the objectives we set for the *Stellar* *trial*, including determining suitable registration endpoints, the dose, dosing interval, and patient population for the *Phase* 2/3 pivotal *trial*s,"" said Aniz Girach, MD, Chief Medical Officer of ProQR, ""With just a single dose, QR-421a demonstrated *clinical* proof of concept with benefit observed in treated eyes compared to the untreated eyes in multiple concordant measures of vision. As expected, we saw benefits in both advanced and early-moderate patients in this slow progressing, debilitating eye disease, allowing us to advance this important investigational therapy for all patients with Usher syndrome and nsRP due to *USH2A* exon 13 mutations. Based on preliminary Regulatory guidance, we plan to submit protocols to advance QR-421a to pivotal testing. This is our second program targeting a severe inherited retinal disease that is moving into pivotal *trial*s, which we believe further validates our RNA therapy platform and our capabilities to design and efficiently take these programs through *clinical* *develop*ment.""

""The safety profile and efficacy findings for QR-421a are very encouraging,"" said Robert Koenekoop, MD, MSc, PhD, FRCS(C), FARVO, a *clinical*\-scientist from the Montreal Children's Hospital and Professor of the McGill University Faculty of Medicine and Department of Pediatric Surgery. ""Usher syndrome and non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa due to *USH2A* exon 13 mutations are devastating retinal diseases representing a high unmet medical need, as there are no approved therapies to treat the severe vision loss associated with these diseases. Patients' biggest hope for a therapy is to stop disease progression and prevent vision loss, and these findings suggest that QR-421a has the potential to stabilize vision. I look forward to this exciting program advancing into pivotal *trial* *develop*ment."" ",4,0.61
