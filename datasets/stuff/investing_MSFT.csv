2021-02-08 20:55:38,Microsoft $MSFT stock looking bullish and may have a possible surprise announcement soon!,"Last year, in 2020 MSFT had a strong rally of 43% to record highs for the year.

The earnings released on January 26th show MSFT beat earnings and revenue expectations for the eighth straight quarter as reported on the last earnings report about two weeks ago. Earnings of $2.03 per share easily topped expectations by 39 cents, while revenue of $43.08 billion grew almost 17% year over year and beat estimates by more than $2.8 billion.

Since the release of this earnings report, the stock value has been uncharacteristically quiet and only hovering around the $242 range.

This made me investigate what’s going on and I discovered over 12 Microsoft executives acquired common stocks as recently reported on February 1st with the SEC Form 4 filings. I calculated 1,348,758 common stock shares that were acquired by Microsoft leadership in the last month.

This potentially means MSFT will be releasing some big news in the near future. Potentially even as early as the next couple of weeks and I believe it will be either an M&A, a new technology product, or a large government contract to make all these executives acquire common stocks at the all-time high price.

I picked up 500 call options as I’m conservatively estimating their stocks might increase over $250 in the next two weeks.

Another thing to note is ARK Investment Management LLC reported a 30.67% increase in their ownership of MSFT / Microsoft Corp about three months ago. ARK does a lot better investigating potential disruptive technologies so they might have been previewed to some knowledge that helped them decide to increase their position that much.

This is not financial advice and just my opinions. Please do your own DD before making any financial investments. Also please share your thoughts and insights on this as I am also thinking about buying some long-term shares tomorrow depending on what others mention or discovered.

EDIT: I replaced the word ""bought"" with ""aquired"" to reflect the verbiage of the SEC Form 4 filings. Apparently acquired could mean they were awarded, exercised options, or other means. I also removed the word ""insider"".",111,0.64

2020-12-31 01:56:46,What is your long-term view of MSFT?,"The reason I’m asking is because when the discussion arises about the biggest tech companies and their possible upside in the future I mainly see the likes of AAPL, GOOGL and FB being mentioned. Microsoft however doesn’t seem to be named a lot. 

So I’m curious how people on this subreddit look at the company in the long-term. I’m quite bullish on them to be realizing the same amount of gains in the future as these other companies given the very solid foundations the company can rely on and they have the means to jump into any project they want.

2020-11-07 18:06:43,"I have AMZN, FB, and MSFT - I want to drop one and consolidate my positions into two. Which would you choose?","The case for AMZN - it can grow in so many directions and has surprised us time and time again.

The case for FB - leader in social networking. sure, they've maxed out on users, but they are opening other revenue streams with instagram.

The case for MSFT - just a steady beast. growth is not that sexy and has been a lame duck in my portfolio. Sure, Azure is hot, but it's competing with AWS, so I feel there's some duplication here. 

Honestly, I'm leaning towards dropping MSFT - getting greedy. The other side of me wants to keep MSFT because it's the ""safest"" out of the three.

Thoughts?

2020-08-28 08:17:31,"With MSFT, AAPL AMZN, GOOGL and FB making up more than 1/5 of the S&P500, what are practical ways to de-risk your portfolio from this imbalance?","For those who subscribe to having the majority or the entirety of their equity holdings to consist of ETF/funds from the S&P 500, the impact to their portfolio as a function of any one company has increased substantially.

Even with total market funds like Vanguard's VTI, these five stocks make up an outsized portion of the fund because of market cap weight.  

Much like investors using ""ex-US"" funds to increase exposure to international holdings, are there funds that are ""ex-FAANG"" so individuals can lessen the impact?  If not, would another practical strategy be to buy more non-tech sector funds as opposed to say buy more of the 400+ other S&P 500 stocks as counterweight.

Thoughts?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**EDIT1:**  /u/exaggerate_a_point summed up my ask better than my own attempt so I'll add it here instead of responding to similar comments:

> OP specifically said he/she wants to de-risk, aka diversify. It's not about not holding good companies, it's about hedging the risk if one has a bad series of news or events. It's inherently risky if your portfolio is heavily weighted in a handful of companies.

Another good summary of the ask for this discussion from /u/FerociousGiraffe :

>Trying to move your portfolio away from FAANG isn’t to say those are great, successful, hugely profitable companies. You’d keep a position in them. It’s about protecting against news that will only hurt FAANG while not hurting the broader market.

**EDIT2:**  For comments related to balancing with international equities, this discussion is contained for U.S. equities.  Assume whatever percentage of bonds, precious metals, digital currency, international equities or whatever you think is appropriate in a portfolio has been addressed.

**EDIT3:**  Outside of suggestions like ""Why do you hate winning?"", some of the top solutions to dilute these stocks from your S&P 500 / U.S. equities part of a portfolio:

* Many suggest a variation of my original post of simply adding more sector funds outside of tech.  Though this strategy will unfortunately remove many non-giant tech companies in this sector.

* Many of you like /u/desquibnt suggests equal weighted ETFs like RSP.  However, RSP has a high net expense ratio of 0.20%.  

* /u/TriathlonNerd suggests a reverse cap weighted ETF like RVRS.  This too has a high net expense ratio of 0.29%.

* /u/BubbyginkESO and others suggests going broader than just 500 companies with low cost total market funds like Vanguard's VTI or Fidelity's FZROX.  While these 5 stocks still make up the top holdings, the effect of a larger basket of stocks also dilutes these companies.  So far, I like this simple and practical one the best.",1761,0.96

2020-12-26 19:30:08,Diversifying away from MSFT,"Thanks to my job I've accumulated a lot of shares of MSFT.  Though I'm definitely long-term bullish on the company, thanks to both RSUs and the employee stock purchase program it's grown to be my 2nd largest position (and my largest is VTSAX which also contains a lot of MSFT...)

I was wondering if I could get some suggestions of things to diversify away from MSFT, some thoughts I had are:

\- Small or mid cap ETFs, maybe VO or VB

\- REITs, don't know much about these

\- Sector or region specific, such as health care

\- Crypto, a small percent at most

I'm interested in mid and high risk investment options, since I'm young and have a long time horizon.  I prefer index funds and ETFs since I don't have the patience to read a lot about companies or the market and trying to pick good stocks.  I'm also not at a place where I'm ready to invest in real estate but hope to be in \~5 years, so I'm interested in some value-holding, safer investments, but overall I have a pretty high risk tolerance (kept buying all through 2020) and am looking for long term growth.

Thanks in advance for any advice.",32,0.79
2020-09-22 08:23:35,"Video explaining the huge growth of large cap growth stocks (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, FB, GOOGL)","I've seen this question everywhere on this sub: ""why did apple/tesla/[insert large growth company name here] growth so much so quick! They still haven't made a lot of profit! We are in a bubble!""

Well, it is difficult to explain why to every person individually and this new video from Ben Felix explains the reason why expertly.

https://youtu.be/foqswJT3Spc

The conclusion the video comes to is that you should just stick to low cost index funds (preferably globally diversified) rather than investing into large cap growth or trying to find the next Apple or Amazon.

**EDIT:** The definition of a ""growth"" company (as literally explained in the video) is a company that is ""expensive"" relative to the market. Expensive how? Well, relative to some fundamental ratio like P/B or P/E. Considering all the companies I have listed in my title have relatively high P/E and P/B ratios, you can say they are expensive. This makes them by definition a growth company. This isn't that hard to understand. If I said they are tech companies, no one would argue because they literally are tech companies. Well, just as much as they are tech companies, they are growth companies. They might not all be as expensive as each other, but relative to the market, they are expensive.

I am not commenting about how all these companies are as overbought as each other, or they are the same in every metric, I just listed some large-cap growth companies based on the definition of growth being expensive.",962,0.91
2021-01-27 04:57:43,Microsoft (MSFT) vs Intel (INTC)," We constantly compare stocks in similar sectors. Below an extract of our comparison between Microsoft and Intel

&#x200B;

One of our key metrics is the Price to Stockholders equity per share ratio. When looking at this we find the following:

* Price/Stockholders equity per share for Microsoft: 13.5
* Price/Stockholders equity per share for Intel Corp : 2.8

Based on this metric Intel Corp offers far more value than Microsoft. Most firms tend to trade at a ratio of between 2 and 5 times. While Intel trades within this range the stock if Microsoft is trading well outside this expected range. So what is the stockholders equity per share you ask? Well if a firm sells all assets, pays all its debts and distributes the rest to its stockholders, the stockholders equity per share shows what each stockholders will get. Thus the higher this ratio the less you will get out per stock compared to what you are paying for it. So Microsofit that is trading at 13.5 times it stockholders equity you will only get 7.5% of its current stock price out of they were to sell all assets, pay all debt and distribute the rest to stockholders. In the case of Intel you would get out 35.7% of its current stock price  


Next up cash as percentage of stock price:

* Cash as percentage of stock price for Microsoft: 0.81%
* Cash as percentage of stock price for Intel Corp : 2.6%

Next up lets take a look at the percentage cash on the balance sheet makes up of each group's total assets:

* Cash as percentage of stock price for Microsoft: 4.7%
* Cash as percentage of stock price for Intel Corp : 3.8%

Looking at the cash position of the three firms Microsoft has the strongest cash position (as a percentage of their total assets). The cash per share gives an indication of if investors were to buy the stock now, how much of that stock price is made up by cash on their balance sheet. In this case its Intel that comes out on top with 2.6% of their current stock price being made up by cash.   


Next the overused but still useful metric, the Price to Earnings Ratio (PE):

* PE for Microsoft:29
* PE for Intel Corp : 9.8

So  Intel has the lower PE ratio of the two firms looked at in this comparison  


Price/Stock Valuation ratio:

* Price/Stock Valuation for Microsoft: 1.27
* Price/Stock Valuation for Intel Corp : 0.76

Based on the Price/Stock valuation metric it is Intel that comes out as the winner as its trading at well below our stock price target while Microsoft is trading at well above our stock valuation for it.  


If we have to chose one of these two tech giants, based on their stock price performance, their financial results and other financial ratios we rate the stock of Intel as the **winner**.",0,0.46

2020-08-20 10:54:17,"Why is GOOG worth so much less than AAPL, AMZN, MSFT?","At time of writing, GOOG market cap is $1.06T and other tech giants are much higher (AAPL is $2.01T, AMZN is $1.65T, MSFT is $1.61T). That gap feels large to me. Also, FB is valued at $760B with much lower revenue and decelerating growth, so its gap vs GOOG seems small. 

Is GOOG a good buy? Are these other companies just overvalued? Curious what you all think.  
Here's my thinking:

* GOOG has rock-solid fundamentals - excellent gross margins, has maintained \~15%+ YoY revenue growth even at their scale, and search is a steady business with many entrypoints across the Google ecosystem
* GOOG has bets across so many forward-looking industries that I think they will be able to diversify over time and don't have real risk of not continuing to innovate. There's of course the risk of anti-trust and privacy regulations, but that's been true for years now (although things do appear to be ratcheting up).
* It seems their stock hasn't mooned during covid because a meaningful share of search volume (and subsequently search revenue) comes from brick-and-mortar businesses (as opposed to someone like FB, whose ads biz is more of an ecommerce/direct-to-consumer play), which puts a drag on their revenue. This was the main reason for their relatively weak Q2 earnings a couple weeks back.

2020-10-21 14:53:24,MSFT as a part of your stocks,"MSFT is big part of the Technology industry. Microsoft's market cap is $1,686.5 billion. It makes up 5.95% of VOO the vanguard SandP 500 ETf and 10.78% of QQQ the Nasdaq 100 ETF. It has many products that make up a big part of the world such as Github, Azure,Dynamics 365,LinkedIn ,Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Xbox and all of their stores that sell computers and laptops. Their Moat is being heavily diversified among many industries that will continue to grow and succeed in the future. Revenue in Q4 2020 was $38.0 billion and increased 13% from Q3 2020. Of that Revenue in Productivity and Business Processes was $11.8 billion and increased 6%. Some highlights in this industry was Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 5% driven by Office 365 Commercial revenue growth of 19%,   Office Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 6% and Office 365 Consumer subscribers increased to 42.7 million,  LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and  Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 13% driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 38% .   Revenue in Intelligent Cloud was $13.4 billion and increased 17%, with the really cool part of Azure revenue growth of 47%. This shows that the cloud or Azure is growing massively as the Industry is still very new and growing rapidly very year. Revenue in More Personal Computing was $12.9 billion and increased 14% with an interesting point of  Xbox content and services revenue increased 65% . The 4th gen Xbox will be released in the later half of 2020 which should include many amounts of Revenue for Microsoft. Microsoft had a total revenue of  $143.0 billion and increased 14% YOY.

Now we shall look at some of the Financials of MSFT. MSFT has $136.527B cash on hand as of Q4 2020. That could buy Starbucks and still have 40 billion USD left over. They have a P/E ratio of 38.76 which can be considered rich but compared with other Tech companies such as AMZN with a P/E ratio of 128.17 and APPl with a P/E ratio of 36.83. This is in line with the coamnpies with a similar market cap.  The Debt to Equity is  0.50. which is very good for a company with MSFT stature. MSFT dividend is $2.04 with a dividend with a yield of 0.92% which is alright for a growth company. The Profit margin is 30.96% which is ridiculous for such a highly valued company. MSFT P/S ratio is 11.55 which alright considering their market cap. The P/B ratio is 13.70 which is high but considering other tech companies such as AAPL with a P/B of 27.5 and AMZN with P/B ratio of 21.86. They have debt but their total assets outweigh their liabilities. MSFT share holder  equity is $118.304B which is very good for them. 

Future Growth and my price target for Microsoft 

 Cloud computing service is a market which is somewhat new but is rapidly expanding. Microsoft Azure is about a third of MSFT revenue but it will grow faster and faster as the  cloud computing service market grows. It is currently worth about $371.4 Billion in 2020 and it is projected in 2025 to be  $832.1 Billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 17.5%.  Also MSFT will continue to supe up the next generation Xbox with new gaming studios and Xbox exclusives. MSFt is also trying to get into the 5G business and it has also created a strategic partnership with Starlink which will give many people faster internet which will MSFT in the long term. MSFT is very stable and increasing on markets that grow very quickly and that will add to its MOAT and it will continue to grow. My price target in 2025  is 445 USD which is about a 100 percent return.",37,0.75

Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

&#x200B;

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

**TLDR**: If you use fidelity watch your account closely.  They seem to have a serious bug which adversely affects your account value. My impacted account is a boring buy and hold account.

2020-08-27 07:11:45,$MSFT - takeaways from virtual investor meeting at Goldman yesterday,"Goldman hosted a virtual NDR with Michael Spencer, General Manager - Investor Relations at $MSFT\* yesterday. Goldman has a Buy rating and $235 price target. Here are their takeaways:

1. Azure: Recall, in 4Q20, Azure growth decelerated to 47% yoy (50% cc) compared to 59% growth in 3Q20 (61% cc). Investors continue to focus on the pace of deceleration within Azure, the impact of COVID-19 on cloud migrations and consumption, and changes in the revenue mix between consumption (IaaS and PaaS) and the per user SaaS revenue (EMS). Management noted several puts and takes to the impact of COVID-19 on Azure growth, noting some impact in consumption in heavily impacted industries and a focus on optimization, noting however that the overall trend has been customers redoubling their commitment to migrating to the public cloud. Management added, that as the pace of growth in EMS moderates, with enterprise mobility seats growing 26% yoy in 4Q20 versus 34% in F3Q20, there will be a corresponding impact to overall Azure growth as the revenue mix continues to shift more towards IaaS and PaaS.
2. Commercial Cloud Gross Margins: Management noted continuous improvement in IaaS and PaaS gross margins, as the company continues to expand capacity within its existing datacenter footprint, increase power efficiency, and optimize the company’s existing software stack to run more efficiently. However, management noted the pace of margin expansion within Azure will be partially offset as revenue mixes more towards lower gross margin consumption revenue (and away from SaaS). Recall, in 4Q20 Commercial Cloud gross margins reached 66% (+1pt yoy) compared to 67% in F3Q20 (+4pts yoy), highlighting the impact from moderating revenue growth in the Azure per user business.
3. Office 365: Recall in 4Q20 Office 365 commercial seat growth moderated to 15% yoy, compared to 20% in F3Q20. Management attributed some of the slowdown to better than expected adoption of a 6 month E1 free trial the company introduced following COVID19 (which ended in June) along with some weakness within SMB. Management also noted strength in the pipeline with the opportunity to convert free trial customers to paid users as the trials expire. Management noted continued room for APRU growth driven by SKU migration with a large E1 installed base noting traction in E3 and E5 SKUs; strength in E5 has been driven in part by advanced security and compliance offerings. With respect to Teams, management noted a number of enhancements in recent months as the company continues to close the feature functionality gap relative to competitive offerings in both collaboration and videoconferencing software.
4. Windows: Management highlighted that Windows Commercial continues to grow as a percentage of overall Windows revenue (\~30% as of 2Q20) driving the mix of recurring revenue higher within the segment. Windows Pro, Windows Non-Pro, and Other comprise the remaining \~40%, \~20% and 10% respectively. Management noted commercial PC strength following mid-March shelter in place orders began to fade in 4Q; however, this was offset by strength in the consumer market. Going forward, management pointed to expectations for a low-teens decline in the Windows OEM business driven by continued weakness in SMB and a tough compare.
5. Gaming: With more people working from home, gaming continues to show strength, with gaming revenue growing 64% yoy in F4Q20. Heading into an upcoming console cycle management noted that increased demand associated with WFH should result in lower inventory levels relative to prior console cycles. Management also noted balanced strength throughout the company’s gaming portfolio in 4Q20, with strength in first party titles and the company’s subscription business which surpassed 10mn subscribers in April.",50,0.87
2020-09-15 11:31:31,$MSFT - xCloud will be a game changer,"Microsoft is beginning an open beta of their new streaming service xCloud offering game streaming for mobile devices. xCloud is bundled with their current Xbox Game Pass service and with the newest generation of consoles coming to market this holiday season there will be huge potential for this service to take off. I believe they can overcome the difficulties that Google faced with Stadia. Watching beta testers use this service on their mobile devices, I'm very confident this will be a success especially with the news recently surrounding Sony's PS5 chip.

*""Overall, we see COVID-19 as a catalyst for cloud usage, with companies accelerating their shift to digital and their employees working remotely. Our CIO survey and Azure’s June-quarter performance lead us to believe that while usage is higher, cloud computing sales growth is decelerating.

2020-07-23 15:08:35,MSFT & APPL reasonable entry point,"Looking to get some shares in Msft and Appl. Today, they have been discounted.

&#x200B;

However, Msft is still only -6% from its ATH, and Appl -7%. They are still very close to ATH in these times of uncertainty.

I'm in for the long term, but what would you say it's a good entry point?

&#x200B;

I'm ooking to buy about $5000 of each, around 25 shares of Msft and 13 of Appl. So, even if the stock is $5 lower, for ex., that would mean around $200 in savings, which would give me another Msft share.

&#x200B;

I know $200 is not much in the long term, but the possibility of having another Msft share just by entering $5 lower seems really enticing.

2021-02-04 05:39:29,10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.  Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why:

1. THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, [https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq](https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq) .  The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work).  Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO.  A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs.  Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade.
2. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, [https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/](https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/) .  This ETF is... highly intriguing.  It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%).  They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM.  Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily).  What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology.  Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit.  The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO.  The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB.   SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF.  Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive.

3. DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl) .  Its methodology is in the prospectus, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus) .  Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to [etfrc.com](https://etfrc.com). So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way.  Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ.  Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF!
4. SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund) . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change.""  ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s) ).  Methodology here: [https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index](https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index) .  It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in.  It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year!
5. FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, [https://freedometfs.com/frdm/](https://freedometfs.com/frdm/) . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores.  Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red.  If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like.  Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF.  Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox!
6. EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund) . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index.  Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil.  It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all).  Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung.
7. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf) .  One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets.  Really heavy on tech and luxury.  If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like.  High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH.
8. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, [https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html](https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html) .  Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options.  Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times.  Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF.  Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement.  Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X.
9. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, [https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx) .  Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries.  But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure.  Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund.  There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design.
10. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf) .  This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF.  You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise.  But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values.  Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk.  A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields.

ok, here's a bonus #11:

11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA) .  This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year.  But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted.  US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along.  Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector.

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future.

What do you guys think?  Any of those look like something you might invest in?  Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?

2020-08-27 14:20:14,MSFT Stock Split?,"How likely are the chances of MSFT splitting their stock in the near future? We've already seen other gigantic companies like AAPL and TSLA split to allow smaller  investors to purchase their shares.

Wouldn't a stock split drive MSFT's stock price higher (in the short term), as splits are usually viewed as a good sign? Could there be any reasons why MSFT would like to avoid a stock split, or if a split might actually happen?

MSFT and WMT, as we all already know, are near closing a deal with ByteDance to acquire TikTok, and assuming they are successful in doing so, MSFT's stock price will shoot up from an already ATH, so I'd argue a stock split makes a lot of sense.

Any thoughts?",1,0.52
2021-02-23 11:24:56,Watch your P/S Ratio. P/S over 30 is incredibly risky.,"**What is a P/S ratio?** 

Price / Sales ratio. The higher the number, the more expensive the stock is compared to sales.

**What about P/E ratio?** 

Price / Earnings ratio is great for mature companies, but the hottest stocks typically lose money, so P/S is a quick and lazy proxy.

**Got an example?** 

Take AAPL's Market Cap of $2113B and TTM sales of $294B. 2113/294=7. So the P/S ratio of AAPL is 7. Is that good or bad? Well it depends on the industry. Typically Apple has a PS ratio of 2-5. APPL had a PS ratio of 7 at the end of 2007, and we all know what happened in 2008, right?

**What does the P/S ratio have to do with anything?**

There are currently [54 stocks with a PS over 30](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=121&f=cap_largeover,fa_ps_o10&o=-ps&r=41).

The stocks with the highest P/S ratio [are getting hit the hardest](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=141&f=cap_largeover,fa_ps_o10&o=-ps).

**Is having a PS ratio over 30 bad?** 

Historically, anything with a P/S over 30 underperforms as an investment. The revenue growth will outperform, but the overall stock still underperforms, because all that revenue growth was already priced in.  None of the FANG stocks ever exceeded a P/S ratio of 25. MSFT had a PS ratio of about 28 back in 1999, and it took 17 years for the price to recover. 

**When was the last time we had this many stocks with a P/S over 30?** 

At the end of 1999 we had 22, making up 6.70% of US market cap. From 2001-2019 we had very few. At the end of 2020 we had 50, making up 4.80% of US market cap. 

**How significant is this?** 

I don't know, man. 5% of the market is not significant. Also, there isn't a lot of data, only 31 stocks went over a P/S ratio of 30 from 2001-2019 (the other 85 instances occurred in 2000 & 2020.)  Also it's worth noting the valuation of all stocks [has been trending up](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-sales) because of low rates. Yay?

**What should you do?** 

I don't know, man. I am not a broker/ dealer. This is not advice. You can quickly check your individual stocks P/S ratio on [finviz](https://finviz.com/). P/S over 10 is red, which means you should dig deeper.

**Edit:** No I am not implying Apple caused the housing bubble to pop in 2008. Let me be specific. From 2007 to 2008 Apples revenue went up (24b to 32b), earnings went up (3.4b-4.8b), but its stock fell (180-85). During a recession, mr market is less inclined to pay a premium for growth stocks.",424,0.77

2021-01-24 05:09:56,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

2021-02-09 04:23:19,Second Quarter Results: 6 months into the /r/investing underrated stock survey and the average return was 72% (37% as a portfolio),"Building on a previous post ([http://redd.it/i2thge/](http://redd.it/i2thge/)) asking the community to pick underrated stocks, there was interest in seeing the quarterly performance of everyone's picks

The first quarter can be seen here: [http://redd.it/jti14m/](http://redd.it/jti14m/)

For this quarter, the key takeaways are as follows:

* Overall average return of 72.2% (driven by the GME pick)
* If you invested equally in each stock, returns would have been 41.9%, or if you bought one of each stock, returns would have been 37.5%
* 86% of the 254 picks have shown a positive return, with 80% greater than 10% return and 20% greater than 100% return
* Highest returning pick: Gamestock (GME) at 1342% flagged by  /u/EmployerOfTheMonth, to which they stated *""If it goes up, people will think I'm some sort genius for going against the crowd, if it goes down, people will just mindly brush me off as a moron for actually thinking this was underrated""*
* If you invested in the top 5 most upvoted stocks (NET, CRSP, STNE, NVDA, NOK), you would have seen an average return of 62%
* If you invested in the top 5 most controversial stocks (TSLA, WD, AMD, LMND, UBER), you would have seen a return of 93%
* If you had invested equally in the stocks with greater than 10% return in the first 30 days, your total return would be 53.1%

In graphical format, you can also see the results here: [https://i.imgur.com/CzEYTxv.png](https://i.imgur.com/CzEYTxv.png)

# For those who keep asking for another round of tracking underrated stocks, I'll add a comment below to collect new picks to monitor.  Happy to update you on a similar cadence.

As a reminder, please do not interpret results seen here as an endorsement of the investing prowess of the community. Invest at your own risk.

For those also interested, there was a stock picking survey back in October of 2018.  That overall portfolio is up 58% with an average return of 138% (driven by the triple digit gains in Enpahse and Tesla).  You can see the original picks in my history; happy to provide an update on that one if there is interest.",733,0.97
2021-02-14 06:50:25,Analysing Institutional Investor Transactions,"Hi all, I came up with a good way to extract institutional investor transactions using Python from an API in order to analyse if investors are buying or selling stocks in a particular company. 

For example, below table is the outcome showing the transactions reported by institutional investors since the 11th of February on 4 different companies.


    total   buys  sells      total_shares_exchanged
    AAPL  159.0  127.0   32.0           122816727.0
    MSFT  293.0  251.0   42.0             292622179.0
    ETSY   42.0   37.0    5.0               3978781.0
    ATVI  115.0  104.0   11.0               1161650.0


While the data is useful, I am struggling to make a good use of it. For instance, if I look into MSFT, I can see that 127 institutional funds bough stocks in MSFT and 27 sold stocks. 

What I would like to do with this analysis is to find stocks that institutional investors are currently buying a lot. 

Does someone know what would be the best approach to do this? I thought about running the script for a bunch of companies and compare them together. But that approach does not make sense because obviously, large market-cap companies will attract more transactions than small-cap companies and they may not be really comparable.

In case any of you is interested on how to get institutional investor transactions using Python, I have a video showing step by step:

2020-05-20 17:12:46,Could xCloud be a reason to invest heavily in MSFT?,"I already own a decent amount of shares in MSFT, it was one of the blue chip stocks I went for after Black Thursday and have been very happy with performance so far, but I'm looking further down the line now.

Being a casual gamer, I had heard here and there about xCloud but after looking into the idea and technology I am really impressed. I am honestly under the impression that this service could turn MSFT into the Netflix of videogames. The idea itself reshapes the video game industry as we know it. MSFT is already a leader in the industry, has the capital and resources to get this thing up and running as they claim, and has a large base of users that already subscribe to their game pass network.

BUT, I haven't heard any talk from investors or investing sites getting excited about the tech, despite the fact that it's set to launch at the end of a year that has already been pretty good to MSFT's cloud services.

So I wanted to see what others thoughts are. Am I wrong to think that this technology would impact the video game industry in this way?",6,0.65

2020-07-22 10:52:21,Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and MSFT,"The new Microsoft Flight Simulator (out August 18th) is expected to be one of the most incredible simulators of any genre, ever. Just hop on [youtube and watch some previews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GetBM6jc-xI)... it looks stunning.  It has attracted more and more attention, not just from flight sim fans, but even folks who have never dipped their toe into gaming at all. I fall into the latter category myself.

""*Flight Simulator* will feature Asobo's in-house developed game engine, and leverage [Bing Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bing_Maps) data, accessing over two [petabytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petabyte) of data from the [cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) on demand.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_(2020_video_game)#cite_note-:0-4) [Azure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure) [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) analyzes map data and [photogrammetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry) to generate photorealistic 3D models of buildings, trees, terrain, and so on. This allows the simulator to depict most parts of the world in 3D photo-realism, and other parts in high definition.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_(2020_video_game)#cite_note-5) There will also be realistic physics and weather systems, and utilization of real-world weather data. An example used at [E3 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E3_2019) was that if it was raining somewhere in real life, it would be raining in-game. Individual clouds will have their own behaviors and they will impact aircraft performance depending on its location within the system.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_(2020_video_game)#cite_note-6) Asobo has created their own flight model engine, allowing thousands of surfaces and 3D forces and moments to be fully simulated.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_(2020_video_game)#cite_note-:0-4) *Flight Simulator* will populate roads with vehicles, water will flow realistically based on wind direction, grass will have individual grass blades and trees will have individual leaves, creating the illusion of a living world.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_(2020_video_game)#cite_note-7) It will feature over two million cities and towns and more than 40,000 real-world airports.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_(2020_video_game)#cite_note-8)""

This kind of ground-breaking tech seems like it would absolutely be scalable to other programs, games, maps, etc...  tons of applications.

How can the success of this game impact MSFT's share price?",0,0.09
2021-01-18 21:00:22,"If you had to pick just one of the ""mega-cap"" tech stocks to own - which do you buy?","Obviously if you own an index fund you don't have to make this decision, more power to you. For those preferring a more concentrated portfolio style, I think this is an interesting question - because these are all great companies, but naturally one must be better than the others.

If you had to pick just one of the mega-caps, which do you buy today?

My personal thoughts:

- Facebook. I see potential competition to their network, but the balance sheet is a fortress and valuation has been pushed down a bit due to general public hatred. A contrarian pick. (B)

- Apple. In my opinion the valuation of this has run away farther ahead of its earnings relative to the others, making it the least attractive of the bunch for me. (C-)

- Amazon. Doing amazing things, looking at the last several quarters their earnings seem to be accelerating - however the p/e is higher than all the rest. (A-)

- Microsoft. The sleeper choice, solid valuation in addition to growth. Not flashy but a money printer. (A)

- Google. My perception is that they're slipping - taking lots of high risk/high payoff bets that don't appear to be paying off yet. Feels potentially contrarian but I'm not wildly excited. (C)?

- Bonus: Mastercard/Visa. Secular trend away from cash makes these seem like long term great picks, in spite of fin-tech disruptors. Not cheap valuations though. I favor MA over V for efficient use of capital. (B+)

Just my opinions of course. Your thoughts?",161,0.87

My idea is to put it all into MSFT and let it ride for a while because based on my understanding from readings, it seems Microsoft is continuing to solidify their enterprise business and overall it looks well positioned in the market. 

From a technical perspective, it seems that the price level is holding steady in the $17x- $18x range, and with continued positive development, it holds great potential to breakout post Q2 earnings. 

A lot of you guys here are more educated at this than I am, so please give me your thoughts on MSFT, and/or if you can contribute ideas on alternative trading strategies I should explore more in-depth, it would be greatly appreciated
....

My experience in investing is limited. I dabbled in the markets back in 2015/16, and made some bad decisions trying to day trade low value names in hopes that they would shoot up fast, and I made mistakes which ended up costing me about 2k at the time. It sucked, but I look at it as a relatively small price to pay to learn some valuable lessons. I lost motivation though and focused more on my regular job, missing out on the great bull market that ensued after. 

I don't want to make irrational decisions this time around. My primary goal right now is to just make some solid judgement calls and make a positive return on my investment (even if its small), I just want to regain some confidence in my investing self.",3,0.59

There isn't publicly traded company that does not rely on business critical applications that are inherently integrated and controlled through the Company's Active Directory infrastructure. 

Anecdotal, as a Cyber Security Engineer with almost 20 years on IT, I personally have never worked for or with a company that did not rely on AD in some way.

Same with datacenters large and small, on premise or in the cloud. They all at their core are integrated into AD.

Ask yourself this. The next time you log into work, at the office or virtually, what are you logging into? What behind the scenes is authenticating and controlling your network access levels throughout the company network? How is the company segmenting data to make sure specific end users can only access specific data sets like payroll, HR, and other sensitive personal identifiable information?

EDIT: As to how they continue to profit, review their Client Access Licensing schemes. Long story short, every user, computer, service, or application using AD services needs a license.",3,0.57
2021-02-11 19:23:35,APXT - The Dark Horse SPAC,"To anyone looking for a great play that's been quietly flying under the radar, let me introduce you to one of the best SPACs this year that's barely being talked about.

Apex Technologies / AvePoint Inc.

In November of 2020 AvePoint, the largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider announced a $2B merger with Apex Technologies. The deal is expected to close this quarter and AvePoint will begin trading under the new ticker AVPT.

Why is this one of the most undervalued SPACs right now?

1.) All Star Leadership

Both Apex and AvePoint boast great leadership teams. At Apex, Jeff Epstein (lol), serves as the co-CEO and CFO. Jeff has held board/executive positions at companies such as Oracle, Twilio, Nielsen, Booking Holdings among others. The other co-CEO, Brad Koenig has served as the Global Head of Technology Investment Banking at Goldman Sachs for 15+ years and has served clients such as Dell, eBay, Microsoft, SAP, Veritas, Oracle in advisory capacities. Both Jeff and Brad will join the board of AvePoint once the merger goes through.

The current CEO of AvePoint Tianyi Jang, who's 23 years in the industry include positions at Deutsche, Lehman Brothers, and Citadel will remain as the CEO. The rest of the executive team boast past positions at companies such as Deloitte, Johnson & Johnson, Verizon, Merril Lynch and many others.

2.) Total Addressable Market

We all know how huge cloud computing is and will continue to be through the future. This is no new news. AvePoint estimates their TAM to grow to over $33B by 2022. As a strategic cloud partner of Microsoft and a 5x Global Partner of the Year Recipient, they're very well positioned to grow along side Microsoft and the cloud computing space as a whole. This growth is only being accelerated by the pandemic.

[https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/tmt/library/covid19-cloud-infrastructure.html](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/tmt/library/covid19-cloud-infrastructure.html)

This partnership also allows a large competitive advantage as AvePoint offers the only full suite of SaaS solutions to migrate, manage, and secure data in Microsoft 365. Within the 7mm cloud users, previously mentioned there's some blockbuster Fortune 500 companies relying on AvePoint's technology everyday.

3.) Financials and Growth

Full Year Total Revenue for 2020 closed somewhere between $148M and $151M, up 29% year over Year. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Short Term Investments total approximately $70M as of December 30, 2020 with a \~14% EBIT margin. The company also remains completely debt-free.

With an additional $252mm in cash on its balance sheet from the transaction, there will be plenty of room to grow. Some of the avenues AvePoint plans attacking include; selling more to existing customers, increasing SMB footprint, capturing a larger share of the Microsoft Cloud Customer Base (currently only 3% with no meaningful competition in the space), and expanding target industry focus and international targets.

Been holding 200 shares since late November and am shocked this merger isn't getting more attention. In the year of the SPAC, this one stands out as one of the best. I see at as a great simultaneous growth and value play and wanted to share. Cheers.

How has that turned out?,"So far I'm going with Jeff Bezos' investing philosophy he outlined in one of his interviews. To just pick a bunch of high risk, high reward long term opportunities, and invest in all of them. If any one or multiple of them pan out, then it'll easily make up for the losers.

So far I've decided to just completely ignored index funds. Instead I'm just DCAing into whatever I find has huge long term potential based off of what reddit, youtube, motley fool or ARK has hyped up. 80% of my portfolio is in BTC, ETH, TSLA, SQ, LMND, DKNG, uranium stocks, and ARK ETFs.  I'm planning on adding solar and marijuana ETFs.

I've also decided not to sell a single stock no matter what happens, until I have enough to just put everything on VT/VTI and live off of that.

2021-02-12 10:08:51,The incentive to short TSLA is just massive at this point,"Ok guys, let's throw away the year-old arguments about valuations and  modelling and how TSLA's price is 10-20x what it should be even not  accounting for all the competition that it might have in the future.

At this point the only key measure to look at here is **market cap:**  we are looking at a $768B company, almost $1T. In case you haven't noticed, there aren't a lot of companies thare are worth significantly    more than that. Only  AAPL, MSFT, AMZN and Saudi Aramco thare are worth  more than double the price of TSLA, and they are all cash cows with massive amounts of actual real profits and fat margins, something that  Elon Musk doesn't have.

Even if TSLA stock rallied heavilyin the next months, it could as well double and go into the same league as those blue chips, but **REALISTICALLY,  it's not a 10 bagger potential ANYMORE: do you actually believe that  there would be LITERALLY TRILLIONS of dollars flowing into this stock?** Because to increase its price we need those numbers at this point.

Really  think about the people that could buy TSLA at this point, basically  everybody knows it's a massive bubble, and it's much easier to justify  taking  that massive risk if you know you could be in for a multibagger  upside wise, but  it's not easy given the relatively small upside of  today.

Having said all that,  there needs to be a catalyst. In the next few years, as competiton in  EV and autonomus driving space starts to thicken, we  might  finally see  a meltdown ...

**What do you guys think about this?**  I might be wrong and many hedge fund legends  have  lost billions  shorting this stuff, but at this point the poop smell is just too much.  Burry shorted this a couple of months back, he  predicted  2008, he  predicted Game Stop, he might be right on this  too.

The  other interesting point is that if TSLA falls, it might take  down the  entire market with it, or at least a good portion of the  NASDAQ",32,0.73

2021-02-09 19:38:11,Selling Puts to Generate Yield in this Bubbly Market. Talk me out of it!,"Market feels a little frothy and I'm moving to cash. That said I still want to generate income on the idle cash in excess of money market rates (nil). I don't want to touch bonds as rising interest rates will crush long durations bonds and short term bonds are also generating nil returns. Looking for suggestions but am leaning towards selling puts.

My thought is to sell July 2021 puts on AVGO, MSFT, AAPL, TSM. Setting strikes for 25-35% discounts on these stocks would get you a rough return of 3-4% annualized. Nothing spectacular but beats money markets. In the event the market crashes before July, I would be happy to buy any of these stocks at the discount.

Let me know if you have better suggestions for names to sell puts on (without excessive risk) or other strategies to generate yield. I'm not inclined to buy high dividend yield stocks as those will still get dragged down in a market correction and then you are stuck holding them until they recover. I'd rather generate yield now while remaining liquid so I'm in a position to bottom feed after a correction.",36,0.92

2021-02-28 00:05:21,Why Forward and TTM PE ratios have become increasingly irrelevant in today's environment," 

**Forward PE ratios are not real-** I'll start with forward PE because it is one of the most frustrating ratios. When you look at forward snp500 PE ratios on Yahoo finance or Macrotrends, you are comparing actual forward earnings, to estimated forward earnings. Here is a fun statistic, 80% of snp500 companies beat q4 2020 earnings. Let me emphasize this, \*\*forward earnings are always wrong\*\*. The deviation varies, but it is not the correct number. In this market condition, we are clearly in a phase where the market is pricing higher than expected 2021 earnings. This may be because of a faster than expected vaccine, more than expected stimulus, or maybe just irrationality… but it is expecting higher earnings. So when you are comparing historical forward PE to current, it’s not correct.

**Lower interest rates**\- Yes, this is an obvious narrative that has been pushed by the bulls for months now, but it has some truth to it. Lower interest rates mean a lot of things for companies. They can take on new debt or refinance current debt for lower interest rates, which means more money to invest in themselves for growth, or return more cash flow back to shareholders. Lower interest rates also have an effect on buy and sell-side analyst price targets. When modeling a price target, many analysts use discounted cash flow models or equity risk premiums to discount forward earnings to a present value. When interest rates are lower, the risk-free rate is, obviously, lower, which equates to a lower equity risk premium, hence, a higher price target. What else do higher interest rates mean? More spending from the average consumer. More debt is taken out- which is seen by historically high inflation-adjusted margin in stocks and record new home sales - which leads to more spending, which trickles down to the bottom line for snp500 companies, making trailing twelve-month earnings pretty irrelevant. If comparing historical pe ratios was a science experiment then the price would be a plant, sunlight would be earnings. We would be comparing the growth of plants v sunlight. In this experiment, we would want to keep all other factors constant, like room temperature, time spent exposed to sunlight, amount of soil, etc. But in our funky, weird, irrational, science experiment we are changing the amount of soil (interest rates), and here is the funniest part, people call it investing.

**The makeup of the snp500 companies**\- Another good reason historical PE ratios really mean nothing is that the quality of earnings has been pretty dramatically increasing. Over the past 7 years, the FANG % share of the snp500 market cap has gone from about 3.5% to around 12%, adding about a 1.7 forward earnings difference attributable to the FANG names. But, even this does not tell the full story. A significant makeup of the snp500 market cap is high growth names- relative to the snp500 earnings growth- not mentioned in that last example. Examples are Tesla, Amazon, Visa, Disney, Nvidia, Mastercard, Paypal, etc… It’s very easy to justify the snp500’s rather rapid rise of P/E ratio over the last decade by just the quality of earnings. These large-cap companies are taking away business from small, not snp500 companies. Which is a large factor in why the economy suffered in 2020 but Q4 2020 earnings were positive Y/Y. Another key point is that P/E ratios do not tell the full story for many companies. Amazon trades at a 90 PE, Tesla trades at a 1000 PE, Nvidia trades at 70 PE, NFLX 80, PYPL 70. Why? Because they have pretty significant 5-year earnings growth rates.

**The rise of intangibles**\- Companies are increasingly being valued by assets not realized by GAAP metrics. Intangible assets are one of the reasons price to book value has been a horrible performer the past 10 years. Companies are increasingly spending money on certain technologies that are producing 0 cash flows but will produce serious amounts of cash flow in the future. Let me give a good example. Tesla CEO Elon Musk stated on the 2020 Q4 earnings call “We are in preliminary talks to license autopilot”. Currently, autopilot is a free option producing 0 cash flow but has required significant CAPEX to create. We know this is an asset to Tesla and will create cash flow into the future. Autopilot, arguably, is producing earnings for the company right now, since it’s a selling point on their main products. But this does not show up on any income statement or balance sheet. This is simply an example to show how GAAP metrics do not do justice to many companies. An example like this can be pulled out of almost any snp500 company. 

**Stock buybacks-** SNP500 company’s buybacks basically fell through the floor in 2020. There is a quite obvious reason why this happened, a ton of uncertainty in the economy so companies temporarily suspended stock buybacks. As we all know, stock buybacks artificially increase EPS since the company is retiring shares, just like secondaries artificially decrease EPS since it’s dilutionary. Stock buybacks are expected to not only pick up in 2021 but expected to accelerate to historical highs. Making TTM PE ratio's not telling the full story on stock prices.

**PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS-** This statement is a disclaimer on almost every, 10k, 10q, institutional note, and blog post. But investors seem to take that philosophy and throw it out the window when it comes to price ratios. If you had looked at historical earnings ratios in May 2009, you would have sold all your stocks and crawled under a rock. Since then we have missed the greatest bull market in history. If you would have looked at historical PE’s in 2014, you would have said to yourself, the market is overvalued, I will sell and wait for a dip. Well, in that time, you would have to wait 4 years for a 20% decline and get this, you would be paying a 40% premium, not including dividends gained. A 20 PE ratio today does not mean it won't be 30 in the future. 

**A number without context should mean 0 to you-** One of the most well-known philosophies in investing is to not chase yield. A higher yield almost always means higher risk. If it didn’t, everyone would be buying 10% dividend-yielding stocks, not realizing earnings have a higher risk of falling, or maybe debt payments are starting to drown the company, etc. And the same vice versa, nobody is selling Microsoft because it is paying a lower dividend relative to the snp500. MSFT is just a higher quality company with a lower payout ratio. This logic should be applied to PE ratios as well. A low PE ratio should almost be alarming. Stocks like Walgreens or Abbvie trade around 10x forward earnings while Microsoft and Apple trade at around 30x forward earnings.

Revenue for commercial PCs cratered 22% months after support for Windows 7 ended and the coronavirus pandemic took hold; the category had surged last year, making outperformance this year more difficult.

2021-02-23 05:48:35,"A ""Stocks for Inflation"" ETF and value factor discussion","I think that two Fidelity ETFs deserve more attention.  Each is under 5 years old with an ER of 0.29%, each had a regularly scheduled rebalance just a day ago (so it's a good time to evaluate holdings), and each makes novel contributions to the factor ETF space.

&#x200B;

1. **FCPI, Fidelity Stocks for Inflation ETF:** [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FCPI](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FCPI)

Methodology here: [https://research2.fidelity.com/pi/Content/Documents/RebalanceSchedulesPDFs/Fidelity%20Stocks%20For%20Inflation%20Factor%20Index%20Methodology.pdf](https://research2.fidelity.com/pi/Content/Documents/RebalanceSchedulesPDFs/Fidelity%20Stocks%20For%20Inflation%20Factor%20Index%20Methodology.pdf)

Described on page 5 of the methods doc, the ETF tracks an index that screens for value, quality, and momentum of stocks (a set of 11 total metrics, which I like for inflation protection due to the emphasis on free cash flow).  However, it also slightly biases sector weights (5% each) depending on historical correlation of sector performance with inflation.  So you get more weight on commodities-centric stocks, fewer tech and consumer discretionary stocks, etc (see page 7 of methods).  Its performance in the past year hasn't been amazing (it has been like VTV), but, inflation concerns did not really ramp up until very recently.  Also, the ETF index was reconstituted effective Monday, February 22 (see methods).  So if it's going to outperform a total market ETF, it's set up for it right now.  This is a small ETF by AUM and volume, so keep an eye on bid/ask spreads if you're dipping into it, but man, super appealing right now!

Having a look inside, you need to examine the daily holdings document since it was rebalanced more recently than the end-of-January summary holdings.  That's here: [http://fundresearch.fidelity.com/prospectus/eproredirect?clientId=Fidelity&applicationId=ETF&securityId=316092386&securityIdType=CUSIP&critical=N](http://fundresearch.fidelity.com/prospectus/eproredirect?clientId=Fidelity&applicationId=ETF&securityId=316092386&securityIdType=CUSIP&critical=N) .  Top 10 holdings currently include:

AAPL, MSFT, EQT, WMB, EXP, NEM, CC, PG, GOOGL, PM.  Thus, it's heavy on free-cash-flow tech, oil/gas, materials, and consumer staples.

&#x200B;

2. **FVAL, Fidelity Value Factor ETF**: [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL)

Methodology here: [https://research2.fidelity.com/pi/Content/Documents/RebalanceSchedulesPDFs/FMR\_US\_Value\_Focus\_Methodology\_publicFNL.pdf](https://research2.fidelity.com/pi/Content/Documents/RebalanceSchedulesPDFs/FMR_US_Value_Focus_Methodology_publicFNL.pdf)

Many ""value factor"" ETFs have a near-exclusive focus on price/book ratio and earnings (or sales) to price.  This one is different in that is specifically calls out free cash flow yield and earnings to enterprise value metrics, which are also metrics that DSTL (the ""Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF"", another modern value/quality ETF @ [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl)) weights highly.  In fact, these value metrics are also used as the ""value"" metrics for FCPI. FVAL is not a simple ""value or growth"" classifier like some S&P or CRSP value/growth factor ETFs.  It has consistently outperformed Vanguard's value ETF, VTV, probably as a result of using methods that can better reflect the effects of intangible value.  It was also rebalanced effective Monday, Feb. 22.  I think that this is the sort of ETF that may also outperform the market if meme growth tech stocks stagnate or there is mild inflation.

Its top holdings do include free-cash-flow tech starting with S&P 500 stalwarts AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL and FB.  Many ""value"" ETFs will not be holding those tech leaders!  But after that that, FVAL takes a bit of a turn; one thing you won't find in either FVAL or FCPI is Tesla.  But FVAL does have classic value stocks such as Berkshire Hathaway and JNJ in its top 10.

Microsoft(MFST) rose 12 points to $226 on news of its collaboration with GM for autonomous vehicles. Alphabet (GOOGL), added 150 to close at $1893; analysts realizing that their Waymo unit was way more valuable. Amazon(AMZN), no slouch, added 174 points closing at $3,293.

The indices reflected the tech dominance. The DJIA rose just 183 or 0.6% to 30,997, the S&P gained 1.9% to 3,841 but the tech heavy NASDAQ composite jumped 4.2% to 13,543, its biggest gain since the week ended Nov 6th.

The post-election rally of cyclical, value and small cap stocks was built on stimulus hopes and the reflation trade from the Blue sweep; it didn't see as much participation from big tech. When reality sank in that the massive stimulus bill was not going to be easily passed in the senate, the cyclical rally hit a pause -- suddenly tech was looking cheap, and NFLS’s earnings post market on Tuesday lit the fire. Interest rates too held steady – the 10 year closed around 1.10 and didn’t douse the fire.

**What lies ahead?** 

Next week is a very busy week with 20% of the S&P expected to report earnings. I do expect the tech rally to continue, though not at the same blistering pace; many will sell on news and take profits. I own all the FAAMNG’s and will sell small portions to book some profits. However, they remain a fairly large part of my portfolio and barring anti-trust government action, I don’t see any secular threats. 

I’m still bullish on cyclicals, value and small caps. I bought Toyota Motors, (TM), General Motors (GM) and Ford (F), besides increasing positions in US Foods (USFD) and Performance Group (PFGC). The autos deserve some of Tesla’s sunshine - sure they’re far behind in technology and branding but the gap is too wide and presents opportunity. I like USFD and PFGC, they’re food distributors and post vaccination and lifting of lockdowns – people will release their pent up demand for eating out.

What is the point of this in comparison with holding 1-3 ETFs like VTI, SnP500, QQQ, ARK, ICLN and so on with little to no overlap? I compared performance and its very similar, those companies don't deflect from market performance that much, if at all. You practically trade 0-2%/year for broader diversification.

I am asking because I am on a verge of investing in individual stocks my self but my take on it is different and I want to double check.

My Strategy - For past 4 months I pumped 2k every 2 weeks into Vanguard FTSE AW (80%) + Vanguard FTSE EM (20%) (EU citizen) as a stable base. Additionally I bought 3k worth of AMD at dip of 59, because I follow this this industry and AMD is what practically got me into investing. I use and believe in their products, love range of markets they appear on and upcoming product lines indicates, that upward trend is going to continue. But.. even tho its improving, their debt to assets ratio is quite high and p/e indicates overvaluation, so I am planing to sell at 90 or day before products launch (4th of November). Sorry for OT. Lets get back on track..

I want to hold ETF to single stock ratio of 75/25 % and looking for my next move (VRTX or FSLY after dip,,DOYU, BABA..?), but why chose mildly growing stock that doesn't deflect from market trend? Am I wrong to assume that? Thanks for your reactions..",635,0.92

Out of the four of them, Microsoft looks like the most solid buy, and not just because they’re the only American company aside from J&J to have a AAA credit rating.

Apple is a victim of its own success. The iPhone X will reportedly be discontinued due to it’s unjustifiably large thousand dollar+ price tag and lagging sales. Which is why the gold iPhone X was never introduced and the Product Red iPhone 8 is being promoted instead. Apple has invented nothing impressive after Jobs’ passing. The Apple Watch is a flop with apps being removed including Instagram, Amazon, Google Maps, EBay, Slack, and more, most likely due to a lack of use. Now the flip side to the argument as to why you should invest in AAPL is that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is invested in Apple, and as of this writing AAPL is actually their largest holding. Buffett’s reasoning because Apple has a large “moat” meaning that consumer loyalty to the brand is super impressive. But with HomePod completely missing the targets and being a thorough disappointment with an inept Siri and again super high price tag, Apple is pushing the limits on what it can get away with. Maybe the Oracle of Omaha sees something I don’t, but when I want to see the cutting edge in technology I go to the Microsoft Store to test out Hololens, not see another iteration of the iPad Pro which now supports Pencil.

Google is a mixed bag with awesome strengths as well as warning signs it may just be a follower in the industry, and not a good one at that. The strengths of Google are that it still has a monopoly on search, its maps apps (Maps, Waze, Earth) are unrivaled, and it is dominating the classroom with its free online productivity suite of Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Not to mention the fact that YouTube is unrivaled, Google Chrome is unrivaled, and Android is unrivaled when it comes to an iOS alternative. The weaknesses of Google is that they sometimes have no idea what they are doing and fail spectacularly. Google Glass was creepy. Google Plus was lame. Google Nexus went nowhere. And even though Android is breaking record numbers as the world’s most popular OS, Google still clings to their vision of a webpage-centric OS in their flailing ChromeOS. So flailing in fact that they had to suck some energy from Android and make Android apps compatible with ChromeOS.

Amazon is a company I hate with a passion. They abuse their warehouse workers, Jeff Bezos is the richest person on the planet yet he refuses to donate to charity nor conduct interviews except for maybe one by his brother, and this hunger games Amazon is having cities do to impress them for a second headquarters is just messed up and totally fake (Boston is still in the running and they explicitly said they’re offering jack shit with regard to tax breaks). Plus reports are coming in that Whole Foods is being ruined from within: upper management has left, suppliers have left after fees were increased, produce is lagging in quality for the first time, stores are forced to become more centralized and less locally involved, and shelves are deliberately being left empty because of a new system of stocking which may be more efficient but looks awful. Can’t wait for Amazon to fail on this one just like they did with their Fire Phone.

Microsoft is by far the most impressive tech company on this list. Their hardware is top notch, making them safe in an era where companies who make their money on data, like Facebook and Google, are caught in the crosshairs of public perception and backlash. Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella is a thoroughly impressive individual who has worked at Microsoft for decades, is humble as well as decisive, and seems to be ready to cut tech that isn’t working for the company while fostering growth and innovation for sectors of the company that have potential or are currently working well. Microsoft Stores are opening up and introducing people to innovative tech straight from the company itself.

In summary I’d say that Microsoft is going to continue to trend upwards, Google’s fate is in their own hands, Apple is not going anywhere better, and Amazon will continue to slide. And when it comes to long term success, I’m more likely to invest in tech companies that do hardware and have a physical presence like their own stores (Microsoft, Apple) than companies who rely totally on reputation (Amazon, Google save for Nest and Pixel).",38,0.54

2020-12-21 04:10:51,Comparing YHOO AND TSLA,"Hi all

So now that TSLA is in the S&P let’s compare 

YHOO(1999) was part of the dotcom bubble, a bubble fuelled by the (in hindsight) mostly accurate assumptions that (a) cost of internet is going down (b) user count is going up (c) margins for profit are extremely good (d) economy of scale on the net is infinite. This lead to the assumption that YHOO and its ilk could potentially have a user base of [the world] and hence reap profits from 7bn users for essentially no cost of revenue. (900 PE valuation)

TSLA(2020) is part of the EV/disruptive tech bubble, a bubble fuelled by the speculation that growth of these disruptive industries can in some unspecified way achieve global dominance over existing market leader under the changing climate of (e)environmental policy, (f)government attitudes, and (g)exponential technical development. Unfortunately unlike YHOO it has a high base cost of revenue (manufacturing, research, retooling) and may run into the diseconomies of scale barrier that stymied the growth of many other physical goods companies due to a inherently high retail value of goods sold being a barrier to entry for new users. Arguably its one standout feature is (h)vertical integration something that has historically been successful during the early 1900s seen most prominently in the Trust monopolies (1300PE)

While YHOO and it’s Ilk fell precipitously other new companies that survived the tech bubble collapse (GOOGL, AMZN, FB, MSFT, AAPL, BABA) actually achieved the stated goal of (a-d) and became the largest market leaders seen since The AT&T and early 19th century Trust monopolies.

Are we looking at the next wave of companies coming into existence meeting the e-h criteria that will take over the world? Or is TSLA another canary set to die in the coal mine without any impact.

Discuss!

Edit : added (h) to TSLA for vertical integration,

2020-09-15 20:22:41,Microsoft announces quarterly dividend increase,"[https://news.microsoft.com/2020/09/15/microsoft-announces-quarterly-dividend-increase-3/](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/09/15/microsoft-announces-quarterly-dividend-increase-3/)

Microsoft Corp. on Tuesday \[after-hours\] announced that its board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.56 per share, reflecting a five cent or 10% increase over the previous quarter’s dividend. The dividend is payable Dec. 10, 2020, to shareholders of record on Nov. 19, 2020.",812,0.96
2020-11-14 19:00:02,"How high can PLTR go? Or put more succinctly, how big is the market that PLTR is playing in?","I bought PLTR at around $10 seeing some momentum in that stock and already gained around 50%.

When I bought it I just saw that it provides software for governments and allows patterns within datasets etc.

Basically I have read some articles and understood horse shit. Big data??

I have seen that they have made a contract with an oil company which will help that oil company save around $1B.

I know that PLTR is being extensively supported by the US govt and they won't enter the Chinese market, which means this company is never going bankrupt.

And knowing Peter Thiel, this could be something huge.

All I want to understand from you guys is how big a market PLTR is actually playing in? Which other companies do you think will eat PLTRs lunch(MSFT and AMZN seem very likely)?

And if PLTR actually manages to pull off its game, how could it be impacting our lives?

I kinda know what you guys will say, take profit and to never invest in something I don't understand, but please avoid this kinds of answers, because I know that.😅",113,0.88
2019-07-19 09:29:17,What is going on with MSFT?,"I was surprised when it only went up only 2% after hours yesterday.

Shouldn't it be much much higher?

2021-01-23 17:05:04,Why would you sell covered calls on a highly volatile stock that you want to hold long term? Aren't you betting against your own intuition and risking your position for pennies on the dollar?,"Hello, I recently funded an account with a new brokerage to start messing around with options. I have 250k MSFT in my main portfolio at a brokerage I'm not approved to trade options with yet. I've decided to use PLTR to test the waters with skimming premiums before I employ the strategy on my main.

From what I can tell, selling a covered call is a bearish play against the underlying. I bought 200 shares of PLTR, with which to sell covered calls. I sold 2 calls at .59 at a strike price of 40 expiring 2/19. My plan is to skim premiums from highly OTM options. Isn't this quite... stupid, for lack of a better word? The company has the three most important dates since it DPO'd all coming before expiration, implying possibility of high volatility. It jumped 25% yesterday. I realize I didn't pick an optimal call to sell. Risking 200 shares of a company I believe in for $.59*200 seems silly to me. If I sell at 45 I'll be hit with hundreds in taxes to jump back in. I'm also down a lot currently because the stock did just what I thought it would (went up).

Is there something I'm missing? Should you only ever be selling covered calls on relatively static companies like MSFT? Or did I simply create a shitty contract?

Finally, my gut reaction because I'm so bullish is to buy 100 shares at open on Monday. Is this a good idea for hedging against a stock you're bullish on that's rocketing toward your strike price? I can't sell cash-secured puts as all of my shares are locked up in the aforementioned covered calls.

2020-11-13 07:48:43,First Quarter Results: 3 months into the /r/investing underrated stock survey and overall you're up 10-11%,"Building on a previous post ([http://redd.it/i2thge/](http://redd.it/i2thge/)) asking the community to pick underrated stocks, I've aggregated the results after one quarter has passed.  See below for takeaways after \~3 months.

Note: you can view a visual version here: [https://i.imgur.com/sRrYmmy.png](https://i.imgur.com/sRrYmmy.png)

Key takeaways:

* Overall average return of 9.9%, with an equal weighted return of 11%. If you picked a stock from this list at random, you would have a 44% chance of a return greater than 10%
* Highest returning pick: Nio Inc (NIO) at 260% flagged by /u/Carrera_GT, /u/makesalotofmoney, /u/Charlie_Brown364
* If you invested in the top 5 most upvoted stocks (NET, CRSP, STNE, NVDA, NOK), you would have seen a return of 12.7%
* If you invested in the top 5 most controversial stocks (TSLA, WD, AMD, LMND, UBER), you would have seen a return of 18.6%
* If you had invested in the stocks with greater than 10% return in the first 30 days, your total return would be 27.4%

2021-01-26 13:34:07,What is a good alpha for a Long/Short Tech portfolio?,"I am a hedge fund analyst and I had to maintain a simulation portfolio since I came in in early june (can’t handle real money yet).

Excluding after-hours today (I have MSFT), I ended today with a 43.6% return. In the same period, the Nasdaq Comp. yielded 38.8%, and the NDX 37.3%. This means an Alpha of 4.8% vs Comp., 6.3% vs NDX.

My main goals were finding good picks with some relatively “unknown/not that popular” and having volatility at a minimum (on avg. around 2-3%). The simulation (investopedia) started with 100K. 

Is this good for a first-time simulation portfolio/active portfolio management?

I know it isn’t real money and that is a downside since the emotional factor isn’t the same.

Any tips to enhance this return will be greatly appreciated too!",5,0.78

I'm an engineer at Microsoft and have over $80k in Microsoft stock. I sold the first lot of long term stock (\~$40k) because I want to diversify and have already doubled my money. It think it will take a long time for MSFT to double again. I'm very bullish on PLTR and they've constantly been securing large gov't contracts and there's really no competition to the Foundry technology because it's so advanced.

2020-12-08 13:50:03,The stages of index investing,"These stages are not my own. I just uncovered them however they described my experience to investing to a tee. So I thought I’d share. 


https://www.fiphysician.com/the-education-of-an-index-investor-an-future-book-by-rick-ferri/

1: Born in darkness; When I first started off I didn’t really know much. I invested heavily into MSFT and less so into JPM because well, I knew them. Ngl I got pretty good returns. Until bitcoin started to gain in popularity and I made a lot of money with that thankfully. However the more money I had I the more stressed I got, that’s when I learned about diversification and index funds. Which is a segue into...

2: Finds Indexing enlightenment; After I learned about index funds, I invested heavily into them. They seemed so easy and great. 

3: Over-complicates everything; I found these index funds so nifty that I probably had upwards of 20 different index funds at one point, I was after the perfect portfolio of perfectly weighted small cap value, REITs, mid caps, and you name it. It then began to be very difficult to track and rebalance my allocations. This lead to....

4: Embraces simplicity; now I realize I was just shooting myself in the foot having so many indexes and ETFs. I’m slowly working on moving into just 7 funds (VOO, IJH, IJR, VNQ, VXUS, VNQI and AGG). I’m sure one day I’ll narrow it down even more, I’ll probably eliminate IJH and add it to VOO, or I’ll eliminate VNQI and add it to VXUS. 

I’m not gonna lie, it’s been hard simplifying down. It’s stressful selling things I’ve become accustomed to having while also managing tax implications. 

My opinion to everyone else who hasn’t hit stage 4 yet; good luck.",32,0.82
2021-01-09 06:24:34,The future of the big 5 US tech companies,"I read an article a while ago, that the big 5 tech companies GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, FB and AAPL fear regulations of data protection and security. They all gather big data and are exposed to regulations of the whole world through their global activities.

Europe already set the path for more regulations with GDPR and I believe it will extend. Companies will be forced to monitor and report more details to their activities and audits will cost them millions in administration.

The US, after the whole disaster going on with Trump, his followers and whatever other groups spreading misinformation, will for sure consider further regulations in the next 2 years.

I work in finance, and I see what administrative overhead regulations create. They make development expensive and slow. So I wonder if the big 5 will remain being longterm sure return investments or if this could be the beginning of a slow decline.

What are your thoughts on that?",5,0.65
2021-01-11 08:01:16,Tesla (again),"Let's brainstorm this a little bit.  I'm sure most of you saw that snippet from 60 minutes (posted on WSB recently), saying, ""Amazon would have to sell every book being sold in the world today to justify its stock price."" That was way back in the late 1990s when Amazon was just an on-line book store. 

Someone else said, ""That's Tesla today."" 

I'd like to know how. 

Amazon had a clear path to expand from selling books, to household gadgets, to literally everything and anything sold by anyone anywhere. Including things that didn't exist in the 1990s, like AWS cloud services (that \*should\* have gone to someone like Akamai or CSCO or MSFT, or Oracle or even freaking WalMart had a better information system infrastructure than Amazon had in the 1990s.)  Amazon dominating that segment was just a fluke. And currently the lion's share of its revenue too.

Also, I wanted an electric car but didn't want Tesla's goofy iPad-style interface system, among other things, so I took an old sports car and built my own EV. Guess what? EV's are not hard. Sure, mine is definitely not more efficient than a Tesla (or Bolt, or etc.) but I learned something important -- replacing the drivetrain and installing batteries was the easy part (granted, I have some electrical engineering experience -- but not much). Literally everything else about building a car was way, way, WAY harder. Companies like Ford, GM, Toyota, VW, etc. can \*easily\* outbuild Tesla, and highly efficient, high-torque electric motors and solid state batteries appear to be on their way to commodity status. 

Solar Panels, self-driving capability, yada, yada... I don't see how these can possibly match the scale of what Amazon did. Grid energy storage, merging with Space-X and using Starlink's Skynet as part of the self-driving hive-mind... maybe? 

What else could there be? Fully autonomous, self-managing houses? Is Tesla going to start selling phones that use Starlink, to fulfill the space Iridium tried to back in the 90's? 

Help me understand how TSLA \*might\* live-up to its current stock price. I want to believe, but currently, I'm just not seeing it.",0,0.5
2020-10-16 12:47:41,What is the truth behind the statement that very few people are able to beat the market?,"Because Reddit seems to be good at picking out winners not only in the short term, but in 4-5 year time spans as well… I’ve seen a lot of topics from 2016-2017 where people were bullish on companies like AMD (40x), MSFT (4x), NVDA (20x), TSLA (9x). Some were bullish on failures like GE, and Intel but even if you picked those as well, you still would’ve been up tremendously over the market.

The stocks that Reddit were hyping 4-5 months ago and are still hyping up today, NET (1.8x), DKNG (2.5x), SQ (3x), ARKK (2x) have also done very well… And it’s not like these are short term stocks either. They all have huge growth opportunities 5-10 years down the line.

In contrast on average it takes 7 years for an S&P 500 ETF to 2x. Statistically, it would take 7+ years for my investment in VTI to reach the same % gains as the investment I made in DKNG 5 months ago. Furthermore you’d have to wait 20+ years just for VOO and VTI to reach 8x valuations. Most of us would be in our late 40s, or early 50s by then.

As a young person I’d rather take a medium risk, high reward opportunity, than a very-low risk low-reward opportunity.

And yet over and over again, we’re told that very few people are able to beat the market, and you’re better off just dumping everything into an S&P 500 index fund and holding. But the more I lurk on this subreddit and various other investing communities, the more I question that statement.

I’m thinking many people underperform the market because they make emotional decisions. They try to time the market, sell innovative companies for a measly 1.5x gain only to buy back again at a higher price due to fomo, liquidate everything on the slightest hint of bad news and so forth. Just like the statistic that got posted, where the Magellan Fund averaged 20% / year over 10 years, but the people who bought into the fund actually had a net negative. And overall there are far more investors like that in general rather than people who know to just buy and hold onto a stock with long term prospects.",218,0.89

2020-12-15 07:47:42,Short Term Profit Taking Considerations,"Profit taking. You're up a large percentage and you're afraid that the market will take your profits away as it's done many times. You're also afraid of selling too early and watching your position rise shortly afterwards, like it's done many times. How can you decide whether to sell or hold? Well, here are **a few things to think about.**

1- Selling on the news- Some good news comes out for your position and your stock pops 6 percent in the premarket. Now you should consider selling. Why? Look at a recent examples- Boeing's positive 737 Max news on Nov 18th. There was a large buildup in price in the days prior. (buying the rumour) The stock opened much higher at 223 and ended the session around 203. Example 2- Pfizer's positive vaccine news yesterday. The market sold the covid recovery stocks on the news. Cruises, airlines, and hotels all got rocked.

2- When your position has run up an insane amount in a very short amount of time and may be due for a pullback. Example- snowflake- in 4 days this stock went from 280 to 429. Now it's trading at about 317 a few days later. Any big moves like this should be viewed with suspicion. Example 2- XPEV- After nearly doubling in about 3 trading sessions, the stock plummeted from 74.49 to a low of 42.84 over the next 11 trading sessions. Example 2- Big Tech's massive rally from March to September. It eventually got too hot and [corrected.](https://corrected.It) It's December now and MSFT AAPL AMZN and others still haven't recovered. (google is an exception).

Also note that big upward swings attract the attention of short sellers (think Citron and PLTr) and momentum traders just looking to pump and dump. When this happens, don't think of it as an investment. You should be pumping and dumping too. The bigger the top, the bigger the drop.

3- Going into earnings or some big event that could have a big effect, especially highly anticipated ones and ones that could possibly go wrong. Example- (SPCE) Virgin Galactic's failed space mission. It dropped about 16% or something afterwards.

4- When the uptrend in your position breaks. (technical analysis) Example- NIO- The uptrend broke around the 50 dollar mark. This happened a couple of days after the high of 57. About a week later, it reached its low of 38.43.

5-When your position changes to a consolidation period. (technical analysis) Example- Tesla- spent about 2.5 months consolidating from September to mid November. You would have been better off taking profits at a higher level of the range and either getting back in when Tesla broke out again, or buying back in at a low level of the range and just holding and waiting (for patient people) Example 2- Amazon and MSFT are still consolidating since September.

6-Consider selling when Goldman Sach's upgrades a stock.

**Please note**\- I understand that many of the buy and hold investors here will be offended. But I also know that profit taking is something that many people here are interested in doing better. As I am.

With profit taking, there may also a time to get back in. Example- if you got out of tesla during it's consolidation period, you would have rightly got back in when it broke out again.

With profit taking, you can try to get every dollar. But your focus should be on catching the big move. Worry more about catching the big move, rather than getting out at the very top. It's more efficient.

Obviously there are plenty of counter examples to what I've said. And I've cherry picked examples to express my point. However my point is that these are **things to consider** in profit taking, not any hard fast rules.

I'm not a professional and I don't have a lot of experience. I'm an amateur trader with a shorter term mindset who spends a decent amount of time trying to figure these things out.

There will still be many times when you sell too early or don't sell when you should. It's all part of the game. Don't beat yourself up too much and try to learn from it.

Good luck with your trading.",38,0.85
2021-01-13 12:55:38,Fiverr International Ltd (NYSE:FVRR)," 

Hello investors,

Today, I wanted to share my thoughts on a company called Fiverr. This is one of my favorite companies and I believe the growth potential is enormous. Full disclosure, I have a large portion of my portfolio invested in this stock, in the form of shares and options.

For those interested in the model, please fill out this form to be put on the email distribution list so it makes it easier to send the spreadsheets. Keep in mind the company is small so the model will be much simpler.

[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZ6J9pFUq3At2yncsQ\_L4XalvVEVa-BW2nbHR7-bJ9BRKplA/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&flr=0&gxids=7628&fbzx=4409293954243517011](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZ6J9pFUq3At2yncsQ_L4XalvVEVa-BW2nbHR7-bJ9BRKplA/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&flr=0&gxids=7628&fbzx=4409293954243517011)

Their business is not too difficult to understand. It operates a platform that allows freelancers to offer their digital services such as programming, marketing, brand designs, or video editing to start-ups or small businesses. It's basically the Amazon of digital services, as opposed to products.

Say you want to start a marketing company and need to design a logo. Instead of going to LinkedIn to post a job description for a 3-hour job, you can instead go to Fiverr platform and hire a designer to create a professional logo for you.

If the service is posted for $100, you pay $105 and the seller (the designer) will receive $80, Fiverr taking a total of $25 (5+20). This is a take rate of whooping 25%! (25/100). Their actual take rate for the twelve months ended in 9/30/2020 was 27%, up from 26.6% in 9/30/2019. Compare that to 3.24% monetization rate for Pinduoduo ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/jtn4ye/pinduoduo\_pdd\_11132020/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/jtn4ye/pinduoduo_pdd_11132020/)).

It wouldn't be hard to convince people that freelancing will become a growing part of our gig economy, just like Uber allowed non-taxi drivers to offer their services or Airbnb allowed non-hoteliers to offer their services. Fiverr is allowing those with the capacity and skills to offer their services for those who need them. And small companies don't need to hire a full-time web developer and pay for their insurance, medical benefits, etc. It's a win-win for both the buyers and sellers.

This all makes sense so far but how effective and popular is this idea really? Is there enough demand from both sides of the transaction (the buyers, aka small businesses, and the sellers, aka freelancers) for this company to grow?

After going through the following charts, I felt more comfortable with how successful this platform is. It basically proves this model works extremely well.

For pictures, please refer to the original post as it doesn't allow me to post pictures here.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/kwplc0/fiverr\_international\_ltd\_nysefvrr\_the\_leading/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/kwplc0/fiverr_international_ltd_nysefvrr_the_leading/)

Additional lines of businesses

Operational results

📷📷

Not only the growing number of buyers is contributing to the top-line growth but also the spending per buyer growth is in effect compounding the revenue growth. This proves to show that each buyer is more than satisfied for a service he/she purchased and therefore, each one is spending more on the platform.

📷

This is probably the most impressive chart. The churn rate (the rate at which people cancel their subscriptions) is extremely low for a small tech company. Usually the churn rates are high for tech companies but this chart shows that the retention rate is enormous. Not only that, the new buyers are contributing larger portion of the total number of buyers on the platform, showing that the marketing team is doing something right.

📷

Now, without even using their service once, we know that something is working well for them with a high degree of conviction. It's hard to argue against their success up until this point.

All of these sound great and exciting, but the next part is the tricky part.

At what price can we get a share of this company? All company analyses should involve an assessment of the valuation.

I'll tell you upfront it's not cheap. And it shouldn't be since it's such a solid company with so much potential for growth. You have to pay a premium for really good companies, just like you have to pay extra to get those luxury handbags or watches.

The stock price closed at $254 on 1/13/2021, or $8.9B market cap.

Based on LTM sales, that's a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 55x. But for a small company like Fiverr, it's better to look at it from 2021 sales estimate standpoint, which yields 2021E P/S multiple of 33x assuming 50% revenue growth in 2021.

Compare that to 2021E 3.6x P/S for Amazon, 7x for Facebook, 5.5x for Google and 10.1x for MSFT. FVRR is trading at an extremely high multiple compared to the FANNG companies.

But those aren't really comparable because their market caps are too big. Thus we need to compare FVRR's 33x P/S with the below multiples.

📷

Looking at these numbers, FVRR still seems to be at the high end of the spectrum.

One thing to keep in mind is that FVRR has a high gross margin, which means for every $1 dollar the company makes, they keep 80 cents for themselves assuming 80% gross margin. Look at the below numbers.

📷

No wonder FVRR is trading at such a high multiple since their high gross margin allows them to have wider net margins later when they turn profitable.

Next is projecting out how the company would be valued if they hit certain financial milestones, such as 50% revenue growth. Below is my projection.

📷

By 2026, I would expect the company to triple its current valuation. However, this is assuming a very conservative scenario. Please remember that anyone can plug in whatever assumptions they want to make the projections rosier but the key aspect to remember is that the current valuation is high while the company is growing at a fast clip.

When you are trying to decide whether you should invest in the company because it is a great company but the valuation is too high, always remember this quote from Warren Buffett.

"" It's far **better to buy** a wonderful **company** at a **fair price than** a **fair company** at a wonderful **price**. ""

This means that it is better to buy a great company even if the valuation is too high than to buy a fair company at a great price. Now, be careful about the definition of valuation.

If the price paid is too high, then it will eat away your returns and it won't be worth it.

I always show people this graph of Microsoft during the tech boom. Yes, Microsoft was an amazing company in 1999 but look how many years it took for investors to breakeven in their stocks if they bought the shares at the top of the tech bubble.

📷

The point is that it's wise to buy a great company but the price has to be reasonable. Right now, at 33x 2021E P/S, I believe it is reasonable enough.

We may very well see a correction of more than 30% on the company, which will make it a great entry point. For anyone who is afraid of the height of valuation, then it would be wise to sit out on this or sell put options on the stock to collect the premium or buy back the stock when the price reaches your exercise price (more on this strategy to come in Options Trading Part IV). Regardless, the company will continue to grow in the future and over the next five years, the company will certainly be valued much higher than it is right now.

As always, please feel free to provide feedback! This is for educational purposes only and I would very much appreciate any ideas to make it more informative.

Thanks for reading everyone!",11,0.79

""The artificial intelligence software company C3.ai priced its initial public offering at $42 a share, above the recently increased range of $36 to $38. That wasn’t high enough. C3.ai shares opened for trading at $100 Wednesday morning and were up to $109 shortly after that, for a gain of 160% from the IPO price.

The company is selling 15.5 million shares in the offering, raising $651 million. At $109 a share, C3 has a market value of close to $12 billion on a fully diluted basis.

C3.ai will have about 109 million fully diluted shares outstanding after the offering and two concurrent private placements. Microsoft (MSFT) has agreed to buy $50 million of stock at the IPO price, while Spring Creek Capital, an affiliate of Koch Industries, has pledged to invest $100 million on the same basis.

A provider of artificial intelligence software to large enterprises, C3.ai was founded by built the long-time Silicon Valley enterprise software entrepreneur Tom Siebel.

For the April 2020 fiscal year, C3.ai had revenue of $156.7 million, up 71% from the previous year. But for the six months ended Oct. 31, growth slowed: Revenue for the period was $81.8 million, up just 10.9% from the comparable year earlier period.

2020-12-12 12:28:11,Categorizing the cloud market,"I am trying to classify the cloud market for DD and comparison. I am only interested in publicly traded companies in US. So far I have managed the following 

1. Content delivery network and Edge cloud - FSLY, NET, AKAM, RXT
2. Security - FEYE, FTNT, PANW, CRWD, OKTA, SPLK, ZS
3. Communication as a platform service - TWLO, RNG, KLR
4. Data analytics - SNOW, PLTR, MDB, NEWR, DT, DDOG, SUMO, DDOG
5. REIT - EQIX, DLR, CONE, QTX

I have left data storage and computing as these are mostly done by the big cloud players. Data storage has many players other than the big ones like BOX as well. 

I have left out the big cloud players like AMZN, GOOG, MSFT etc as well since they fall into more than one category and cloud is not their main business. 

I wanted to get some feedback. Any names that I should include. I am mostly looking at companies that are new even though some names like AKAM and RXT are old.

Edit: Merged CDN and edge cloud. Added cloud analytics and REIT. Thanks for the suggestions.",20,0.78
2021-01-25 00:25:07,"""Tourism Recovery Portfolio"": When to switch to what I actually want?","Hi,

starting in april I bought lots of stocks that were hard-hit by COVID (as I bet that we would get a vaccine eventually):

DAL

Boeing

Airbus

Sabre Corp

LUV

Marriott

MGM

and I'm currently wondering when to sell these and rebuild my portfolio with what I actually want.

As these are all cyclical tourism stocks (basically), the highs should generally be in August.

But since we will be fighting COVID for a good while longer, I guess it will take at least until Summer 2022 for them to regain their previous highs (hopefully)

These stocks are nowhere close to being recovered but I'm feeling FOMO as the stocks that I want to buy are just rising year after year (MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN basically)

Any opinion on this? What is your take, much appreciate

I also expect that the entire market will do a pullback at one point in 2021, and that will drag my stocks down as well...",1,0.6
2020-12-22 18:43:24,Which stagnating companies do you believe has the most potential to transform itself in the coming years?,"Dominoes (DPZ) a pizza company starts focusing heavily on software and its delivery app. Stock shoots up \~20x since 2000.

Axon Enterprise Inc (AAXN) a company that focuses on weapons and law enforcement, starts focusing on cloud and SaaS. Stock shoots up \~20x since 2013.

Microsoft (MSFT), Satya Nadella replaces Steve Ballmer as CEO in 2014. Begins to diversify microsoft into cloud, SaaS, and so on. Stock shoots up by 5X.

Micro Devices (AMD), Lisa Su takes over as CEO in 2014, AMD begins releasing microprocessors that are more advanced than Intel's. Stock shoots up 20X.

And lastly I'm assuming the recent huge run-up with Game Stop (GME) is due to the new CEO having plans on transforming it into an eCommerce/eSports company, especially with their recent partnership with Microsoft.

You typed ""Nasdaq P/E ratio"" into google and found the P/E ratio of the financial services corporation NDAQ. Not only that but in the above post it was the first point of evidence to suggest that the economy isn't in a bubble, a post that reached the top of this sub's front page. I have personally seen this mistake at least three other times in the comments. 

Here's a [previous comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/k17akp/20256m_shares_traded_hands_on_pltr_today/gdp1hwe/?context=3) of mine elaborating on it from a month ago:

Back of the hand calculation for the weighted average P/E ratio of those index leaders from a month ago is: **175.2**, and it's even higher now largely due to Tesla. P/E is high even without Tesla at a weighted average of **58.2**. 

The S&P P/E (shiller P/E) is currently [34.26](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe). Market cap / GDP is **1.88**, [higher than it's been since at least the 1970's, and who knows how long before that before that](https://www.longtermtrends.net/market-cap-to-gdp-the-buffett-indicator/). The historical trend line sits around 0.8

2020-11-25 21:42:34,WHY to exit a position vs. WHEN to exit a position.,"**EDIT:** YES, I am aware that I would have lost out a ton if I had exited early out of TSLA, AMD, AAPL, etc..etc..etc.. This is true. I'd also like to say that I've lost a significant amount by not jumping out of these companies. Greed is a dangerous thing. That said, I realize that the missing element for me was having multiple portfolios. If you split cash up into YOLO-Aggressive, Aggressive and Retirement, then you'll have the mental space to work different strategies and risk options into your portfolio.

**EDIT 2:** Compounding is your friend, but can also be your enemy with losses.

**EDIT 3:** If you look at my post history you can see that my options calls anticipated a much higher return than 20% - those were strategies listed for my Ultra Aggressive portfolio. I still invested in them in my lower-risk portfolio, but had different exit points, and different investments (longer-term calls and stocks vs. short-term OTM calls).

&#x200B;

The question isn't \*when\* you should get out, its **why** you should get out.

Remember, the goal isn't 1 10x gain (though that's pretty amazing, right?!). The number of companies that see a 10x gain are < 1%. However, if you get out at say a 80% gain, you're looking at a significantly larger chance of that happening. If you're looking at a 20% gain then, many companies can give you that return.

**Understand what your end goal is and break it down on how you can get there. Run toward that dream instead of running away from whatever it is that you think money will help you escape from.**

So what's all this mean? Figure out where you're trying to get to. Want to turn 10,000 into 1,000,000?

You could hope for 1 stock that you're fully invested in generating a 100x (1000% return). Chances of that happening... minimal. Chances of that 10,000 turning into 15,000 (50%) return much better. Look, making 1,000,000 out of 10,000 is NOT easy. It's luck, timing, and to an extent skill and discipline.

If you want to make a million bucks out of a single win on a 10,000 investment, you need to find something that's going to generate a 10,000% return. Good freaking luck. But... do you think you could find opportunities that can generate a 20% return? Probably so. Yes, you'll need to do this 500 times, but if you don't think you have the time and discipline to to find 500 opportunities in 700 days (2 trading years)... I mean... take a step back and breathe... Of course 10,000% is possible - you'll see that in WSB all the time. But what you won't see are the other two types of people:

1. People who made that 10,000% return over several years. Guarantee you this group is larger than that # of people who generated a single 10,000% return on 1 investment.
2. People who lost it all chasing that 10,000% return who have no interest in sharing their pain for BS karma points.  Guarantee you that this group is significantly larger than group 1.

&#x200B;

**To put this all in perspective: Do you think you'd have an easier time of generating:**

\- 1 10,000% return or

\- 500 20% returns.

Put another way, do you think you could generate 1 20% return each day for the next couple years? It's not easy at all. But then again, if that's not very easy, then exactly how easy is generating 1, 10,000% return. And what happens if you lose your 10,000 on 1 investment that went south (cough...SPX weekly puts / calls)

**BEGINNING INVESTMENT:** $10,000

**EXPECTED OUTCOME:** $1,000,000

|\# of positive investment outcomes|% return required|Chances of this happening|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|10,000%|Really freaking low|
|10|1,000%|Really, really low|
|20|500%|still really low|

|100|100%|MSFT hands these out in the long run|
|200|50%|doable|
|500|20%|Really, really doable|

&#x200B;

**EDIT: A note about compounding.**

If you consistently re-invested your gains, you'd only need 25 successful outcomes. This is doable, but it's incredibly risky as you're assuming (much like I did above) that every investment leads to a 20% gain. If you were to put all your eggs into one basket then this is what compounding *looks* like.

&#x200B;

**EDIT: A note about reality**

You're not going to consistently make 20% gains each investment. Some will be -5%, -25%, - 100% and others will be 5%, 20%, 100%, 400%. There are entire books, companies, funds etc...dedicated to figuring out how / when / who to invest in. I'm not going there. My point is not what you should invest in, but a reality check that turning 10,000 into a million is absolutely doable. If you go in knowing what it takes to get there, then you'll know **why** you need to sell a position (hint: so you can go on an re-invest that sum into another investment that is undervalued and hasn't yet returned what it's capable of returning)

2018-03-31 11:31:03,Explain MSFT's valuation,"I am not a trained or experienced investor.  I am just curious.  I say all this to mean, many or all of my assumptions may be wrong.

Microsoft's current market cap is ≈$700B.  Being a naive investor, I would assume that if I were buying part of a business I would value it on the following basis:  what is the current value of its balance sheet and what do I expect its cash earnings to be over some future period of time.  

Microsoft's end of 2017 book value was $27B.  2017 EBITDA was $33B.  Book value has been steadily declining over the last 5 years and EBITDA has been flat at about $30B.  Let's ignore the decline in book value for now and assume it will remain the same.  So I buy today at a market cap of $700B, that means that it will take 22 years to break even ([$700B market value - $27B book value] / $30B annual EBITDA = 21.7 years).

How is this a sane investment?  What am I missing?

2020-10-23 11:31:34,Are there any studies of the performance of investors who bought and held stocks for 10+ years vs the market?,"The average retail investor has a ROI of 2% vs the S&P 500’s return of 9.8%. 

But this obviously includes people who make a ton of emotional trades. For example people who doubt their choice and liquidate everything when it underperforms in the short term. People who try to time the market. People who sell solid  innovative companies too early to “lock in gains”. 

And then we’re comparing this to a theoretical person who buys the entire market and never sells. 

But what about comparing people who buy and hold their top 5-10 individual stocks and never sell? 

So far I tried backtesting this with various blue chip stocks like McDonald’s, Costco, Apple, BRK, google, j&j, WM, GE, Intel and so forth. For 10+ years and almost all of them outperformed the market. 

I even tried getting rid of the obvious massive tech winners and just relied on “boomer” stocks like McDonald’s, coca-cola, Costco j&j and GE from 2010-2020 and it just very slightly underperformed the market with 11.71 CAGR vs 12.97 CAGR of the S&P. 

But if you do a longer time period of 15+ years the boomer portfolio actually outperformed the market. 

Every time I see studies promoting index funds it always compares the emotional retail investor vs the market. Or the fund managers who aren’t allowed to take risk or have to show quarterly results vs the market. 

But I think a more fair comparison are retail investors who also buy, hold and never sell vs the market and fund managers with a long term strategy 10+ years such as the ARK ETFs vs the market.",36,0.87

2020-11-12 02:26:40,Goldman Sachs has just boosted its S&P Target. Here's why," 

The news that the COVID-19 vaccine from drugmaker Pfizer (PFE) and its partner  BioNTech  (BNTX) is 90% effective, according to  Bernstein Research  strategist  Inigo Fraser Jenkins , has sent stocks scurrying like ""tracks left in a cloud chamber from particles scattering in an accelerator.""

Goldman Sachs strategists, led by  David Kostin , say the vaccine is a more important development for the economy and markets than the prospective policies of a Biden presidency. ""The divisive  U.S.  presidential campaign was actually a backdrop to the main event: a public health crisis that has tragically claimed 240,000 lives in the  U.S.  since it began. However, within less than a year, a vaccine has been discovered,"" they say.

The Goldman team boosted its year-end price target on the S&P 500 to 3700 from 3600, which isn't so far away from Tuesday's closing level of 3545.53. Goldman is also targeting 4300 by the end of 2021 and 4600 by the end of 2022.

The strategists expect the Pfizer vaccine, and possibly others, will receive emergency use authorization by the end of January, and sufficient doses will be available for the  U.S.  population during the first half of 2021. They increased earnings estimates, mostly reflecting the better-than-expected results for the third quarter. They also are expecting better growth in the  U.S.  next year than the market does, at 5.3% versus the consensus forecast of 3.8%. A weakening  U.S.  dollar and slack in the labor market should support S&P 500 sales and margins, they add.

They are not too worried about the weight of the technology giants -- Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and  Google  owner Alphabet (GOOGL). The S&P 500 would rise 9% if the FAAMG stocks trade sideways and the remaining 495 stocks rise by the historical median 12-month rise of 12%. And the S&P 500 would rise 16% if the FAAMG stocks rise 5% and the remaining 495 climb 20%, which would represent an 80th percentile move based on historical distribution since 1990.

As for the debate about value or growth, the Goldman team likes both. For value stocks, the team noted that Monday was the largest single-day increase in the factor's history since 1980, while they say growth stocks should continue to benefit from weak trend economic growth and low interest rates.

""When thinking about the potential resolution of today's record valuation dispersion, investors often recall the unwind of the tech bubble, which was characterized by a two-year bear market and large negative absolute returns of the previous market leaders. More often than not, however, value rallies tend to occur in rising markets during which high valuation stocks also rise but are outpaced by the lowest valuation firms. This 'catch up' dynamic is what we expect will take place in coming months as a vaccine is approved and distributed,"" the strategists say.",39,0.79

2020-09-03 17:38:23,Stock market bloodbath: Dow and Nasdaq plummet in the worst day since June,"Thursday was the Nasdaq's largest one-day decline from a record high in its history, according to Bespoke Investment Group.

All three major indexes finished the day sharply lower. The Nasdaq closed down nearly 5%, and the S&P fell 3.5%, while the Dow finished 2.8%, or 808 points, lower.

So, what happened?

For one, the Nasdaq has been outperforming the other two major stock indexes — the Dow (INDU) and the S&P 500 (SPX) — for months. The rally has been going on for long enough that investors are now taking profit.

Even so, the Nasdaq remains up nearly 28% in 2020, still far outpacing its counterparts. The Dow, which only recently turned positive for the year, is back in the red.

""Although there is no single driver for the weakness, it seems as if investors all of a sudden realized how overbought stocks are and sold. Someone yelled fire in a crowded theater and everyone left at once,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, in emailed comments.

But there are also technical reasons for Thursday's decline: As US-China relations sour, investors are moving money out of tech, which could get hit the hardest from a potential increase in tariffs.

""The Nasdaq is getting hit hard with the continued rotation into cyclicals and expectations big-tech will ultimately pay the cost to a further deterioration with US-Chinese relations,"" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.

Stocks in cyclical sectors are expected to perform better as the economy is recovering.

The Big Tech companies such as Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT), all of which are part of the Nasdaq, have become the safe-haven investment of the summer. But investors have beginning to wonder when the rally will run out of steam, either because of increased regulation or because the economy as a whole picks up enough to void the need for safety picks altogether.

2021-01-12 23:34:47,Buying at the ATH/FOMO," I heard today that more often than not, a stock produces the best gains when people buy at its current all time high. I was wondering what everyone's experience is with this. I don't have FOMO when I buy long-term stocks like AAPL, MSFT, etc. since I'm sure they'll still provide steady gains for years to come. However, I'm more iffy on other stocks that have reached their all time highs, as I worry that it won't produce much more than it has. Take ETSY for example. I planned on buying a share yesterday morning with my $200, since they were at about $183. Then I saw in the pre-market that it shot up to about $206. So I bought a share of Disney instead, since I'm more confident in them in the long-term. My question is, are most people confident in these growth stocks like ETSY to continue shooting up and constantly breaking their ATH? I'm still learning how to do all my proper research on companies and industries, but I don't see them turning into the next GOOG or AMZN or anything. As a result, it makes me feel like I wouldn't see as many gains with this stock. I don't have enough money to buy multiple shares, and I wouldn't want to buy one share of a company and only make about $50 when I could've bought more shares of a cheaper stock for more gains. It's not so much that I have FOMO with growth stocks, it's more like fear of not maximizing potential gains. Thoughts?",0,0.5

- Return on the most upvoted pick: Disney (DIS) 1%

- Highest returning pick: Enphase (ENPH) 1110% (recommended by /u/williemax)

- If you invested in the top 5 most upvoted stocks, you would have seen a 27% return

- If you invested in the top 5 most controversial stocks, you would have seen a 99% return

- The top 10 gainers in order were ENPH, TSLA, APT, DXCM, OKTA, AYX, BAND, ALU, WIX, LRCX

The partnership will see GameStop standardize its business operations on Microsoft's cloud solutions.

The retailer says the arrangement will further advance its strategy to expand its physical and digital video game offerings, as well as enhance the company’s retail technology infrastructure.

As part of its transformation, GameStop plans to roll out Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams to its stores, empowering more than 30K store associates with enhanced productivity and collaboration tools.

2021-01-12 06:58:09,is investing in IPOs always a losing prospect?,"With a large of amount of tech IPOs over the last few months and with the Coinbase IPO coming up (I'm personally interested in it, same with the robinhood IPO). I have been looking for research on IPO theory and any academically supported trading strategies when I came across this article:

""There always seems to be a relatively steady stream of IPOs ripe for investors to be taking advantage of possibly huge gains – or huge losses. IPOs are sometimes seen as attractive to investors because they can get in on nearly the ground floor of when a firm open’s its doors to the broader market. But the question is if this is generally a good thing for investors to do, invest in IPOs or don’t invest.

What is an IPO?

First, we should answer what an IPO stands for – it stands for initial public offering. An Initial Public Offering (IPO) refers to the process of offering shares of a private corporation to the public with a new stock issuing. Initial Public Offerings let firms raise capital from public investors. Generally, the change from private company into a public company lets private investors reap gains from their investment, these often include shares and option contracts for private investors. While, public investors get to purchase a small piece of the company.

What’s the benefit of investing early?

Well, the benefit of investing in an IPO for a successful company is big gains – for example if you had invested in $5,000 into Microsoft (MSFT) when it went public, you’d be looking at millions of dollars’ worth of gains – around 10.4 million. While obviously these massive gains are attractive for long term investors, the reality reflects a type of bias called survivorship bias. In fact, there’s a large body of research looking at IPOs and how profitable they are for investors. They attempt to answer just how profitable are such trades.

Research paper one – Does it pay to invest in IPOs?

Paper one is entitled “ Does it pay to invest in IPOs? Evidence from the Warsaw Stock Exchange ” which looks at IPOs on the Polish market between 2003 and 2011. They attempt to calculate IPO performance while taking into account transaction costs, alternative costs, and taxes. They analyzed this period because it was generally a bullish time period with one notable sharp correction in equities during 2007 and another short correction in 2011. At the height of the market in 2007 and 2011, there were more than 13.5 and 6.3 times the number of IPOs compared to 2003, respectively (The data from warsaw hints to another conclusion from other papers, that IPOs tend to happen near  market highs ). The total data set collected was 314 companies which conducted an IPO from 2003 – 2011.

The statistics section of the paper analyzes the returns of the stock and looks at abnormal returns within said time period. On average anything with an average return of above zero means that the IPO outperformed the market for said time period. Generally, the evidence suggests that the best strategy is to buy the stock and then sell on the same day for the best returns. The longer one holds onto an IPO the worse the returns are. The remaining graphs generally support this finding as there are positively skewed with a positive kurtosis meaning most of the returns fall closer to the mean and are generally positive for the initial day return.  

Research paper two – The persistence of IPO Mispricing

Another paper that looks at IPOs and initial returns paired with long run performance is a paper called “The Persistence of IPO Mispricing and the Predictive Power of Flipping.” The paper looks at “hot” IPO markets and attempts to determine if underwriters have difficulty in valuing companies. The main results are, yes, underwriters do have difficulty valuing and often under value companies – primarily those IPOs which are harder to value due to high levels of uncertainty like in tech fields. This paper was of interest because they classified “Hot” IPOs as high variability and high returns and they also test a trading strategy for use with IPO stocks.

The paper looked at IPOs between 1988 and 1995. The dataset consisted of around 1,232 initial public offerings. A fairly sizable sample size during one a very studied time period – the time leading up to the internet bubble. In the paper, the authors breakdown the sample size into four distinct groups in order to test the strategy “Cold” IPOs which are defined with a first day opening of zero or negative returns (around 26% of IPOs). While, the remaining ones are classified as “Cool”, “hot” and “Extra-hot”. “Cool” which accounts for 35% of the data has returns of zero to less than 10% on the first day of IPO. While “hot” are returns of 10% or greater but less than 60% returns and account for 36% of the sample. And finally, “Extra-Hot” are returns above 60%.

The first notable finding here is that extra hot IPOs perform less well than cool and hot IPOs. They found that ‘cold’ IPOs fell on average 1.4% in the month following offering. Further, they found that the mean and median of one-month excess returns for cold and extra hot IPOs are negative. However, the return is positive for ‘cool’ and ‘hot’ IPOs and continues into the six month and one-year time frame – and these results were significant.

""We find that the mean and median one-month excess return for cold and extra-hot IPOs is negative while the same return is positive for cool, and hot categories. The relationship of cold and extra-hot to cool and hot IPOs continues at the six-month and one-year time frames as well. In parametric as well as non parametric statistical tests,the differences between the four groups are significant at conventional levels""

Another notable finding from this paper is the result that institutions often under price IPOs in order to profit for themselves by selling shares onto the market on the first day or over the course of the first few months:

“That  is, ‘flippers’ quickly sell issues which perform worst in the future (often with the benefit of underwriter price support which minimizes their exposure to losses), and they curtail flipping activity in the best performing issues.    The evidence suggests either (1) that institutional investors have superior information relative to the underwriter in the market for IPOs (since they collectively appear to know and execute a profitable trading strategy on the first day), or (2)  that  underwriters  intentionally and  strategically  under-  and  over-price IPO ‘merchandise’ without immediate measurable penalties.”

Summary:

Both papers suggest something interesting, that trading IPOs can be a sound strategy if one gets lucky enough with them. However, one looked at buying into IPOs on the first day and holding them for various periods of time and found that, on average IPOs lost during the course of the next year. However, the paper on IPO mispricing found that if investors wait a day and classify the IPO into categories that first day returns can help predict future returns. Perhaps a sound strategy is to buy into them on the first day and then watch the returns, if they are a “cold” or “extra hot” IPO, you sell out of them the following trading day. But if they are not within those return ranges, investors hold onto them.""

https://www.informedfinancials.com/2021/01/10/initial-public-offerings-and-profitability-for-investors/

TLDR:basically the strategy is to buy in on the first day and then depending upon how the first day results go, you either continue to hold it, or you sell out of it for a profit. I haven't traded IPOs before and was wondering if this is a good strategy for if they should be avoided entirely? I've also heard IPOs as ""It's probably overpriced."" I suppose it also depends on the financials of the company too.",1,0.57
2020-10-17 00:09:38,Why are people saying value investing is dead?,"Obviously value stocks haven’t performed this year, that’s why they’re value stocks, no? I think people look at 2020’s best growth stocks and see the excellent performance in a short period of time and automatically assume that value investing is dead. What they seem to forget is that a lot of the popular stocks now would have been fairly considered “value stocks” not even a couple years ago. For example AAPL had a PE of 12 in December 2018. In the early and mid 2010’s people were already dismissing Apple and looking elsewhere for opportunities. But the funny thing is is that AAPL was a “value stock” not even a couple years ago, so how can people reasonably say that value investing died? Isn’t AAPL a classic example of how value investing can win in the end? 

I know PE isn’t everything but it’s a solid tool to use. Here’s some more, MSFT was 100% a value stock until Nadella came in a few years ago and the stock skyrocketed. It had PEs around 10 in 2013 and 2016. People looked at MSFT the same way people look at CSCO or INTC today. 

I think my point is that people say value investing is dead, but the biggest winners of the last few years were “value stocks” that ended up breaking out of their undervalued state and dominating the market. I know AAPL and MSFT are obvious example now but 5,10 years ago they weren’t.

2021-01-14 17:01:46,My Watchlist For 1/15/2021 -- ThinkOrSwim Chart Import Links Included :)!,"\*\*I use the 180D/4H chart exclusively to start with these. Then I use the RSI, Stoch, Vortex, and 10-50-200 EMAs\*\*

&#x200B;

**$ARCT** \- Meteoric Rise to crash. But it is now testing volume support here, and it may hold. 500EMA being held, possible first pull back of large move here. RSI fair, Stoch fair

**$BILL** \- I love these. Channel resistance retests at support... love it. Might need a few days to develop but looks great. RSI fair, Stoch low, and Vortex crossing, good setup.

**$BURL** \- Same play as $BILL. Bouncing off the 50EMA, channel, and support -- but it looks like it is possibly tired. RSI and Vortex fair, but Stoch is low which is great.

**$CLNE** \- Pull back here, or closer to end near $9. I am not convinced either way but a great set up. Bouncing off 50EMA lovely, support close by. All indicators are fair

**$EGP**  \- Gorgeous channel up. Holding support at the POC and just tapped in channel. Indicators are fair, but that makes sensE being in the middle of an ascension. 

**$EVBG** \- Channel up that just hit resistance, it is gonna break through? It has 50EMA, support, and channel support. RSI fair, but Stoch low, Vortex consolidating; good setup.

**$EVTC** \- Great channel up as well. Bounces off the 50EMA. Bouncing off $37 support and now in channel again. RSI fair, but Sotch is low with divergence. May drop to 200EMA

**$IRWD** \- Channel up, bouncing off the 200EMA line. Good set up, but not true support line to hold it well. RSI fair, But Stoch low and Vortex getting there.

**$KTRA** \- BE careful. Just tapped support today and took off. Might have more in the tank; if not watchlist for later and buy in $1.30 Indicators say it has room to still room!

**$MSFT** \- Obvious Blue-chip; but excellent deal. Ascending Triangle, at support, and channel -- love it. RSI is oversold-ish, Stoch and Vortex low, reversal coming.

**$NOW**  \- Beautiful channel up testing 200EMA, channel, and support. Great setup. All indicators fair but that makes sense at this price and channel action.

**$RVP**  \- JUST dropped off a cliff, after we made money 3 days ago! Channel, 200EMA, and support here, easy setup. RSI fair, but Stoch is low, so I like it a lot.

**$SEE**  \- Beautiful channel, right above 200EMA, and support - love it. Great setup. RSI low, Stoch low, Vortex low, all lining up great.

**$UPLD** \- Just a lovely channel up, but how much farther can it go?! Riding the 50EMA like a dream. Can be some easy %. All indicators are fair which makes sense with this melt up.

2020-11-07 09:46:55,Nintendo(TYO 7974) Analysis,"Nintendo, I think is the best gaming stock to buy. My partial reasonings:

* Gaming is all about IP. And Nintendo has the most recognisable IP. Mario, Pokemon(part ownership), Zelda etc have the brand recognition that few other games have.
* Pricing power. Nintendo can sell a game without giving any discounts and people will buy it. Case in point, Nintendo released its latest Super Mario 3d All-Stars games at $60, which are just 3 fairly simple ports. Yet, [they sold 5.21M copies within 12 days(at page 10).](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2020/201105_4e.pdf) Because of its IP strength, they are also able to sell older Wii-U ports at full price. Their titles also don't get much discounted. No other gaming company boast such pricing power among its player base. This is one of the reason there Operating Profits jumped 209% till September(click the first link).
* Lower development cost. Nintendo game philosophy is centred around the concept of ""fun"". So, unlike developers like Ubisoft, EA, Bethesda(parent acquired by MSFT), Rockstar, Activision Blizzard etc, they follow a unique strategy in developing games which results in a much lower development cost compared to their peers. Nintendo's gaming base(which includes hyper fans to children) is also supportive of its efforts. This has two-way benefits for Nintendo compared to its peers.
   * Development costs of games are skyrocketing and at this rate, these companies will slowly have more difficulty in recouping costs.
   * Nintendo's development cost, while not known per games is hypothesized to be lower. This means Nintendo finds it much easier to recoup costs.
* Other game companies in different stock exchanges worldwide have much higher multiples of valuations. Nintendo, who is expected to have higher growth(for the next 4 years) than most of the developers I have searched for, is relatively cheaply valued. [Simple Valuation Comparison.](https://imgur.com/gallery/j2EqHcx)
* Nintendo has more than adequate cash buffer. It is [currently the most cash-rich company in Japan.](https://news.livedoor.com/lite/article_detail/18788644/) Given Nintendo's experimental strategies, this ensures that Nintendo is extremely unlikely to face any liquidity crisis.
* Nintendo is also a platform holder. Which means it stands to profit from every game sold by other developers in its platform and its own games have a higher margin. This also allowed it to launch Switch Online subscription service, which while cheap, could provide a hefty return, especially in the upcoming few years. Also, unlike Sony and Microsoft, Nintendo actually makes money from the beginning while selling each console.
* Future plans(rumour based)
   * Nintendo is expected to release a pro version of Switch(or just upgrade the Switch internals) which would boost Switch sales(management already upgraded forecast today by 20%).
   * Nintendo management didn't shy away from the possibility of launching other forms of online gaming service. They are experimenting with game streaming. Control: Ultimate Edition is already available to stream in Nintendo Switch.
   * Many others not mentioned here for brevity's sake.
* Growing diversified revenue source.
   * Their merchandising business is going to grow along with its gaming revenues.
   * Unique products like the Mario Kart: Home Circuit, Amiibos(which are a combined form of merchandise and in-app purchase), Nintendo Labo etc points to a company that has managed to integrate the physical and virtual world very competently. These products while a small part of its revenue equation would likely keep on growing.
   * Their cinema ventures(an upcoming movie in partnership with Illumination) could grow further. Management has stated that they are likely to invest in these ventures more based on their success. This may result in TV shows and similar products getting released more. It must be mentioned though, Nintendo generally uses partnerships to venture into these markets and doesn't directly release the products, which means they get a small portion of the overall revenue.
   * Theme park partnership with Universal.
* Upcoming titles could add significant profit potentials for Nintendo. Although we don't exactly know what they will be, management has already stated that they have merged their development efforts(before it was split among Wii-U and 3ds) which would lead to higher outputs.
   * One of the disappointments is that Nintendo still seems to have not poured enough resources into its mobile gaming efforts and seems like we wouldn't get any revolutionary products like Pokemon Go. However, Nintendo published games in the Switch have very high attachment rates which somewhat counters the lack of games on mobile.
   * As an example, let's compare Super Mario Odyssey against Witcher 3. Witcher 3(an extremely popular game and released a movie), which released in 2015 and is available in many platforms sold around 50M(as of May) copies. The base price of the game has been much lower than the $60 price Nintendo requires. Yet, Super Mario Odyssey sold around 19M copies being in a single platform. This, by no means, is an apple to an orange scenario. But I presented this example to illustrate the next point I am coming to and to make you aware of the strength of the Switch platform.
* Brand loyalty. Nintendo fans are very brand loyal because of the unique market approach of Nintendo. While other publishers are constantly barraged with gamer complaints and vocal minorities, Nintendo, while keeping its fans loyal, managed to shield itself from much of the disdain some gamers have towards other publishers. EA, Activision Blizzard, Epic, Ubisoft(even CD Projekt Red) etc seems to be constantly bamboozled by their vocal minority fans. As a result, the sense of community and brand loyalty is missing. Nintendo tends to do exceptionally well in this regard which is necessary for sustainable game sales. This also somewhat explains the exceptional attachment rates, pricing power etc. Its various games' fanbase also has a reputation of being helpful and welcoming, lacking the toxicity(Smash is an exception) of other gaming communities.
* Competent management. This is the name of the game. While other studios constantly seem to be in the need to change in management, developer exits etc. Current Nintendo management has proved itself to be worthy. 
* ARKK contains NTDOY as a holdings.

Risks:

* Nintendo has a habit of creating extremely profitable products and then suddenly getting derailed. However, for the next 4 years, this sort of mishap is unlikely to happen.
* Sony and Microsoft are going to release their next-generation consoles. Although, this is unlikely to dent sales(because of Nintendo's blue ocean strategy) as management didn't really imply that it would happen; instead they chose to upgrade the sales forecast.

Final commentary:

Gaming has entered a mega-trend territory. I think Nintendo is best positioned to capture this mega-trend as they have all the ingredients of success. Plus, Nintendo being undervalued compared to its peers make it a good opportunity to ride this trend.

Gaming is ultimately a risky business and no other publisher(other than MSFT, which already is valued to the teeth) is as well positioned in this market as Nintendo.

TL;DR: I think Nintendo is the best stock for the next 3-4 years among other gaming stocks.

Have a good day! :-)

2020-08-23 13:04:54,Differences and similarities between 2000 and now.,"
I've posted bits and pieces of this in some comments since some form of the question has come up on this subreddit. I want to list out a list of reasons why today is like the dot com times and ALSO what is different about today. I am not a financial professional, but I have been working in the tech industry for over 20 years. It is mostly tech stock focused.

I'm going to also add (fact) or (anecdotal) or (opinion) to my bullet points, so take those bullet points with the appropriate grain of salt.

Reasons we are NOT like the dot-com boom (roughly in order of importance):

* (fact) Interest rates are much lower now and long term expectations on yield is also low. In 1999, the 10 year treasury was at around 5% and rose to over 6.5% in 2000. The P/E of the S&P 500 in 2000 was around 30. Which means that the 10 year treasury yielded MORE than the S&P 500 earnings. This is absolutely not true today with the 10 year treasury yield being around 0.6% and P/Es being around 25-30. This single point is extremely important to understand.
* (fact) Late stage VCs are more of a thing now than they were in dot com. Thus you have fewer IPOs and the companies that do are more mature and less speculative (of course there are outliers, see below).
* (fact) The NASDAQ P/E in 2000 was really quite ridiculous (I can't find a chart for some reason, i think it was around 80). S&P 500 was more comparable between 2000 and now.
* (anecdotes) You can no longer get a job at a startup / real tech firm just because you know HTML or can write ""hello world"" in Perl. A lot of firms back in the late 90's were trying to fatten up the employee count and race to IPO to cash out. This doesn't happen today.
* (fact) There was no pandemic in 2000 and it makes comparisons hard.

Reasons we are like the dot-com boom (roughly in order of importance)

* (anecdotes) Sentiment on the ground is very similar to what you hear during the dot com boom. We make fun of the people who invest in stupid shit like NKLA, HTZ, etc. But a lot of people are creaming their pants still on the big tech (FAMANG) saying they are forever-holds / they can't go down, etc. You also now are starting to see intelligent, rational people putting money in things **precisely** because other people will and assume they can get out before it all falls apart.
* (fact) In the late 90s, internet brokers were a new thing and made trading easier for people who didn't know anything -- and we see that today with COVID stay-at-homers and an influx of users into robinhood (I wish I could get hard numbers on the comparison). (opinion) Because of this, I'm fairly certain pricing is out of whack for a large number of companies.
* (fact) The P/E ratios of the big techs today are higher than a lot of the big techs during 2000. Nasdaq P/E in 2000 was off the chart, but if you just look at the big profitable companies like INTC, ORCL, AAPL, HPQ, IBM, which were the equivalent of FAMANG today, they had P/Es mostly under 30s. FAMANG are around 35 except for Netflix and Amazon which are much higher (see huge caveat on interest rates above). CSCO and MSFT in 2000 were the outliers having P/Es of well over 60.
* (anecdotes) In tech companies, a common business plan for new firms in the last ~8 years is to get market share at any cost and figure out profitability later. This is really no different from dot com when firms were valued by number of ""eyeballs"".
* (opinion) ""this time is different"". At least in terms of technology, it's not. The internet itself was a bigger ""paradigm shift"" than what we are seeing today. I used ""paradigm shift"", because was a common buzzword that turned into a joke back in the late 90s and used to justify crazy valuations. Machine Learning is amazing, but not on par with connecting everyone on the globe. And the cloud is just a fancy name for running something on someone else's computer (even though its quite nice how easy and seamless it is today vs. 20 years ago).
* (anecdotes) While it is harder to IPO today without profitability or clear path to profitability, it clearly still happens (UBER, LYFT, SNAP). And others are using backdoor IPOs (NKLA, SPCE).
* (fact) In 2000, the IT sector along with Media stocks and the Telecommunications Services sector approached 40% of the S&P market cap. The categories have changed but if you combine IT and Communication Services sectors, you get a 38% of S&P market cap today. If you add Amazon which is not included in IT/Communication, you get over 40%. Does this mean anything, especially since we are in a pandemic and more stuff runs on IT? Not sure.

You can definitely pick apart some of the individual points, I just wanted to lay them all out and see what people thought and if anyone has other valid comparisons. I personally think we ARE in some kind of tech bubble, but I'm not going to make a fool of myself in predictions on when and how it will burst. And fuck it, while I do have more in cash than typical, I'm still in VTI/VXUS and a bunch of individual tech names since I have the background to do some analysis on the business.

I'll end with a few random thoughts:

* In August 1999, a lot of people were looking at the craziness of the dot com boom and how people were throwing money at stupid shit. I don't care what people say, it was pretty obvious something was wrong. If you shorted the NASDAQ then, you will watch the NASDAQ more than double in 7 months time and have your face ripped off.
* Taking what I've posted as a whole, the one thing to be terrified about is if long term interest rates rise and the fed is either powerless or does not step in for whatever reason. This will completely destroy the stock and bond market. I don't see the catalyst for it, but I'm no economic genius. You might be able to make an argument that gold is a hedge for this unlikely scenario. There is also the worry of a slump in earnings due to general economic malaise, but that is a garden variety concern that everyone is watching for and usually pretty temporary. Rise in interest rates would be real bad.",194,0.92
2020-08-28 13:09:41,Hershey: The quintessential Buy-And-Hold stock,"**Intro**

When it comes to building a portfolio of SWAN (sleep well at night) stocks for the long term, HSY is a layup. In the world of stock investing, HSY is an ideal stock for beginners and seasoned investors alike because of its relatively simple business model and its ability to generate consistent returns. The business itself is very straightforward. HSY owns some very recognizable brands such as Reese's and KitKat (HSY owns the rights to KitKat in the US). On average they manage to sell more candy than the year before and with it also raise prices at a rate higher than inflation. As the bulk of their profits are earned in the US, their income statements (reported in USD) are an accurate reflection of what they actually earned. Compare that to other excellent companies like CL, KO etc which are a little harder to evaluate as they earn most of their profits overseas and you have to factor in currency fluctuations to get the real picture (their annual reports usually do a good job of it though).  As Peter Lynch said, ""Invest in what you know"" and it's safe to say most Americans have consumed a Hershey's product at some point in their lives. Heck, you can even use the excuse of ""market research""  to buy some Reese's peanut butter cups the next time you go to the store.

[Morningstar does a great job putting together the financials.](https://financials.morningstar.com/ratios/r.html?t=0P000002NZ&culture=en&platform=sal) Check with your local library to see if you can get access to Morningstar or Value Line. It's very useful to anyone looking to research individual stocks. While paying for a subscription yourself can cost several hundreds of dollars annually, most public libraries in the US give you access to one or both of those services for free. I'll try to sum up the key metrics shared in the link above (anyone can view that page even without a subscription)

Over the last 10 years

Net sales growth of \~4% (What's even more impressive is that most of it was achieved with volume increases and pricing power alone. Acquisitions had little to do with it)

EPS growth 8-10%

Div yield 2-3% (The payout ratio stays around 50% which means you also see dividend growth that's 8-10%)

They buy back roughly 1% of outstanding shares each year.

Just like that you get 11-13% CAGR (excluding PE compression/expansion). ROIC consistently in the high teens to 20+ (consumer staples usually average in the mid teens)

Operating margin has increased from 17.4% to 21% (PEP for example was around 15% last year)

To check the quality of the balance sheet, we look at the interest coverage ratio and Net Debt w.r.t Operating Profits. With capital light businesses like HSY, their ability to grow profits/free cash flow is a better indicator of financial strength than shareholder equity.

Interest coverage ratio (Interest expense/EBIT) \~ 10 (A double digit value for a consumer staples company is considered very safe)

Net Debt/EBIT \~ 2.5 (Anything less than 3 for a consumer staples company is considered very safe)

&#x200B;

**Stock Performance**

HSY has historically fluctuated between a PE of 30 (overpriced) to a PE of 20 (a bargain). Every once in a blue moon the PE dips below 20 and the div yield approaches 3% at which point it becomes a screaming bargain. Barring a total economic collapse or horrendous mismanagement, it's very unlikely you'll see HSY trading at a PE of 15. I would say a PE of 23-25 is a fair price for a wonderful company.

As with any investment, the price you pay affects future returns. To get the real picture of returns generated by HSY, one needs to look at a full business cycle as consumer staples generally tend to outperform during a recession.

[The absolute worst time to buy HSY in the last 15 years](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=2&startYear=2005&firstMonth=4&endYear=2020&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&showYield=false&reinvestDividends=true&benchmark=VFINX&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=HSY&allocation1_1=100) would have been in early 2005 when the PE was over 30 and the dividend yield was below 1.5%. A $10,000 investment with dividends reinvested in April 2005 would result in a present value of $34,863 with a CAGR of 8.49% (underperformed the SPY which returned $37,404 at 8.98%).

[Buying it at its lows](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=2&startYear=2008&firstMonth=1&endYear=2020&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&showYield=false&reinvestDividends=true&benchmark=VFINX&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=HSY&allocation1_1=100) in early 2008 when the PE was under 20 and the dividend yield was over 3%, A $10,000 investment with dividends reinvested in January 2008 would result in a present value of $50,619 with a CAGR of 13.76% (outperformed the SPY which returned $28,659 at 8.73%).

Realistically speaking, for an investor who DCAs into this stock, their returns would've been somewhere between 8.5% - 13.8%. HSY is not a stock that you can expect 20%+ CAGR from, but with some luck compounding at 11-12% can build significant wealth (and potentially even outperform SPY).

**Risks**

As far as stocks go, HSY has to be one of the safest investments out there. The company is very conservatively run as the Hershey Trust owns roughly 40% of the company (but over 80% voting rights) and uses the dividends to fund a school for underprivileged children. The dividend is sacrosanct and HSY management is less likely to jeopardize the dividend in search of growth. Consumer staples as a business also face less disruption than other industries. Profits are consistent and the business requires fairly little reinvestment. Candy, alcohol and tobacco are centuries old and consumer tastes change fairly slowly which gives companies plenty of time to adapt. MSFT would go out of business if they were still selling the same OS they made in the 90s. HSY on the other hand is more or less still selling the same candy it was 30-40 years ago. That being said, past performance is no guarantee of future results. So let's address some realistic risks

\- Ruining the quality of the product due to cost cuts in search of short term profits. [Irene Rosenfeld at Mondelez did this to the Cadbury Creme Egg](https://theconservativeincomeinvestor.com/why-mondelez-stock-hasnt-gone-up/), which didn't bode well for the stock. A big part of the reason why I'm willing to pay a premium for a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup (over some generic brand candy) is because of the taste.  HSY would lose their hard earned market share and goodwill in search of short term gains.

\- Compromising the balance sheet for a bad acquisition. KHC is a good example of this. The 3G method involves slashing costs and levering up the balance sheet to acquire more businesses. Of course, if the acquisition doesn't pan out the stock gets punished accordingly. HSY has tried to build their international presence through acquisitions and it hasn't panned out well so far. Lately they've started diversifying into savory snacks. However, these tend to be pretty small in nature.

\- A sugar tax to combat obesity. I don't think it'll hurt the underlying business too much, but HSY might start trading at a lower earnings multiple.

\- E-commerce might affect HSY a bit. Outside of a few holidays the bulk of candy sales come from impulse purchases a consumer makes at the checkout counter at the store. It usually isn't something a person puts on their shopping list. I think with some proactive management, HSY can get around that by working with vendors to advertise their products while checking out online (much like how pizza joints upsell soda/breadsticks etc at checkout time).

**Conclusion**

If you've made it this far, I thank you for reading this post. I mostly wrote this for people who might be looking into buying individual stocks. I think HSY is an excellent stock for those looking for an above average dividend yield and dividend growth. Buffet often speaks fondly of his See's Candies investment. Much like his own investment, with some luck HSY's dividends alone can pay you back your initial investment and then some over an investing lifetime. As always, sticking with a low cost index fund is a sound strategy. Even a stock like HSY requires a few hours of work each year.

2020-12-04 16:41:23,Is AMZN the biggest player?,"I recently became very interested in outstanding shares and how the amount of shares can change for a stock over time. During the process, I charted AAPL, AMZN & MSFT for the last 15 years. I included share price, outstanding shares and assets into the charts (links below). 

All three companies experience exponential growth in their stock price as expected. What I find interesting is that Microsoft's outstanding shares have decreased in a somewhat linear fashion by roughly 30%. For Apple, outstanding shares increased slowly till around the time Steve Jobs died (figures) and then proceeds to decrease linearly for a total reduction of about 30% as well. On the contrary, AMZN has increased shares by 20% over the same period of time!

Now i'm curious what it all means?!

It's worth noting that AMZN's assets are seeing (what seems to be) exponential growth whereas microsoft is linear and apple when from a linear growth to a slight decrease for the past few years.

Is Besos creating that much more of a monster by creating shares consistently along the way so that the company has insane asset growth?

My comments:  
I definitely did not expect the stocks would be this high after just one year. There is a clear divide between the ""new tech"" and the ""efficient tech"" type of companies though: the latter stocks expanded in valuations by a lot. The price to sales on some of them doubled. I'd approach these with caution - the market seems to be a little too exstatic about them, but on the other hand it seems like capital has nowhere else to go so I can't imagine the market abandoning the valuations anytime soon. 

On the other hand the ""new tech"" stocks moved largerly side-ways with two outliers - HXL running into Covid19 trouble as an aerospace supplier and VRTX posting impressive earnings and continuing to execute well on their plan. All in all the valuations of these companies remained sensible in contrast to the ""efficient stocks"". While these should be the higher risk stocks, they seem now like a more reasonable investment.

It's interesting to hear how Buffett was thinking about Microsoft at the time. Especially his comparison to Coca-Cola. He obviously liked Microsoft and was believed they would continue to grow, but didn't have quite enough certainty about Microsoft's future to make an investment.

I really like this approach to investing. Perhaps not investing in Microsoft can be seen as a mistake in hindsight, but then again I'm sure over his career Buffett has managed to stir clear of many bad investments with this approach. 

I've always thought the most important lesson to learn as an investor isn't how to make money, but how to not lose it.

2020-11-01 11:08:20,Investing Strategies - Dividend Growth Investing - Advantages/Disadvantages + Breakdown,"# Introduction

Hello guys, this will be a breakdown for the Dividend Growth strategy. It is important to understand how companies need to be evaluated differently based on the investment philosophy you are pursuing. Now, investing in a dividend growth strategy takes time and patience, depending on your income goal, it can take awhile before a dividend portfolio can fully support enough cash flow to sustain your lifestyle without you needing to rely on a full-time or part-time job. But that is the exciting part, once you have enough income from the dividends you can retire or work a job that you perhaps find more exciting?

# The Strategy:

The dividend growth strategy is focused on building up a portfolio of high quality companies that not only pay out a dividend, but have regularly been increasing the dividend payout. The end goal is to create passive income to live off the increasing dividend payouts. So the focus is placed more on the cash flow for wealth rather than the stock appreciation (appreciation is ofcourse an added bonus).

NOTE: **Dividend yield is not main focus.** A common misconception is that a high dividend yield, is the most important measure, however, a yield that is considerably higher similar stocks in the same industry may indicate not a good dividend but rather a depressed price due to company issues. This price may signal a dividend cut or the elimination of the dividend. Most dividend ETFs will filter out the top percentage of dividends yields for this reason.

The strategy here is on the **dividend growth**. If a company increases their payout overtime it is going to have an insane snowball effect when the dividends are reinvested (kinda like the snowball effect for paying off debt). Dividend growth investing uses the compounding effect of reinvesting dividends into the same investment to increase your future dividend payments. With each reinvestment, your shares grow slightly larger. With slightly more shares, your next dividend payment is sightly larger. With enough time invested in solid companies, the growth effect is amazing. This is why dividend growers are so important, they add more fuel to this compounding effect!

If you really want to see this effect visualized, check out the charts for Warren Buffets wealth. In 2018 alone, Berkshire raked in **$3.8 billion** in dividends – “a sum that will increase in 2019,” Buffett said in the annual letter. The great majority of the stocks in Berkshire's portfolio are dividend stocks. And many of those stock are growing their dividend.

# Disadvantages:

* Dividends are not always guaranteed. In 2020, there we dozens of companies that cut their dividends due to financial pressure. At any moment, companies can hugely decrease their dividend payout or completely get rid of it. **However, there have been many quality companies that have still increased their payouts during this time.**
* Unless you are holding these stocks in an IRA you will pay taxes on them. Growth stocks typically don’t pay out so there’s no forced withdrawal, so you don’t get hit with taxes, however the trade off is you are now reliant on the appreciation of the stock.
* When compared to index investing it decreases diversification since you're really only invested into “large cap” stocks. You'll be missing out on the mid-cap and small-cap stocks
* Some say dividend payouts of the sign of a dying company. For some perhaps this is true, however a strong counter argument is this. If a company is well established and the payout for moving into a new market sector, or a new acquisition wouldn't be favorable, a company can instead payout dividends to entice investors rather than potentially sacrifice company value just in the name of potential growth.

# Advantages:

* Historically dividends have provided 43% of the S&P 500 total return from 1930 - 2017 (according to Blackrock). Dividends provide an ongoing return while waiting for capital appreciation.
* The snowball effect of dividend growth compounding can provide competitive returns regardless of whether the price of the stock increases in value or not.
* **Reinvesting dividends during sideways moving markets, bear markets, and corrections, purchase more shares with the dividend while the prices are lower. Later, when prices recover, the return is actually enhanced by the temporary fall in the stock price. Reinvesting dividends and accumulating more shares during corrections and bear markets greatly boosts dividend growth investing returns in the long run. This is a significant advantage of dividend stocks over growth stocks in less than ideal market conditions.**
* Creating passive income and preserving capital. Like all stocks they are an excellent hedge against inflation.

# Types of Companies to invest into:

Below will be a list of Dividend paying companies that have **increased their dividends yearly**. Often when you are researching these companies you will see them thrown into these categories based on how often they have increased their dividends:

* Challenger: 5+ years
* Contender: 10-24 years
* Champion/Aristocrat: 25+ years
* King: 50+ years

And now the companies (only a few common examples, there are way too many to list):

* AAPL - Apple - Challenger
* MSFT - Microsoft - Contender
* JPM - JPMorgan Chase - Challenger
* VZ - Verizon - Contender
* JNJ - Johnson and Johnson - King
* MMM - 3M - King
* T - AT&T - Champion
* KO - Coca-Cola - King

And so on, many of these companies are ones we all recognize because they are so well established have have very wide markets. They have incredible staying power for these reasons, often having enough money to expand into new markets by buying up new companies or just allocating free capital to the sectors.

# How to evaluate the companies for this strategy:

Since the focus of this investing is less on capital appreciation and more on the dividend growth we need to evaluate the following factors:

* Dividend payout ratio:
   * Payout less than 50% of its earnings in the form of dividends is generally considered stable
   * The company has the potential to raise its earnings over the long term.
* Free Cash Flow to Equity:
   * This is simply what is paid out after expenses and debts have been paid. If a company has too much debt it can affect their ability to continue paying out and increasing their dividends.
* Debt to EBITDA ratio (Earnings before interest depreciation and amortization)
   * A company with a lower ratio, when compared to similar companies, is more attractive. See AT&T vs Verizon!
* **High dividend yield are not the focus and can often signal an unsustainable payout! Look for companies in the healthier 3-6% range. (Do research after this ofcourse, this doesn't immediately mean it is healthy)**

There are ofcourse many other factors. Consider the business, does it have a sustainable model (Coca-Cola $ Pepsi)? Is its market shrinking (See oil companies)? Do you like the company and management?? For this type of investing (any type really), you need to know what you are investing into!

# Performance & Final Thoughts:

It depends on what timeframe you are looking at, if say we take from December 1999 - 2017 the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index outperformed the S&P 500 by 3.37% per year. But if we take other timeframes then the S&P500 is dominant. Beating the S&P500 over the long term is near impossible, but **beating the S&P isn't the goal of this strategy**. This strategy is focused on passive income.

Please supplement this post with your own research. Compare this strategy to general index investing and growth investing. Find what is right for you.

The hope is this post provided insight into this strategy and evaluating dividend paying companies. Each different type of investor can learn from the other, dividend vs index vs growth or otherwise. Anyways, have a good day everyone!

2021-01-04 12:29:08,How do you handle changes in currency exchange rates?,"Hello r/investing

I have a question regarding currency exchange rates. I live in Sweden and our currency is called SEK, Swedish crowns. About 70% of my portfolio is stocks (the rest ETF:s) and 100% of those stocks are traded on American markets. 

The current prognosis of the USD/SEK exchange rate is that the Swedish crown is going to strengthen, hence 1 USD = less Swedish crowns. How should one handle this currency risk? For example, I bought MSFT shares a couple of months ago for $202 per share, today they're $216 which implies a 7% increase in value. Over this period the USD/SEK exchange rate went from 8,8 SEK per USD (which is the rate I bought at) to 8,2 SEK per USD, i.e. a 7% decrease. These two movements cancel out, and I'm break even. 

How can one handle changes in currency exchange rates? And how can one minimize the effects on his/her investments, mainly stocks and funds.

**AMZN** jumped so much because it's actually expanding its business through their own delivery system (like you might've seen some prime-labelled vehicles parked on your street), and people increased their online buying habits while not going out, so its price grew a lot during this few months, which I believe is justified.

2020-09-30 15:31:55,Monopolies and Peter Lynch on Beating the Market,"Hi all, this is just my personal opinion, let's get straight to the point:

Although most people don't realize it, there are monopolies all around us. I'm going to specifically focus on tech companies as they produce the highest returns (as far as I'm aware) and tech is the industry that I'm most familiar with (from real life), but this should also apply to any industry.

When I'm saying ""monopoly"", I don't refer to the economic definition of"" a company that's actively preventing competition"", but rather to the more lose definition by Investopedia of ""when a company and its product offerings dominate a sector or industry"". Also, we'll be focusing only on the US market and US  companies. General knowledge: ""a market share of greater than 50% has been necessary for courts to find the existence of monopoly power."" According to the US Department of Justice, so we'll go off of that 50% rule.

&#x200B;

Take Google, for example, a monopoly on search engines. According to an article from Visual Capitalist (published on Business Insider), Google and YouTube handle more than 90% of all internet searches (YouTube is owned by Google). Realistically speaking that's a monopoly.

Look at Amazon and the exact same things happen with e-commerce. According to marketer.com, Amazon has a 38.7% US market share. While this is certainly not above 50%, Amazon is still the most dominant player in online retail in the US by a huge margin.

Apple is without argument a ""monopoly"" on the US phone and (potentially) computer market. 

Microsoft is the outlier here because we're looking at it on a global scale but we can see according to statista.com, that it has a 72.9% Global market share of operating systems, thus it has a global monopoly on it.

So my analysis is not perfect, but you also have to remember that each company is well established, with good historical returns (stock wise, and I'm assuming income wise as well), and they all have a multitude of income sources.

""Alright alright, you've made your point, so now what?"":

So let's assume that I believe that long-term these ""monopolies"" will remain as the dominant players, and because of that and other factors (believing in the company for example), I want to invest in them and only in them (assume GOOG, AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, 25% of the portfolio each).

Often people will say that diversification is an issue with an all tech portfolio, but backtesting for the past 15 years (which isn't that short) shows that tech simply beats the market. That leads me to the second part of the title about Peter Lynch. Lynch has said that ""in order to beat the index, you just take the worst performers out"". Sometimes this will come with more risk, sometimes not. So my question to you is, ignoring the debate about diversification, is there something else that I'm missing?

Here is a screenshot of the backtesting results, assuming you started with $10,000, rebalanced annually, and reinvested dividends. You can even see that the tech portfolio (Portfolio 2) has presumably less risk due to a higher shrape ratio of the SP500 (Portfolio 1): [i.imgur.com/tZl63Ej.png](https://i.imgur.com/tZl63Ej.png)

Thanks for any answers, I'll be happy to take questions as well.

EDIT:
A lot of people say that I've fallen prey to a bias of picking the best performers and then saying in hindsight why they were successful. So we found that the best performers are also tech monopolies (big deal). We also know in hindsight that these companies share (the same) other traits of success (like good revenue), but that's usually a by-product of the monopoly. Now, is it not reasonable to assume that if something is a tech monopoly that it'll play a big part in its success?
If that's a reasonable assumption, then the 4 companies I chose should (for the most part) continue being successful until their status as a monopoly, or something else that's drastic enough (like government intervention) will change. Also, I focus on tech because that's the field I'm most knowledgeable in, which by chance happens to be the be performing sector. I only want to invest in companies I understand.

EDIT 2:
For people saying that ""the returns on these companies aren’t good because they started out as monopolies, they started out small and grew to their position today, thus the high returns."" - Google already had a 56.3% market share in 2007 (digitalsuregeons.com), Amazon I'm pretty sure was always the significant player in US online retail (eBay is auctions not online retail, but still have been passed by Amazon), Apple had the most market share for a single company already in 2014 (Forbes), and Microsoft had a near 100% OS global market share already in 2010 (statista.com) and it even dropped a bit but their stock's performance is still great. Please note that these values fluctuate but it proves that except for apple, most of the backtesting period shows returns from times that these companies were already monopolies.",16,0.69

2020-09-14 09:23:19,Oracle wins race to bottom to acquire TikTok US Operations as “trusted partner”,"Oracle Corp. ORCL +5.49% won the bidding for the U.S. operations of the video-sharing app TikTok, people familiar with the matter said, beating out Microsoft Corp. MSFT +1.90% in a high-profile deal to salvage a social-media sensation that has been caught in the middle of a geopolitical standoff.

Oracle is set to be announced as TikTok’s “trusted tech partner” in the U.S., and the deal is likely not to be structured as an outright sale, the people said.

The next step is for the White House and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. to approve the deal, said one of the people, adding that the participants believe it satisfies the concerns around data security that have been previously raised by the U.S. government.

On Monday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed that his office received a bid proposal from Oracle for TikTok’s operations over the weekend and said that the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. would review it this week.

“We will be reviewing that at the CFIUS committee this week and then will be making a recommendation to the president and reviewing it with him,” Mr. Mnuchin said on CNBC. “From our standpoint, we’ll need to make sure that the code is, one, secure, Americans’ data is secure, that the phones are secure and we’ll be looking to have discussions with Oracle over the next few days with our technical teams.”

Mr. Mnuchin also said the Oracle deal includes a commitment to establish TikTok as a global company headquartered in the U.S., which he said would mean 20,000 new jobs.

The Treasury secretary said he wouldn’t go into all the details of the plan, but clarified that the deadline for the sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations is Sept. 20.

The move by TikTok’s parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., comes days after the Chinese government threw negotiations into doubt when it issued new export restrictions late last month on the kind of artificial intelligence technology TikTok uses. The algorithms, which determine the videos served to users and are seen as TikTok’s secret sauce, were considered part of the deal negotiations up until the Chinese policy change raising questions among the parties involved in negotiations over how to value the social-media business.

The structure of Oracle’s deal wasn’t immediately known, including whether it includes transfer of the algorithms.

Two people familiar with the Oracle deal said it was more appropriate to call it a partnership, rather than an acquisition, suggesting that there wasn’t an exchange of significant assets. At least some of ByteDance’s existing investors, including U.S. investment firms Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic, will get stakes in the venture as part of the deal, said people familiar with the matter.

The possibility that a deal might not involve an outright sale was previously reported by The Wall Street Journal.

President Trump has said repeatedly that he would shut down TikTok in the U.S. if it isn’t sold to an American company. In an Aug. 6 executive order, the White House gave ByteDance a 45-day deadline before it would ban the app, which the Trump administration says poses an economic and national-security threat to U.S. interests, if it isn’t sold to a U.S. buyer.

Microsoft, which had teamed up with Walmart Inc., earlier Sunday said in a statement that it was notified earlier in the day of the decision by ByteDance.

“We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok’s users, while protecting national security interests,” the statement said. “To do this, we would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combatting disinformation, and we made these principles clear in our August statement.”

DOES ORACLE’S WINNING BID AVERT A BAN?

A look at the state of play for the video app’s ownership and the prospects for a deal.

In a statement late Sunday, Walmart suggested it is considering joining the Oracle group, saying it is continuing “discussions with ByteDance leadership and other interested parties.”

While China’s recently announced trade restrictions made acquiring TikTok’s algorithm tricky, Microsoft remained committed to acquiring the app’s powerful suggestion algorithms, said a person familiar with the matter. Without outright purchase of the algorithms, Microsoft wouldn’t be able to follow through with its stated commitment to national security issues.

Oracle’s interest in TikTok is primarily driven by kick-starting its fledgling cloud-computing business, which remains far behind market leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft, people familiar with the matter said.

Microsoft’s plans were more ambitious than Oracle, said one person. Owning TikTok would help Microsoft have more presence among everyday consumers, an area it had mostly abandoned to chase after corporate users with the exception of its Xbox gaming business. TikTok would also give Microsoft a treasure trove of data on young and mostly female users, an area it doesn’t have much insight into now.

The New York Times reported earlier that Microsoft had been notified of the ByteDance decision.

TikTok has soared to around 100 million monthly users in the U.S., from about 11 million in early 2018, and they are considered among the most lucrative in the app’s global user base of about 689 million, though the app still loses money.

Oracle wasn’t as obvious a winner in the race for TikTok as Microsoft. While both tech companies have sizable cloud-computing operations and technical capabilities, Oracle is mainly focused on serving business clients and has virtually no experience running a social-media platform or other major consumer-facing business. Microsoft is an even bigger player in business computing but also owns the LinkedIn social-media site and the Xbox videogame business. It also is a much bigger company and has about $136 billion of cash, some three times what Oracle has on hand.",74,0.91

2020-09-19 01:46:23,Story of how I tried to beat the market and failed,"I tried to beat the market and made just 2.8% in unrealized gains until now in the year 2020. Here's how that happened.

I invested a total of $65000 in stocks this year. I transferred money into my brokerage account in 16 installments, each time depositing anywhere from 1k to 10k. Instead of readily putting the deposited money into some kind of ETF like QQQ or SPY, I bought individual stocks like MSFT, AAPL, TEAM, BA, C, etc., without any homework at random times. Sometimes, I held cash waiting for the right time to buy something. During the covid-19 crash in march, I caught falling knife on couple of stocks like BA, C, BAC, etc. Due to those losses, I stopped investing for a couple of months exactly when the prices were at minimum of the year.

All of this lead to a significantly low % of returns on my investments. Recently, I calculated how much money I could have made if I immediately invested the deposited money on the same day into QQQ, ARKW, XSD, SPY, etc. and that revealed the bitter truth. QQQ would have given me 18%, ARKW 58%, XSD 14.8% and SPY 4.7%. I know what I did isn't smart. I want to know how can I feel less sad about this. 

Even after this realization, I tried to create my own ETF sort of thing with some proportions across individual stocks. For ex: AAPL 20%, MSFT 15%, AMZN 15%, NVDA 10%, a bunch of growth stocks at 1.5%, etc. When I backtested my ETF purchase across my deposit intervals, I found that I could have made 37.9% in returns. This higher percentage is stopping me from switching to QQQ. Although ARKW returned 58%, I don't want to put all my money in it because they rebalance their holdings every quarter and they hold TSLA and few other risky stocks at large proportions. Even though TSLA is doing very good now, I am concerned about using ARKW and not having stop-loss on TSLA holdings. If I can control my holdings, I can setup stop-loss and protect myself when risky stocks go down. The problem with my ETF is that it's difficult to maintain determined proportions and stop-loss orders. When I want to invest smaller amounts of money, I have to rely on fractional shares and my brokerage doesn't provide that, so I have to shift to Robinhood or other trading platform.

To determine ""top 3 market cap"" I used the Q1 values in [Financial Times' Global 500 list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization). Since the FT Global 500 list started in 1996, that is where I begin.

In my **Big 3 Portfolio**, I purchase $1000 worth of each that year's top 3 market capitalization companies at their Jan 1st open price.

In my **SPY Portfolio**, I purchase $3000 a year of SPY (S&P 500 tracking index, aka ""the market"") at it's Jan 1st open price.

Thus the total cash basis of 25 annual batches of $3000 is $75,000 for each portfolio.

I found that the Big 3 Portfolio beat the SPY portfolio by about **$34,281.34, 20.75% over the value of the final SPY Portfolio value.**

*IMPORTANT NOTES:*

* *After pulling all the data, I realized the faulty assumption of this study is that the FT500 market cap ranking is posted on January 1st to know which 3 companies to purchase for that year. I have no idea what day it was posted, and if the years before the FT500 went to quarterly rankings were later in the year it might be showing more in hindsight instead of foresight. In hindsight, I probably should have purchased the previous year's top picks those early years and the previous Q4 picks after the survey went quarterly. May do a version 2 along those lines at some point.*
* *I do not reinvest dividends. I may include that on a version 2.0.*
* *I used fractional shares (i.e. however many shares you could have purchased with exactly $1000). That might not have been possible when this started but is possible now.*
* *This assumes no additional buying or selling. Another analysis worth doing might consider selling companies that drop out of the top 3 on the last day of the year and buying the new ones taking their place with the profits you have built up so far. This would keep you from holding companies like GE and Exxon as they decline and likely lead to bigger returns, I'd guess.*

The annual Big 3 lot beat the annual SPY lot long-term 19 out of 25 years. This is very heavily indebted to Microsoft offsetting many years of Exxon and GE being top 3 companies which are now in major decline. On the individual stock side, it wasn't nearly as lopsided: 38 of 75 batches beat $1000 worth of SPY purchased on the same day, 37 did not. As we slip into the past decade, that number drops drastically, with 25 batches outperforming the market and 8 underperforming it.

Microsoft (21 years), Apple (11 years) Amazon (2 years) and Google (3 years) beat the matching SPY lot every single year it made the list.

Exxon (19 years), GE (13 years), Cisco (1 year), Chevron (1 year), Wal-mart (1 year) and Coca-Cola (1 year) lost to the SPY lot every single year they made the list.

Berkshire split, with one year beating the market and one year losing to it.

I've been wanting to put some money into Microsoft but was never really sure. They have been churning out some, in my opinion, really nice products like the Surface, creating their own phone line, and most recently the Band (watch), which priced at $200 seems like it would generate a healthy interest and sales.
I missed the recent dip in MSFT, but I always was looking for a bigger drop so I still haven't put anything in. Currently it's at 52-week highs at around $47. 
Was wondering if you guys think it is a good time to buy still and think it will keep rising and not to bother waiting for a dip? Or that it may be too high to get in now and I should wait a bit? 
Also, a sort of unrelated question. With the end to U.S. government bond buying, anyone know how it would affect the overall U.S. stocks economy?

Stock is now back down to almost the same level it was after earnings were reported; now the next quarterly earnings report is around the corner and I'm wondering if the stock will dip again and if I should sell and buy APPL (which I've been contemplating since i bought MSFT). 

APPL Pitch: Honestly I think the apple watch is a pointless product but knowing people who buy apple products this does not matter. Would like to start a position before it's release and before APPL raises the dividend in April. Also predicting more killer Iphone sales numbers in China this quarter.

2020-08-31 14:09:52,When will the market crash? Asking for a friend...,"Serious, I'd like to hear from you what you think is the marker of a market wide correction... or a crash to come.   Personally, I really thought the AAPL TSLA stock split was it.  I expected a correction across most of NASDAQ today.   The valuation run up after the split-announcement and before the actual split (today) was incredible... and IMHO... unwarranted.  I predicted (incorrectly) that profiteers were looking to sell off after the split and there could be a considerable sell off today.  I thought the fact that today was the last day of the month might be a catalyst of a sell off.  Perhaps ETF and Mutual Fund adjustments resulted in pulling AAPL and TSLA up, not down.  
I'm not a bear, or bearish.  I'm holding these because I felt they both have legs for the long run but the recent run up has me nervous and I believe large sectors are oversold (starting with FAANG, including all EVs).  


I'm a private investor.  A day trader (more of a week trader) of sorts.  I'm diversified.  I don't need advice on what to buy, or sell.  I'm more interested in discussing the next large swing of the market.  
Looking forward, unemployment is up but hasn't taken hold of the markets yet.  Unemployment benefits were chopped in half.   15MM+ renters are behind in rent.  Consumer spending is at an all time low.  I know I know the stocks going up don't depend (directly) on consumer spending but where does FAANG stop?  I predicted 10% above Feb 1, 2020 values was the ceiling.  We are well beyond that.  


I'll offer my prediction in exchange for yours.  I have no tacit data to support my thinking but here it is.  FAANG will get a correction somewhere along the line.  Not a crash.  Maybe a 10-15% drop from ATH.  That correction will stop this bull run and with everyone declaring tech as 'oversold' FAANG et all will hang at a stagnant value into perpetuity.   I offer MSFT from 2001 to 2012 as an example.   After the tech-crash of 2001, MSFT was 'stuck' at $35 for over 10 years.   10 years of steady improvements in customer base, product diversity, and increasing revenues but investors couldn't seem to care.  


Retail investors (who all suffer from ADD) will flock to other sectors while waiting for the next tech-bull-run to start.  It will be hard to start if MSFT, AAPL, GOOG can't sustain growth of cloud and retail sales.  But the customers (business and private customers) who buy these products will cool off as they themselves struggle with reduced revenues (see consumer spending).  It's election time and FB and others are enjoying increased ad revenue that will vaporize in Nov.  


But when?  Man... I don't know.  Assuming this run is caused by retail investors, perhaps the harbinger will be the fund managers who declare 'enough' and boldly exit.  Maybe when BRK.A sells all it's MSFT or maybe when ARK divests from TSLA or ??",0,0.48
