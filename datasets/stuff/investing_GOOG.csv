Plans to File Antitrust Charges Against Google in Coming Weeks,"[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/us/politics/google-antitrust-justice-department.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/us/politics/google-antitrust-justice-department.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)

Key Excerpts:

&#x200B;

>The Justice Department plans to bring an antitrust case against Google as soon as this month, after Attorney General William P. Barr overruled career lawyers who said they needed more time to build a strong case against one of the world’s wealthiest, most formidable technology companies, according to five people briefed on internal department conversations.  
>  
>Justice Department officials told lawyers involved in the antitrust inquiry into Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, to wrap up their work by the end of September, according to three of the people. Most of the 40-odd lawyers who had been working on the investigation opposed the deadline. Some said they would not sign the complaint, and several of them left the case this summer.

&#x200B;

>Brianna Herlihy, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined to comment on the continuing investigation. Jose Castaneda, a spokesman for Google, said that the company would “continue to engage with ongoing investigations” and that its business practices enabled “increased choice and competition.”

&#x200B;

>The Justice Department amassed powerful evidence of anticompetitive practices, three people said.  
>  
>But the lawyers also described internal politics that at times slowed down the department’s work or drove a wedge among members of the team.

&#x200B;

>For nearly a year, dozens of Justice Department lawyers and other staff members worked in two groups, each overseeing a separate line of inquiry: Google’s dominance in search and its control over many aspects of the ecosystem for online advertising.

&#x200B;

>Google controls about 90 percent of web searches globally, and rivals have complained that the company extended its dominance by making its search and browsing tools defaults on phones with its Android operating system. Google also captures about one-third of every dollar spent on online advertising, and its ad tools are used to supply and auction ads that appear across the internet.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Antitrust scrutiny of Big Tech seems to have picked up with Google in the Trump Administrations crosshairs. Despite broad bipartisan support in Congress and amongst 50 state AGs, there seems to be some politicking, or at least the appearance of such, that could slow down the government's case. AG Barr wants to file charge against Google by the end of September.",1655,0.98

That gap feels large to me. Also, FB is valued at $760B with much lower revenue and decelerating growth, so its gap vs GOOG seems small. 

Is GOOG a good buy? Are these other companies just overvalued? Curious what you all think.  
Here's my thinking:

* GOOG has rock-solid fundamentals - excellent gross margins, has maintained \~15%+ YoY revenue growth even at their scale, and search is a steady business with many entrypoints across the Google ecosystem
* GOOG has bets across so many forward-looking industries that I think they will be able to diversify over time and don't have real risk of not continuing to innovate. There's of course the risk of anti-trust and privacy regulations, but that's been true for years now (although things do appear to be ratcheting up).
* It seems their stock hasn't mooned during covid because a meaningful share of search volume (and subsequently search revenue) comes from brick-and-mortar businesses (as opposed to someone like FB, whose ads biz is more of an ecommerce/direct-to-consumer play), which puts a drag on their revenue. This was the main reason for their relatively weak Q2 earnings a couple weeks back.

2021-01-31 17:40:45,Markets Look Like They’re in a Bubble. What Do Investors Do Now?,"WSJ Article Below! What is everyone's thought on this?  Ever since the markets recovered from the crash in March, I find all stocks are overpriced but I don't know if this means that we're in bubble. Could just mean investors are optimistic? 

Article starts here:

Markets Look Like They’re in a Bubble. What Do Investors Do Now?

For once, everyone seems to agree: Much of the market looks like it’s in a bubble.

Shares of unprofitable companies like GameStop Corp. GME 67.87% and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. AMC 53.65% are rising at a breakneck pace, propelled by a growing army of individual investors. Options activity is surging, bitcoin prices are near records and businesses are rushing to opportunistically sell stock through a flurry of initial public offerings, listings of blank-check companies and follow-on share sales.

To many, valuations look stretched as they hover at levels similar to the highflying days of 2000. That said, high valuations alone don’t necessarily mean the rally is near its end, investors say. History has shown that markets have often been able to climb far longer than thought possible, be it the dot-com boom in the late 1990s or the dizzying rise in Japanese stocks in the 1980s.

And recently, the broader stock market has been on the decline. The S&P 500 dropped 3.3% last week, though it remains up 66% from its March low. The bubblelike behavior there has mostly been contained to a handful of individual stocks, not larger indexes.

Single-Stock Bubbles

Fast-moving stocks such as GameStop, AMC Entertainment Holdings and BlackBerry have raised concerns of excessive exuberance in pockets of the market, while the S&P 500 largely remains unchanged.

An even bigger issue arguing against a marketwide bubble is simple math. With interest rates at rock bottom and further stimulus on the table, many investors are being handsomely rewarded by putting their money into riskier, higher-yielding assets. What’s more, in many cases earnings have held up or been robust, despite a global pandemic.

That combination of factors has helped push investor optimism. Bullishness on stocks among money managers is at a three-year high, according to a recent Bank of America survey of 194 money managers who oversee $561 billion in assets. Meanwhile, the average share of cash in portfolios—typically a safeguard against market turmoil—is at the lowest level since May 2013.

Nonetheless, investors are trying to identify what could cause bubbles among individual stocks to pop and whether any of the bursts will spread to the wider market. Next week, investors will get a look at fresh data on the manufacturing sector, earnings from Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -0.97% and Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG -1.47% and the January employment report.

“You know, this one has checked off all the boxes from a history book,” said Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of Boston money manager Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Co., who predicted the market crashes of 2000 and 2008. Mr. Grantham has been calling the current market overheated since last year.

But even he concedes the timing of a market top is difficult.

“We know each bubble is a little bit different and, with the help of new trading platforms and the internet, it could set more records,” he said.

Mr. Grantham isn’t alone in his worries. Nearly 90% of some 627 market professionals think some financial markets are in a bubble, according to a recent Deutsche Bank survey. Meanwhile, Google searches for the term “stock market bubble” reached an all-time high in January.

Jerry Braakman, chief investment officer of First American Trust, says his company, concerned about stretched valuations in the U.S., has been gradually shifting more money into stocks elsewhere.

Lately, “the market has not been correlated to the macro picture,” he said.

New Year Anxieties

Google searches for 'stock market bubble' reached an all-time high in January.

While the moves of some stocks and assets have been jarring, analysts and investors say they aren’t surprised by the freewheeling, speculative activity in the financial markets.

A super-accommodative Federal Reserve, low interest rates and, more recently, optimism on the coronavirus vaccine and economy have underpinned much of the buying by investors during the past 11 months. Many Americans built up their savings during the pandemic—and stand to gain even more if Congress follows through on another stimulus package. And the prospect of low returns in most other assets has driven investors to buy stocks more aggressively.

Add to that, more individual investors are trading than ever before. Those investors threw their weight around last year by shocking Wall Street veterans with a rash of irrational stock picks, including Hertz Global Holdings Inc., HTZGQ 7.36% which spiked nearly 900% from its low to its high in the wake of filing for bankruptcy protection.

This year’s encores have been even more stunning. On Wednesday alone, 24.5 billion shares and 57.1 million options contracts changed hands, a record driven by individual investors, according to Rich Repetto, a managing director in Piper Sandler & Co. GameStop shares more than doubled that day, briefly giving shares of the beleaguered videogame retailer a more than 1,700% gain since the year’s start.

“This is merely one example of what’s becoming dozens of dozens,” Mr. Grantham said. Other retail darlings include AMC, which jumped more than 300% Wednesday, and BlackBerry Ltd. , whose stock the same day notched its biggest gain in more than 17 years.

The Blank-Check Boom Poses Pitfalls for Investors

The Blank-Check Boom Poses Pitfalls for Investors

Private companies are flooding to special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, to bypass the traditional IPO process and gain a public listing. WSJ explains why some critics say investing in these so-called blank-check companies isn’t worth the risk. Illustration: Zoë Soriano/WSJ

Companies are rushing to get in on the action.

Companies have raised $13.4 billion through 24 IPOs so far this year, a 300% jump in listings from the same period last year, according to Renaissance Capital data. Blank-check companies continued to flood the market, with 91 gathering about $25 billion, nearly a third of the value raised throughout all of last year, according to SPACinsider.com. And there have been 111 offerings of additional shares by U.S.-listed companies, doubling the number from the same period a year earlier, Dealogic data show.

Usually, such frenzied activity would lead big money managers to pull back from stocks. But many argue that shares of GameStop, AMC and other highflying stocks represent their own bubbles—and don’t pose a threat to the entire financial ecosystem. Analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS -1.40% say the run-up in unprofitable stocks, which they say make up about 5% of the overall market, poses little risk of contagion.

“These stocks don’t make up the bulk of the stock market,” said Samantha McLemore, a portfolio manager at $3.5 billion money-manager Miller Value Partners. “There are so many areas of the market that we’re finding attractively valued.”

At first glance, investors’ go-to for measuring valuations, price-to-earnings ratios, suggests the market looks expensive.

The S&P 500 currently trades at 22 times projected earnings during the next 12 months, not far off from the 25 times the index traded at in 2000, just before the dot-com crash, according to FactSet.

But that’s only part of the picture. That level looks less concerning once low interest rates and earnings, which are expected to grow, are factored in, several investors and analysts said.

One simple explanation for why investors haven’t pulled back more?

“We’ve seen it in the past—if you think you have a bubble and sell too soon, that can be a very costly trade,” said Mr. Braakman of First American Trust.

NVDA - 3%

AMZN- 7%
GOOG - 18%

I have been holding some GOOG shares since it was at ~840 and yesterday I added 6 more. And once I get more money, I am actually thinking of increasing my position even more.

I am not good at evaluating companies but when I look around GOOG is slowly taking over and there is still so much potential growth. 

1). Data - Google has so much data. It is INSANE. They know about billions of humans and their behavior, business, streets, pictures (with google photos) It is absolutely nuts. which brings me to my next two point (AI and Cars)

2). AI - we know that AI is going to be a huge part of our everyday life going forward. And with the amount of data GOOGLE has, they are on the TOP spot to leverage and make their AI the best. This isn't even an opinion right? FB, Microsoft, and Amazon doesn't even have fraction of data that Google has. And AI is all about machine learning, and the more data you feed, smarter it gets. 

3). Automobile- This is uncharted territory, no one has been able to penetrate and challenge the big car giants like GM, Toyota, Audi etc. Once Elon Musk was asked a question, who does he see as his competitor and his answer was Apple. I don't know if he was being ignorant or genuinely don't see Google as a major competitor.    

Google's approach to automobile is same as their approach to Android. They do what they do the best (create software and services) and let the hardware people make the hardware. Seems like they are on the same path with cars, they are creating the best selfdriving system and infrastructure and just going to sell this to other car manufactures, who already know how to build cars. And just like Pixel line up, we might see cars made by Google at some point. But the thing is, how can anyone not see Google as a serious competitor is beyond my understanding. 

I still haven't talked about their new silicon initiative and IoT stuff. Its safe to say, it all looks very promising to me

2016-10-07 01:25:58,A $25bn Snapchat IPO? Look at FB / GOOG's IPO data for insight.,"Here's the [WSJ story](http://www.wsj.com/articles/snapchat-parent-working-on-ipo-that-could-value-company-at-25-billion-or-more-sources-1475778314) with the following figures:

|Snapchat|2015A|2016E|2017E|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $60m | $250-350m | ~$1bn |

## GOOG

So what did Google look like in it's early years?

|Google|1999A|2000A|2001A|2002A|2003A|2004A|2005A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $0m | $19m | $86m | $440m | $1,466m|$3,189m | $6,139m|

The IPO was in August 2004. It was values at $23bn in the IPO.

## FB

Next let's look at Facebook, whose IPO was in May 2012 valuing the business at $81bn

|Facebook|2009A|2010A|2011A|2012A|2013A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $777m | $1,974m | $3,711m | $5,089m | $7,872m|

## Well?

Both Facebook and Google were profitable at the time of their IPOs and they had shown an acceleration in their revenue growth. This got them 5 to 10x next year's forecast revenue, and 7 to 16x current year's forecast revenue. 

For me the key is proof that the topline in accelerating. Google's top line accelerated every year until the great recession. Facebook's stopped immediately after the IPO, crashing the stock, until the topline started ramping again in 2013.

## A Rocket or Rock?

If Snapchat's sales follow this path, then a $25bn will be a steal. If not, it'll be another Twitter.

|Snapchat|2015A|2016E|2017E|2018E|2019E|2020E|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $60m | $300m | $1bn |$2bn |$3.5bn |$6bn |




## EDIT:

If you're curious on the stats for Twitter, it IPOed in Nov 2013. It's sales had been accelerating. The business was valued at $14bn, i.e. 10x the forecast year's sales.

|Twitter|2010A|2011A|2012A|2013A|2014A|2015A|

Back of the hand calculation for the weighted average P/E ratio of those index leaders from a month ago is: **175.2**, and it's even higher now largely due to Tesla. P/E is high even without Tesla at a weighted average of **58.2**.

2021-01-12 23:34:47,Buying at the ATH/FOMO," I heard today that more often than not, a stock produces the best gains when people buy at its current all time high. I was wondering what everyone's experience is with this. I don't have FOMO when I buy long-term stocks like AAPL, MSFT, etc. since I'm sure they'll still provide steady gains for years to come. However, I'm more iffy on other stocks that have reached their all time highs, as I worry that it won't produce much more than it has. Take ETSY for example. I planned on buying a share yesterday morning with my $200, since they were at about $183. Then I saw in the pre-market that it shot up to about $206. So I bought a share of Disney instead, since I'm more confident in them in the long-term. My question is, are most people confident in these growth stocks like ETSY to continue shooting up and constantly breaking their ATH? I'm still learning how to do all my proper research on companies and industries, but I don't see them turning into the next GOOG or AMZN or anything. As a result, it makes me feel like I wouldn't see as many gains with this stock. I don't have enough money to buy multiple shares, and I wouldn't want to buy one share of a company and only make about $50 when I could've bought more shares of a cheaper stock for more gains. It's not so much that I have FOMO with growth stocks, it's more like fear of not maximizing potential gains. Thoughts?",0,0.5

Love to hear the feedback on the 3 rules of thumb:

* Rule number 1: watch for the hype
* Rule number 2: expect zero shares at the IPO price
* Rule number 3: think long term not short

2017-05-23 16:08:56,Engineer here: this is how you analyze GOOG as a quant,"A few weeks ago I started trying to find undervalued companies and invest in them. This lead me to two stocks $GBX and $CTB. Well, $CTB and value investing in general turned out to be a huge turd so I *liquidated my position*. This freed up some cash to try new ideas. 

I've decided to switch from value investing to becoming a quant. Now from what I can tell, the details are scarce, quants do a lot of statistics calculations on stocks. As a learning exercise I used google sheets to analyze a stock everyone loves: $GOOG.

Here is the [spreadsheet] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vJFb-DXU68phDNs3kVzpyGupHTFs_zgaxqzrcikCPrI/) where I calculate some commonly used statistic functions manually and compare it with the excel result. I wouldn't be a good engineer if the results weren't checked to be exactly the same.

These are the quantities computed:

* mean 843.0914433
* standard deviation 42.96703245
* covariance (to S&P500) 1366.739769
* correlation (to S&P500) 0.7318863498
* beta (to S&P500) 0.7235560557

**AMZN** jumped so much because it's actually expanding its business through their own delivery system (like you might've seen some prime-labelled vehicles parked on your street), and people increased their online buying habits while not going out, so its price grew a lot during this few months, which I believe is justified.

2020-09-30 15:31:55,Monopolies and Peter Lynch on Beating the Market,"Hi all, this is just my personal opinion, let's get straight to the point:

Although most people don't realize it, there are monopolies all around us. I'm going to specifically focus on tech companies as they produce the highest returns (as far as I'm aware) and tech is the industry that I'm most familiar with (from real life), but this should also apply to any industry.

When I'm saying ""monopoly"", I don't refer to the economic definition of"" a company that's actively preventing competition"", but rather to the more lose definition by Investopedia of ""when a company and its product offerings dominate a sector or industry"". Also, we'll be focusing only on the US market and US  companies. General knowledge: ""a market share of greater than 50% has been necessary for courts to find the existence of monopoly power."" According to the US Department of Justice, so we'll go off of that 50% rule.

&#x200B;

Take Google, for example, a monopoly on search engines. According to an article from Visual Capitalist (published on Business Insider), Google and YouTube handle more than 90% of all internet searches (YouTube is owned by Google). Realistically speaking that's a monopoly.

Look at Amazon and the exact same things happen with e-commerce. According to marketer.com, Amazon has a 38.7% US market share. While this is certainly not above 50%, Amazon is still the most dominant player in online retail in the US by a huge margin.

Apple is without argument a ""monopoly"" on the US phone and (potentially) computer market. 

Microsoft is the outlier here because we're looking at it on a global scale but we can see according to statista.com, that it has a 72.9% Global market share of operating systems, thus it has a global monopoly on it.

So my analysis is not perfect, but you also have to remember that each company is well established, with good historical returns (stock wise, and I'm assuming income wise as well), and they all have a multitude of income sources.

&#x200B;

""Alright alright, you've made your point, so now what?"":

So let's assume that I believe that long-term these ""monopolies"" will remain as the dominant players, and because of that and other factors (believing in the company for example), I want to invest in them and only in them (assume GOOG, AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, 25% of the portfolio each).

Often people will say that diversification is an issue with an all tech portfolio, but backtesting for the past 15 years (which isn't that short) shows that tech simply beats the market. That leads me to the second part of the title about Peter Lynch. Lynch has said that ""in order to beat the index, you just take the worst performers out"". Sometimes this will come with more risk, sometimes not. So my question to you is, ignoring the debate about diversification, is there something else that I'm missing?

Here is a screenshot of the backtesting results, assuming you started with $10,000, rebalanced annually, and reinvested dividends. You can even see that the tech portfolio (Portfolio 2) has presumably less risk due to a higher shrape ratio of the SP500 (Portfolio 1): [i.imgur.com/tZl63Ej.png](https://i.imgur.com/tZl63Ej.png)

Thanks for any answers, I'll be happy to take questions as well.

EDIT:
A lot of people say that I've fallen prey to a bias of picking the best performers and then saying in hindsight why they were successful. So we found that the best performers are also tech monopolies (big deal). We also know in hindsight that these companies share (the same) other traits of success (like good revenue), but that's usually a by-product of the monopoly. Now, is it not reasonable to assume that if something is a tech monopoly that it'll play a big part in its success?
If that's a reasonable assumption, then the 4 companies I chose should (for the most part) continue being successful until their status as a monopoly, or something else that's drastic enough (like government intervention) will change. Also, I focus on tech because that's the field I'm most knowledgeable in, which by chance happens to be the be performing sector. I only want to invest in companies I understand.

EDIT 2:
For people saying that ""the returns on these companies aren’t good because they started out as monopolies, they started out small and grew to their position today, thus the high returns."" - Google already had a 56.3% market share in 2007 (digitalsuregeons.com), Amazon I'm pretty sure was always the significant player in US online retail (eBay is auctions not online retail, but still have been passed by Amazon), Apple had the most market share for a single company already in 2014 (Forbes), and Microsoft had a near 100% OS global market share already in 2010 (statista.com) and it even dropped a bit but their stock's performance is still great. Please note that these values fluctuate but it proves that except for apple, most of the backtesting period shows returns from times that these companies were already monopolies.",17,0.7

2020-08-18 21:32:15,My Tesla Valuation,"This valuation will hold weight under the following assumptions:

1. Global automakers need remain competitive.
2. Increasing difficulty to scale (50% growth rate is unsustainable forever).
3. Current production plans.

Currently, it is estimated that there will be around 31.1 million EV sales by 2030, 32% of the automobile market. 

With estimation of all current factory projects to achieve completion and be fully ramped up, Tesla should be able to achieve 7.7 million EV output (assuming 500,000/86 hectares of land - Giga Shanghai). 

As it stands, Tesla can reach 24% market share of the addressable EV market, 8% of the automotive market. The automotive market is projected to be worth 6.7 trillion in a highly disruptive scenario. Assuming inflation grows at 2.2% per annum, it should be valued at 5.389 trillion today. Tesla's valuation should therefore be $431 billion.

Moving forward, Tesla faces the following challenges:

1) Lack of well-priced products for developing markets

None of Tesla's current cars will make it in the Indian and S.E.A market unless locally manufactured. A Tesla Model 3 with no additional features costs 11 times more than a Maruti Alto in India. It also costs 4.37 times more than LCGC in Indonesia.

2) Difficulty for it's solar business to enter non-American regions due to abundance of high rise accommodation.

TLDR: $2312/share, $462.4/share (post-split)

2020-08-17 21:06:29,Analysis of Scion Asset Management 13-F Filing,"I am not one to typically follow or pay attention to the investing of those that consider themselves ""professionals"", but when it comes to the man, the myth, the legend, Dr. Michael Burry, I do. Recently, his fund, Scion Asset Management, filed it's 13-F Filing and there was some interesting information in it. (Bear in mind, some of these positions could be a few months old, however since I am focusing on the call options in his portfolio many of these positions would most likely be long-term and therefore would still be valid investments). Of note, Burry had 16 call positions which represented 71.19% of his portfolio. I would suspect that these are LEAP options (at least one year options) and not short-term call options, which clearly shows that he believes the economy has seen the worst of the coronavirus and is poised for a recovery. The reason I suspect Burry is invested in LEAP options is due to their tendency to be mispriced and cheaper than holding a higher priced stock like GOOG or BKNG long-term. They would offer far more upside than just holding the stock itself. We also know from history that Michael Burry is not a short-term investor and his ""Big Short"" positions, which were also derivatives, took over one year to profit. With that in mind here are the companies that made up the biggest positions in his call options:

GOOG (36% of his portfolio)

FB (7%)

BKNG (6%)

GS (5%)

WDC (4%)

Various other companies made up his other positions which primarily consisted of energy, retail, gaming (casino) and financial companies. All these companies are in sectors which are market laggards currently, but would increase dramatically with a market recovery, hence his use of call options. From looking at his portfolio, it is evident Michael Burry is bullish on the market and believes that it is set to recover. He is clearly betting on higher interest rates in the future (financial stocks), higher energy prices (energy stocks), higher consumer spending (retail stocks), increased discretionary spending (casino/gaming/travel stocks), and overall increase in the dominant tech stocks (FB/GOOG). I think this is a solid portfolio and thesis. I am not one to argue with the legend and I will be following his lead into some of the stocks he has bought. Specifically GOOG, WYNN, LVS, JPM, BAC, GS calls.

2014-04-16 11:28:58,A new discussion re dilution in GOOG vs GOOGL,"Recently, our GOOG shares were halved in value, renamed GOOGL and then new shares of GOOG were given to each of us on a 1 to 1 basis.  Much has been said of this split, but the one thing that I would like to know is why people wouldn't all ditch their GOOG for GOOGL right now, while they are close to parity?  

Don't get me wrong- I dont' care about voting rights that I get through GOOGL shares.  It's nice and all, but I'm a small time investor. And while I may fill out a proxy form now and again, my paltry shares aren't about to change this ship's heading anytime soon.  

What I do care about is future valuation.  Ignoring class B shares entirely, it is my understanding that 1/2 of the value of the company remained in GOOGL, and the other half was ""assigned"" to the new GOOG.  For this reason, they have come out of the gates trading fairly close to each other.    

But in the future, [Google's purchasing power](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Google) is said to come from both cash and from GOOG stock.  

Let's take this week's deal with Titan Aerospace.  I don't believe the specifics have been printed yet, but let's say the company is bought for X million dollars and Y shares of Google's stock.  That stock would be newly issued GOOG stock.  And that would do what this split intended, it would dilute the class C shares and maintain the class A/ shares as they were.  

So over time, wouldn't the class B shares be worth less and less compared to the non-diluted shares of GOOGL?  If that's the case, then aren't we better off buying a stable %age of the company instead of buying the part of the half of the company that will continue to be diluted after every single takeover?

2020-08-31 14:09:52,When will the market crash? Asking for a friend...,"Serious, I'd like to hear from you what you think is the marker of a market wide correction... or a crash to come.   Personally, I really thought the AAPL TSLA stock split was it.  I expected a correction across most of NASDAQ today.   The valuation run up after the split-announcement and before the actual split (today) was incredible... and IMHO... unwarranted.  I predicted (incorrectly) that profiteers were looking to sell off after the split and there could be a considerable sell off today.  I thought the fact that today was the last day of the month might be a catalyst of a sell off.  Perhaps ETF and Mutual Fund adjustments resulted in pulling AAPL and TSLA up, not down.  
I'm not a bear, or bearish.  I'm holding these because I felt they both have legs for the long run but the recent run up has me nervous and I believe large sectors are oversold (starting with FAANG, including all EVs).  


I'm a private investor.  A day trader (more of a week trader) of sorts.  I'm diversified.  I don't need advice on what to buy, or sell.  I'm more interested in discussing the next large swing of the market.  
Looking forward, unemployment is up but hasn't taken hold of the markets yet.  Unemployment benefits were chopped in half.   15MM+ renters are behind in rent.  Consumer spending is at an all time low.  I know I know the stocks going up don't depend (directly) on consumer spending but where does FAANG stop?  I predicted 10% above Feb 1, 2020 values was the ceiling.  We are well beyond that.  


I'll offer my prediction in exchange for yours.  I have no tacit data to support my thinking but here it is.  FAANG will get a correction somewhere along the line.  Not a crash.  Maybe a 10-15% drop from ATH.  That correction will stop this bull run and with everyone declaring tech as 'oversold' FAANG et all will hang at a stagnant value into perpetuity.   I offer MSFT from 2001 to 2012 as an example.   After the tech-crash of 2001, MSFT was 'stuck' at $35 for over 10 years.   10 years of steady improvements in customer base, product diversity, and increasing revenues but investors couldn't seem to care.  


Retail investors (who all suffer from ADD) will flock to other sectors while waiting for the next tech-bull-run to start.  It will be hard to start if MSFT, AAPL, GOOG can't sustain growth of cloud and retail sales.  But the customers (business and private customers) who buy these products will cool off as they themselves struggle with reduced revenues (see consumer spending).  It's election time and FB and others are enjoying increased ad revenue that will vaporize in Nov.  


But when?  Man... I don't know.  Assuming this run is caused by retail investors, perhaps the harbinger will be the fund managers who declare 'enough' and boldly exit.  Maybe when BRK.A sells all it's MSFT or maybe when ARK divests from TSLA or ??",0,0.46

I am looking for more ""tech"" and I like VGT low fees (0.1) and more holdings (300+) but I don't like how 40% of VGT is AAPL+MSFT. QQQ top holdings are more evenly dispersed. Having hundreds of holdings of miniscule % like VGT also doesn't seem like it makes much difference tbh. I also like how QQQ has other tech-ish stocks like AMZN, GOOG, TSLA, etc., making it more diverse, sector-wise. 

Performance of these are pretty close and go back and forth in the past decade. I've done a ton of searching on comparison of these two. One thing I have yet to find is how DRIP and expense ratio factor in. I was hoping to find a calculator that charts overall returns of 2 portfolios based on varying dividend and expense ratio (keeping performance equal). I am trying to figure out how much dividend (QQQ 0.59%; VGT 0.98%) and ER should factor into my decision on which to choose long-term. Also would be interesting if a calculator also factored in actual historical returns + reinvest dividends + ER. (I read somewhere that QQQ is not DRIP-eligible? What does this mean exactly.)

Have  I *actually* added any meaningful diversification?

2020-09-01 22:12:21,Individual stocks in taxable account or Roth IRA?,"I've been dumping money into target index funds and index ETFs (70/30 US/International) for the past while. Thinking of allocating a small percentage (~5-10%) of my portfolio to purchasing some ""safe"" growth stocks with the intent to buy and hold. Thinking some subset of MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, FB, GOOG, but likely just the first two. Roth IRA seems like the better choice, since any gains would be tax free. I've run across advice that individual stocks should be in a taxable account, in case of the need to tax loss harvest. I see this as a low possibility of wiping out a good portion of my Roth contributions, so it may be worth the risk to put it there. I'm 25 years old so long ways from retirement and have ~15% of my portfolio in 401k.

What's the best option here: invest in taxable or Roth? Am I being stupid and should just continue dumping into index funds?",10,0.78

2020-02-24 20:48:01,Picking stocks based on personal consumption,"The other day someone mentioned to me that I was a bit frugal. That got me thinking about the relationship between my personal consumption and investment. I wondered whether it would be a good idea to invest in companies that I personally did business with. I figured that these companies would either have such a strong service/product or position in the market that a long-term investment would be justified. So I tested it. 

The first thing I had to do was determine the criteria which companies needed to meet to get a spot on my list. The following is what I decided upon:

* Purchases must be notable or recurring. Notable would be defined as single purchases exceeding $250. Recurring purchases would be purchases made at least once annually. *Edit: I am looking at my historical purchases from the period surrounding the beginning of the analysis, not current purchases*

* Companies will only be included on the list if I am able to associate their brand with their product or service. 

* Retailers will be included in cases where their brand is relevant to my patronage. 

* Companies must be public, Canadian or American(or indirectly available on either country's markets), and listed at the beginning of the modeled period.

After compiling a list of companies, I looked at the growth(or loss) they experienced over the last 5 years. In my model, I would invest approximately $1,000 into each of the listed companies, rounding to the nearest whole number to determine the number of shares purchased. For example, if I could buy 9.6 shares of $DIS with my $1,000 I would record an investment of 10 shares, while if I could buy 23.26 shares of $KO with my $1,000 I would record an investment of 23 shares.

**Observations** 

In both Canada and the United States, the stocks chosen based my consumption *crushed* the market indexes they were compared against. The American stocks saw >3x greater returns than the $SPY while the Canadian stocks saw >2x greater returns than the TSX. 

Only one chosen stock in each market saw a decrease in value over the modeled period. Across both markets, nine stocks more than doubled their value. A majority(56%) of chosen Canadian stocks outperformed the Canadian market over this period. A majority(58%) of chosen American stocks outperformed the American market over this period.

**Guesses**

If I had to guess, I would attribute the success of the chosen stocks to any combination of the following:

* Dominant position in their respective industry.

* Offering an essential product or service.

* Providing an innovative product or service. 

* Positive or improving brand perception

2020-05-14 23:32:40,"I started my career in November and investing February 5th, 2020 - my strategy as a once peasant Mexican","## My history investing in college and my first month investing in February:

Learned about miners and blockchain validation with a chemical engineering friend before the rally.

- Bought **XRP** at $.15 and $.25, sold at $3.28 (I valued at $4 or $5 dollars MAX in 10 years if blockchain found adoption)

- Bought **AMD** after the rally at $11 because it was ridiculous how much cost efficiency they had introduced to the market to poor people like me unlike **NVIDIA** products which always seemed far removed and discouraged me.

- I started with **Panasonic** because I had missed out on the window to invest in **Tesla** at 200-300 range. I believed **Panasonic** to be similar to **AMD's** relationship to **bitcoin**; while all eyes looked at the shiny object, I looked at the boring parts that built it.

- The market crashed, so I DCA'd aggressively and controlled my emotions through out. I was more concerned with my performance to commitment rather than my returns at the time. I did well.

- My investments in March 19 was **SQ** and **Lyft**

## My Strategy now that I have income

- I bought up to 5,000 dollars in stocks ranging from **FANUC** (industrial robotics) to **DENNYS** (logistics/real estate)

- I trimmed down to $2,300 but will rapidly rebuild with a different approach:

- I'm buying 1 stock in the company before making any further developments with. Following this, I will purchase ETFs in sectors that I **want** to see develop in the next 5-15 years. I will buy 1 stake into these ETFs and combine it with my 1 stock purchase to create the necessary offset.

- For example, I bought 1 stock of **Texas Instruments**  for $109 followed by a purchase in **SOXX ETF** for semiconductors, which has the largest ETF allocation to **Texas Instruments.** I will apply similar logic to companies like **Facebook, Paypal,** etc.

&#x200B;

- I do this ""1 chip"" start in multiple industries because I want to pick some arbitrary point in time but I have a lot of industries & ecosystems that I would like to reasonably participate in. This will still cost a lot of money to start off with and buys me time to study company numbers and outlooks.

&#x200B;

## My current market sentiment

- I consider where you start on a graph as somewhat arbitrary and see the current market stability as somewhat of an exercise in game theory and rowing a boat throat a thick fog. I believe it's optimal to row cautiously forward and to not stay still. With cautious rowing, you'll be able to react appropriately if you are suddenly met by a waterfall or a path with clearer vision.


- I value customer service a lot. Back in 2011 I would have said that investing in Blizzard was a good idea simply because they brought their servers down for 8 hours every Tuesday for almost a decade. They did this to ensure higher quality server maitenance in an era where online gaming was unknown territory. If I were to pick an airline, this would be my center of focus. This often means I need to participate in the market in order to invest in it. This is why Netflix beat Blockbuster in the early game and why Disney may win in the late.


&#x200B;



- I am **\`*****BEARISH\`*** on Amazon in the long term. I believe that slowly, but surely, the market will consume Amazon's hold on its markets. I don't believe Amazon will maintain the status quo on cloud computing due to the quality of its competitors. I absolutely LOVE **Google Cloud Platform** and utilize **Firebase real-time database** very often. **Microsoft** has made some extremely important acquisitions recently in **Github and NPM**. I wonder often how rapid Amazon systems will become maintenance and legacy based systems of a previous era of cloud software utilization.

- I'm currently building an edtech platform where the system records students effort in various ways and translates that effort into a donation pool. Teachers are provided a platform to share resources and utilize analytics. This is all done in real time with Google and Facebooks frameworks for frontend and Backend development. 



-  I have suspicions about **Amazon** will struggle internationally. I don't know if Amazon will penetrate China the way China does, or if it will succeed in locations south of Mexico against things like **Mercado Libre**



- I have suspicions that tech platforms will soon integrate in a meaningful way with financials. As in, the virtualization of stores and forwarded payments in places like the **Facebook(Visa) Market Place, Twitter(Square) payment sending, Paypal(honey) & Amazon purchasing, Gaming credits, etc.**



- I am \`**bullish**\` on Facebook. Facebook is utterly invaluable and scales globally. The reason it's adopted in **Mexico**, for example, is because it's cheaper and faster than other services. They also service millions of developers with **React** and its growing development ecosystem. They provide a standardized marketting platform for small businesses on Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and soon to be JIO. I would not be surprised if they soon enter the fintech sector.



- I am \`**bullish\`** on **Paypal**. They are seemingly repeating their previous success by servicing large online commerce that are upgrading their systems. **Honey/Paypal** will scrape coupons for Amazon and force organizations like Visa to compete with  **real-time financial services**.



&#x200B;



- I am **\`bullish\`** on cloud software and networking. I think **CDNs** and dedicated **services for Cybersecurity** will maintain. Sure Google provides these services but things like **Cloudflare** and **Fastly** have dedicated solutions to fast image processing, DDoS protection, and more that other platforms may not be able to **allocate their resources to**. **Cloudflare** has an enormous network, and **Fastly** provides a great system for you to enjoy content like **Reddit.** I think it's hard to miss the mark here - the highway of the internet is going to get faster and more assets will be maintained in the server's space - the ecosystem must grow with it.

&#x200B;



- I am **EXTREMELY BEARISH** on Beyond Meat. I've been vegetarian for 10 years. IT'S BAD. WE HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO BE EXCITED ABOUT AND WE'RE NOT USED TO HAVING ATTENTION. VEGETARIANS ARE LYING IF THEY SAY IT'S AMAZING. ***IT'S LITERALLY DOG FOOD***

&#x200B;



- I am \`**BULLISH\`** on the long term development of **Mexico**. I think companies like **Kansas City Southern** that services **Mexican-American** relationships will grow well in the long run.



- I am **\`BULLISH\`**  on Apple and Adobe. Amazing products.

2020-08-02 11:26:14,Portfolio Proposal (TechHeavy),"Hi guys! I’ve been tinkering around with a theoretical portfolio and planning to make it my majority holdings in the foreseeable future. Do chip in your thoughts about it!

AAPL - 5.57%
MSFT - 10.44%
AMZN - 9.52%
FB - 9.17%
GOOG - 6.91%
NVDA - 10.3%
ADBE - 13.54%
ASML - 9.07%
TSM - 7.48%
V - 9.35%
MA - 8.64%

I think majority of the stock selections are pretty mainstream, picked to mimic QQQ. I personally added TSM and ASML as I’m a strong believer in semiconductors going forward.

What differentiates the portfolio above and QQQ is the weights itself. Instead of adjusting it based on market cap, I’ve decided to optimise the weights above with a sole focus - to maximise Sortino Ratio.

Backtested portfolio since Sept 2012 vs QQQ:
CAGR - 36.71% vs 20.06%
StDev - 16.97% vs 14.97%
Best Year - 57.78% vs 38.96%
Worst Year - 5.52% vs -3.63%
Sortino Ratio - 4.17 vs 2.28

By analysing the numbers above, it’s basically a less diverse portfolio with 11 holdings, higher StdDev but significantly higher returns, and a much more efficient fund. Even the worst year for it is still a positive return.

QUESTION: I've found a lot of options calculators where I can pick a strike and date, and it'll give me profit/loss estimates based on the actual stock price some number of days out, usually using Black/Scholes models.

What I'm looking for is a calculator that takes into account current option prices across different strike prices and strike dates, where I can say,

""I think GOOG will be at 1500 on <date>, of all the available options chains, which would have the best ROI on <date>?""

Does such a thing exist?

&#x200B;

\---- Edit: it was pointed out that my actual goal here is ambiguous, so let me clarify:

A more verbose example:

I would like to buy GOOG calls, because I believe they're going to go up up up up up. I think, in fact, that GOOG is likely to be trading at at least 1500 on 3/13. What option to I buy to maximize proceeds?

\- I can buy a 1500 strike for 3/20. That'll cost me $145 and be worth $3146 on 3/13. ROI = 2169%

\- I can buy a 1450 strike for 3/20. That'll cost me $295 and be worth $6086 on 3/13. ROI = 2063%

\- I can buy a 1525 strike for 3/20. That's out of the money, but I've got 7 days left. It cost me $120 and would be worth $2446 on 3/13. ROI = 2038%

\- I can buy a 1500 strike for 4/17. That'll cost me $710 and be worth $5897 on 3/13. ROI = 830%

\- I can buy a 1500 strike for 5/15. That'll cost me $1850 and be worth $7141 on 3/13. ROI = 386%

Obviously, options that are closer to expiration have higher ROIs, but which one is actually best depends a lot on the current ask/bid as well as the modeled time value. I did the above by hand and it took a while and I didn't consider the other 200 options chains I could have looked at. I'm looking for a way to automatically do that.",2,0.63

2020-05-30 20:46:54,Real Estate ETFs that focus on suburb housing?,"I'm believing in the following, long-term trend.

Before COVID, the housing price in metro area was skyrocketing because highly-paid people wanted to live near by workplace. Remote work is an undeniable trend that will stick with many, though not all, tech companies/people, which are highly paid and the driving force for housing price. Look at TWTR, FB, GOOG, they all announced their long-term shift to remote work.

Still those people will stay *around* metro area because they will occasionally need to come to office, or they will at least think about the case when they buy a home. Most Google engineers won't buy a home in Nevada. Nevertheless, as far as commute is occasional, they will consider suburban areas they didn't before, e.g., 2-hours drive from city centers.

This will drive up the housing price in suburban areas that have nice properties (safety, school district, infrastructure) and 2-3 hour commute time to bay area, NY, etc.

Although I believe in this instinct, I don't find a good way to invest in it. Buying a home myself in those areas is too risky as I can't buy 100 homes in 100 areas for risk hedge.

Hence the question: is there any ETF that specifically invests in real estates in suburb areas (but not too rural like Alaska)?",9,0.74

My 401k is through Fidelity and I'm currently about half allocated to US large cap (will give that breakdown below), then smaller amounts to US mid cap (15%), US small cap (15%), international (10%), bonds (7%), and real estate (3%)

That big half of the portfolio to US large cap is itself split between a ""blue chip growth fund"" (20%) which top holdings include AMZN, APPL, GOOG, MSFT, FB, V, even TSLA... then 20% to S&P 500, and 10% to a large cap dividend fund.

The blue chip growth fund has been on a tear lately with those top names, for years I had been strongly just in the S&P500 fund but believed that ""blue chips"" were likely to better weather covid issues than the broad index funds, so I changed that up. My dilemma at this point is whether to stay allocated like this or shift even more heavily into that growth fund (w/ AMZN, APPL, MSFT) OR take some profits *from that* and reallocate into the areas that haven't bounced back as well, to capture such a rebound. The S&P500 hasn't done as well as those big name growth stocks, and small caps lag way behind that.

I had also considered going to even less on international, real estate, and near zero on bonds (my horizon is another 20 years), and again a question of what to put that into: growth, S&P, mid, small...

I know I can stick to a typical rebalancing strategy, but I'm willing to risk a bit more on a good thesis, for example I'm leaning to going even heavier toward those growth names now and further away from S&P, but also interested putting more into the small caps should they bounce back.

·  **Fed Chair Powell was quoted at the start of the conference saying that the Fed is ""not even thinking about thinking about thinking about raising rates.""** (Yes, he said ""thinking"" three times). Perhaps he was tired from working the money printer for too long.

· All 11 S&P Sectors ended in positive territory. The largest gainer was Energy, with Consumer Staples being the worst performer.

· Apple (AAPL 380.16, +7.15, +1.9%), Amazon (AMZN 3033.53, +33.20, +1.1%), Alphabet (GOOG 1522.02, +21.68, +1.5%), and Facebook (FB 233.29, +3.17, +1.4%) were all still testifying to the House Judiciary committee at the time of market close.

· Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 76.09, +8.48, +12.5%), Shopify (SHOP 1053.59, +68.59, +7.0%), and Starbucks (SBUX 77.42, +2.78, +3.7%) all had stellar earnings reflected in their gains today.

· On the contrary, Boeing (BA 166.00, -4.84, -2.8%) and General Electric (GE 6.59, -0.30, -4.4%) all closed lower after reporting their earnings. Boeing expects to cut 19,000 jobs and will not see 2019 levels for three years.

It is easy to calculate the RoI of each stock, no problem on that front. My challenges are the following:

1- How do I account for sold stocks (i.e. I bought GOOG three times (10 shares each time) with different prices, sold 10 shares. Which price should I use for the capital gains?

2- How do I account for sold shares in my RoI

2020-03-26 21:51:25,"Investing in Online ""Businesses""","Does anyone have experience with this?  

Lmk if this is not the type of investing we talk about in this sub; I invest in equities and real estate like everyone here, but in recent years I've been looking at buying businesses - specifically, online ones.  

Here's a good aggregator of these types of businesses: [https://app.centurica.com/marketwatch](https://app.centurica.com/marketwatch)

* These typically trade at 2.5-3x multiples of annual profits - which are basically the same as offline, brick & mortar businesses if I'm judging by local comps (I'm in Southern California).  
* The monetization models are basically ad-driven, ecommerce, SAAS, affiliate, KDP (books), dropship, etc., but the whole pitch is that these are largely passive.  According to all the brokers out there (I won't name them for reasons you'll see below), these are enterprises where you only need to work 2-3 hours a week.  You hire a VA, you outsource, you manage, and live a sub-4 hr workweek.  
* Purchase prices are anywhere between $15k-$1m+.

So theoretically you get a 25-30% mostly passive return (inverse of above multiple).  Going into it, my whole thesis has been, why don't I assemble a portfolio of about $200k-300k in these, work 10 hours a week, and earn six figures on a passive basis.  If you go out there, you'll see all sorts of blog content & podcasts touting this lifestyle.  

So after doing a lot of due diligence, I invested in one and have since evaluated about 15-20 others - signing NDAs, putting down deposits, all to look through their financials.  

And with the experience of the business I bought (it's an ad-driven one), and looking through the financials of what seems like countless others, I'm leaning toward the idea now that these brokers are sca-, I mean, misleading.  

**I'm writing because I want some opposing opinions; I** ***want*** **to be wrong here.  But these are my big red flags I can't get answered by any broker or seller to the extent that I would commit another $100-200k to this strategy:** 

* First, I mean, if you're really earning 25-30% passively at 2-3 hours a week, why would you sell the business?  Especially in the $100k+ price range, where it means you're 'passively' earning at least $30-35k a year?  Where are you going to get that return otherwise?  All the sellers I've spoken to have the exact same answer: they have ""another project"" they want to get into.  But unless they're multimillion dollar projects, why don't you just 'passively' operate the businesses for a year or two and build up the cash to do it?
* Next, all the brokers, unless it's usually a $400k+ business and thus will have to qualify for an SBA loan in order to attract a wide buyer pool, will tell you they ""do not have"" access to real financials (expenses).  So you need to buy based on pro forma expenses.  Every business I've looked at will send you a simple sheet of absurdly low expenses - one $4/hr VA from the Philippines, $100/year hosting costs or whatever, but here's the thing about online businesses: *every single* consumer tech company we all know needs to spend a ton on marketing and awareness.  Every consumer 'internet' company is not profitable precisely b/c of marketing & consumer acquisition.    
But, when you look at the financials of most of these online 'businesses', expenses are like 10-20% of revenues, max.  Unless it's ecommerce, in which case there's COGS and almost nothing else.  How is it the case that these companies can get and hold on to their customers without spending ANY money on marketing and advertising?  The brokers and sellers will tell you: oh, we have great SEO, we're targeting an ultra niche long-tail keyword that no one else is targeting,...a laundry list.  This point is the one I can't get my head around the most.  If you check out their listings, you will see a ton of businesses launched in the 2017-2018 vintage and being sold (dumped?) now.  They will show a crazy exponential visitor growth curve.  And they will state that they spent nothing on marketing.  I mean, if you're really so good that you can drive millions of visitors to a run-of-the-mill baby clothes AMZN FBA business, or a romance novel KDP business, or scale an authority site on survival gear in a matter of 18 months by yourself with no paid marketing, shouldn't you go work at or build a real unicorn?  You'd get paid more instead of trying to cash out of a $200k website.  
* Which gets to my last point, which is that for a lot of these sites I'm quite skeptical that the number of hours you need to work, even after 'training', is anywhere less than 20 hours.  There is simply no moat on these businesses.  GOOG & YT algorithms are getting changed all the time, and AMZN competes with its own sellers.  The point is that to stay ahead of the constantly changing situations, and the fact that a kid in his underwear from Saigon or Chiang Mai can instantly start a website that does the exact same thing as you, using all the exact same tools, means that...how can you be 'passive'?  

By no means am I saying that you're not actually buying a real business.  But that's the point.  I think these 'business' sales are really all 'asset' sales.  You're buying a website.  You're not buying a 25-30% return b/c you don't even know what the expenses truly are.  You're buying yourself a job, just as you would with an offline business which trade at similar multiples to these 'online businesses'.  You get location independence, yes, i.e. you can run it from Koh Samui at any hour of the day, but you also don't really get any sort of advantage over an offline business in your town, which is more subject to space constraints & regulations & a *moat* than online stuff, because the platforms you built the businesses on are constantly changing, 0 barrier to entry, and low-cost competition is rampant.  The advantage of online seems negated.  

So my question is: if you're trying to be a micro-PE fund and 'invest' in these, how can you tell the real businesses from the fake ones?  Because the brokers are not incentivized to tell you and won't.  Should I just concentrate on businesses that will provide audited financials?  

And please tell me how I'm wrong and why..

Sorry it's so long.  

**TL;DR is:** 'online business' investing is a trend promising 25-30% largely passive returns.  I have strong reasons to believe these are nowhere near that level of return, nor passive, and not that enticing.  But tell me why I'm wrong because I want to retire.",9,0.77

High Beta is the biggest winner, 34.4% vs. 31.5% for the S&P 500 as a whole. Quality took second place at 33.9%. Buybacks and Minimum Volatility tied for third place with 32.4%.

Interestingly, they think **Value beat Growth** in 2019. Kind of hard to believe given how well the BIG FIVE growth stocks did (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, FB, GOOG). I guess it's all in how they define the factors, which are summarized in the bottom half of the PDF.

2019-10-03 08:40:52,Creating your own index fund,"With many online brokerages moving towards commission free trading, I thought it would be fun to calculate how much capital would be required to create your own S&P 500 Index portfolio. This is assuming you have to buy at least 1 whole share of the lowest weighted, highest cost component, which ended up being $NVR at $$3,598.71 a share. The total capital required ended up being $7,009,342.13 based on share prices at the time of calculation.

&nbsp;

This exercise gave me a new appreciation for the Vanguards and BlackRocks of the world. Even if you don't have any transaction cost, managing and re-balancing something as simple as an S&P 500 index fund can be complicated. What do you all think? Would anyone attempt to do this if they had the capital? It's amazing index funds do all of this for fractions of a percent.

2020-03-08 23:58:07,First time investing tomorrow!,"I've got 20k USD to invest starting Monday. It'll be my first time buying individual stocks/ETFs. 

I'm 22, got a tech job (therefore primarily looking for tech stocks to invest in), and current put about 400$ into a 401k every month.

I've been considering dropping money into MSFT, GOOG, FB, VOO and SWPPX.

What is your advice for how to get started, which stocks/funds to buy!! Thanks!

Also how long should I wait, since it's one crazy market rn! I worry that if I wait too long, stocks will start recovering and I'll lose out on potential profits. I know this way of thinking isn't correct from what I've heard, but can someone tell me why!!

I have a fair amount of experience with shorter term swing trading in the past few years, but want to take advantage of the drop and hold for however long it takes to get back to/above ATHs. Most of these companies I chose because of their strength in the past and leading up to the crash. I don't see any of them going under from this, even if it takes awhile to recover. Please feel free to share your thoughts and any info about the stocks that I may have overlooked. I plan to buy small amounts of maybe 7-10 of them depending how things go. Also feel free to share your own lists and ideas for when this all levels out.

2020-05-29 01:44:31,Stock Price Drawdown Analysis,"Does anyone here use drawdown analysis in your investment strategy? 

I'm trying to come up with an averaging up (adding to your winners) investment strategy and one way for me to determine exits and cutting of losses is to see if a stock has draw down X% from the peak, taking the benchmark into consideration. 

So for example, I have found out, if you held GOOG since IPO, you would never have incurred a 25% loss from peak unrealized gain if you had an equal short SPY hedge. 

Now I am curious, is this a typical characteristic of a small company that's going to be big? What is the optimal % loss from peak threshold so you get to catch the FANG super performers from the beginning and ditch the losers? 

Perhaps somebody with programming skills can automate this % drawdown analysis for all stocks and come up with a conclusion.

2020-02-05 07:24:30,Anyone trading FitBit at today's share price?,"Google has announced an intent to purchase FitBit for $7.35/share, and it's intended for the deal to close in 2020.  This is pending regulatory/anti-trust approval, but no other tangible uncertainties to my awareness.  I don't really see how there can be an anti-trust problem for Google to further enter competition with Apple.  FIT is trading at $6.52, so that means that anyone who buys today stands to profit 12.7% in less than a year.  Sure there's risk, and perhaps opportunity cost in that last year the S&P500 outperformed a 12.7% return.

Still, it seems like a good risk/reward investment to me, and if that's not already good enough, January 2022 calls on FIT for a strike price of $10 currently have trading volume and a bid price of 7 cents.

So you can buy 100 shares of FIT for $652, get paid an immediate $7 back for writing the covered call, and get paid $735 later this year (likely) when GOOG completes the purchase.  How is this not a compelling trade right now?",1,0.67
2020-01-08 19:09:32,Why do you think your largest individual holdings will beat the market this year?,"Just an exercise I've been engaging in that I thought others might enjoy. Most of us invest in companies for the long-run but a full year is a significant holding period.

AMT - Hard to find this combination of a stable, well-run, largely recession-proof business that still has solid top-line growth. Highly valued company but I think they stack up quite well compared to current market valuations. Smart money will continue to buy/accumulate on any dips.

BDX - I can't confidently say this will beat the market in an election year just because it's healthcare. But another largely recession-proof business with top line growth. Also a Dividend Aristocrat. Any political impact would just be noise and a possible buying opportunity.

GOOG - My thought is that whatever tech innovation happens, they will find a way to capitalize. Either through acquisition, partnership, or a competing offering. I bought them in 2015 so at this point I'm also not selling to avoid a tax hit. Admittedly a Tech Index would probably accomplish my goal with less company-specific risk.

So I learned BDX is a rocky pick for this year but may have opportunities to add to my position, and GOOG could probably be replaced by a market-weighted tech index for my investment goals. And that I feel quite confident about AMT being my largest holding.",4,0.61

2020-02-06 08:37:24,Growth versus fundamentals,"Recently and most knowingly for the past year with low interest rates and REPO funding by the FED were seeing incredible appreciation of equity pricing in US markets. However this move is most noticeably seen for the TECH sector with Nasdaq beating other index’s in terms of growth in the past year or so. I was wondering however the true nature of Tech stocks ( high growth) and what investors are truly investing for. Most tech stocks, AMZN for one, are generating great revenue and have strong cash flow. They mainly stress the idea of reinventing profits into the companies future instead of paying a dividend,etc - leading one to call the stocks, “growth stocks”. However when catalyst for consumer spending decays what are investors truly getting from stocks such as AMZN, GOOG, etc. Its no longer about purchasing value but purchasing future value imo, hence why most analyst use forward earnings forecast ( a number which I think is frankly overrated, since it always assumes performance under a stagnant macro environment which is truly unpredictable imo). My prime question is are investors in growth stocks investing for strong cash flow or true value ( book value)? What happens during an economic downturn/black swan event to growth stocks? Should investors and portfolio managers be only shifting a small % of capital as the beta on them outweigh the possible gains they have in the short term ( 1 year or so)? 

For my personal portfolio would this be inefficient as the risk reward may be lower: 40% - value stocks with good divended payment, 20% growth stocks that have consistent cash flow/better tangible value, 35% treasuries, 5% gold and commodities",0,0.33

Will we crater back to reality on our stocks and have a slow recovery?

Somewhat interesting read - also talks about how Europe etc hasn't even recovered from 2008 meanwhile US has had extreme growth. Seems to me we've just pushed forward slow future earnings to this decade by providing so much cash for m&a, rollups and also development etc.

21% = broad etf / us growth

7%  = VGT (tech)
3% = MGK (mostly tech)

IHI 5% (med devices)
VBK 2% (small cap growth)

49% is a mix of stocks which are mostly tech: adbe, msft, dis, payc, brkb, v/mastercard, Bx, Goog, CRM


I want to reduce my tech exposure because I feel like the between SPY/VFIAX already have a tech heavy weight with some diversification (MGK less diverse), VGT is total tech

then man of my individual names are also tech: adbe, msft, payc, amzn, crm

I don't know where you classify v/ma exactly

some random small positions like T/bx/cvs/reits/ and a medium position in IHI

2018-02-17 12:18:30,I have 100k all in one US stock. How should I diversify this to ensure a financially stable future?,"Hello everybody! Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'll start with some background information:

I am 21 years old and in my fourth year of university. I study international business. When I was born, my grandfather invested in a US stock (biopharma) for me that split many times and ended up as a large sum of cash. It has paid for my college thus far and will leave me in the green after graduation. I have no debt. With only one semester left, I'll probably have somewhere near $90k when I graduate. I also have about $10k in cryptocurrency. My stock pays about a 3% dividend. I have no credit. I am also a dual citizen of USA and Switzerland with the opportunity to invest easily in international markets.

However, as I am currently an unemployed student, I depend on these funds for my daily living expenses such as rent, insurance, and food. At this rate, without any income, these funds will all be gone within a few more years of living off of them. Considering how high the market is, I'm a bit worried about a market crash/correction, especially because all of my eggs are in one basket. This leads to my questions for y'all.

How should I diversify these funds so that they continue to grow and prosper throughout my life? What actions should I take to set up a successful financial future with my current financial position? What would be the best way to utilize these funds in creating passive income streams?

I've been researching other stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds, but have been unable to come to a consensus on my own. Some specific options I've looked into are ARKW, AMZN, GOOG, TSLA, FB, QQQ, and NVDA, as well as other forms of investment such as real estate and gold. I'm very interested in industries such as tech, renewable energy, marijuana, blockchain, and finance.

I know you all are finance gurus, and I could really use your help in planning for a secure, successful financial future. Any guidance and advice is much appreciated. Thank you so much in advance!",67,0.8
2019-09-08 11:16:33,Question About Google Stock,"I was looking at Google's SEC filings. According to a 2004 filing, ([http://quote.morningstar.com/stock-filing/Quarterly-Report/2004/9/30/t.aspx?t=:GOOG&ft=10-Q&d=10b5f56a6d729e50](http://quote.morningstar.com/stock-filing/Quarterly-Report/2004/9/30/t.aspx?t=:GOOG&ft=10-Q&d=10b5f56a6d729e50)) there were about 58 million Class A shares outstanding (and about 215 million Class B but that's not relevant to my question).

Today, ([https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204419000015/goog10-qq12019.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204419000015/goog10-qq12019.htm)) there seem to be just under 300 million Class A shares outstanding and 348 million Class C. I know there was a 2 for 1 split from Class A to C, but doesn't that mean there should be 58 million A and an equal number of C?

I wasn't aware of Google doing any secondary offerings (and didn't find any on a quick search), so where did the other 240 million Class A shares (and 290 million Class C) come from?

2019-06-02 09:12:55,"GURU vs Titan, 12 month review","GURU and Titan both pick stocks based on top performing hedge funds. Which one is better? There’s only one way to find out. Last year I put $1000 into both GURU and Titan.

&#x200B;

Titan is a roboadvisor app that will allocate your contributions amongst 20 stocks for you weighted equally. The 20 stocks are picked based on analysis of holdings from actual hedge funds. Analyzing public filings including 13F’s play a major role in determining what stocks are held.  They will apply a “short” position to the market depending on the results of your risk tolerance quiz. Seems like they are using Proshares Short S&P500 (SH) for this.

&#x200B;

All their marketing compares their services to the real hedge funds. You get the top picks, regular research digests, and inverse positions during downturns. All this makes Titan’s 1% advisory fee look like a bargain compared to the 2% fee plus 20% earnings fee that a real hedge fund would charge. Charging 1% is a lot, but it could be worth it if they can match their hypothetical 10 year returns of 12-14% annualized. If you like frequent communication on how each of the 20 corporations are performing, what moves they are making, and how the trade war is impacting business, then Titan is perfect for you.

&#x200B;

Titan periodically swaps one stock for another, but keeps a cap on 20 stocks total. Here’s what my portfolio holds:

Disney (DIS), InterActive (IAC), Charter Communications (CHTR), Visa (V), Autodesk (ADSK), Mastercard (MA), Alphabet (GOOG), Credit Acceptance (CACC), PayPal (PYPL), PTC (PTC), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Transdigm (TDG), Charles Schwab (SCHW), Amazon (AMZN), Boeing (BA), Netflix (NFLX), Salesforce (CRM), Facebook (FB), Constellation (STZ).

&#x200B;

GLB X FUNDS/GURU IX (GURU) is an ETF that runs a similar style of algorithm, analyzing the public hedge fund filings. The fee is 0.75%. It holds 60 stocks weighted equally.  The fee is less compared to Titan for a similar investment approach, but you don’t get the earnings call summaries, videos from the founder, ect. You can find what stocks are in the fund here: [https://www.globalxfunds.com/funds/guru/](https://www.globalxfunds.com/funds/guru/)

&#x200B;

Here are the values for the purchase date 5-22-18, the same day one year later 5-22-19, and a half way point 11-23-18. The chart compares the value of my Titan account, GURU value, GURU share price, and share price of SPY ETF.

&#x200B;

|||\-5.30%|2.50%|
|SPY|$270.94|$263.25|$285.63|
|||\-2.80%|5.40%|

&#x200B;

Titan earned 11% in value, GURU only gained 2.5%, while SPY gained 5.3%. 

&#x200B;

All of those gains have evaporated as the market takes a giant deuce. Here are the values from the 5-22-18 to last Friday.  I’m at a rough break even with Titan, and GURU is down 1.7%. I expect the retraction to be temporary. BTFD

|||\-1.70%|
|SPY|$270.94|$275.27|
|||1.60%|

&#x200B;

With the dip in the market, I’ve decided to add an additional $4k to Titan. I’m happy with the performance so far, and the interface is pretty slick. The regular digests make for good talking points that help me look like I’m on top of current events. When I first opened an account with Titan there was a promotion for zero fee on balances up to $1k, so no fee was deducted during the past year. My fee waiver is now expired, but a 1% fee will only cost me about $50 for the year. Not the end of the world. If I convince a friend to open an account, we both get our fees discounted by 0.25%. Four referrals earn me zero fee forever. I’m not going to publicly post my code here per the rules. If you have questions keep it out of the comments and DM me.

&#x200B;

I wish Titan offered Turbotax integration. I almost threw my computer out the window adding the 1099 information manually. The forms were easy to download from Titan, but the interface in Turbotax to enter the numbers was utter garbage. I understand minimum viable product and everything, but I’m dumbfounded that a cutting edge fintech software company doesn’t have this. Apparently there was a way to do this with an Apex account that I didn’t learn about until after I filed.

&#x200B;

As far as GURU is concerned, I’m not sold. It couldn’t keep up with SPY during the past year.  I know one year isn’t really long enough for a fair comparison. Comparing SPY to GURU since it launched June 2012, GURU gained 95% and SPY gained 99.9%. I can’t find a reason to justify owning GURU over SPY. There doesn’t seem to be a major advantage to how GURU picks its portfolio of 60 stocks. If you’re looking for something you can set and forget, there’s plenty of money to be made on index funds.

2019-04-27 20:53:29,"How to negate a company/sector when buying an ETF, due to working in said sector?","I am someone who invests using ETF's, specifically just using S&P500 ETFs. Lets say I want more exposure to the EU markets, so I just buy some shares of an EU based ETF like SX5E.

But let' say I want the opposite, and decrease my exposure to something an S&P500 ETF has? For example, someone who works in the tech sector (like at a tech startup) is very exposed to tech via, well, their job. If the tech sector has problems then they might also loose their job, hence being arguablly over exposed.

In a perfect world you could just go ""I want the S&P500 ETF but without FB, GOOG, AMZN, etc"", but that's not really possible for various reasons. So is there any other instrument one can use to ""inverse"" holding those companies? I hear Options or Puts can be used, in which case I can buy them on a monthly basis, but I know basically nothing about them, so I figured I would ask here first before going down that rabbit hole.",3,0.67

I can get a fixed loan of $20k for 5.45%. Meanwhile, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG and many other secure companies are growing at much greater than a conservative 10%. 

Would it be more sensible to invest the car principle in these stocks and pay for the car with a loan since their growth is greater than the loan interest rate?

2019-01-04 00:15:49,Why are stock prices tied to company performance?,"So I get that when you're buying a stock, you're buying a share of ownership in a company, so in some simplistic way it makes sense that your share should be ""more valuable"" when the company is more successful.  But in practice I'm having trouble understanding why that should be the case.

What I mean is, after the IPO, it seems like there is very little which relates the share price to the company at all.  If I buy a common stock from another investor, I'm not giving the company more capital to grow it's business with.  And if the company gets more successful it seems like the only thing that changes is that my share becomes more attractive to other investors.  But that's kind of circular, because the share is only more attractive to other investors because they think it will increase in value to *other investors*.

I know there are things like dividends, and voting rights, but for the average retail investor that vote will mean a minuscule impact as far as the direction of the company, and the income generated from the dividend will be relatively small compared with what they hope to gain from the value of the stock.  And there are such things as non-voting, no-dividend stocks like GOOG (alphabet class C).

2018-05-29 08:52:11,"Why can no one else use Amazons ""no profit"" strategy","OK, so obviously Amazon shareholders are happy with Amazon basically not declaring profits because they trust Bezos to basically lead Amazon to monopolistic dominance in x years. How did this work in the beginning, when it wasn't immediately clear that Amazon would be as dominating as it is now. I understand that retail/e\-commerce is a low margin industry.

Let's take a competitor for example. Alphabet has the most ridiculous profit margins. It's just the nature of the online ad business and Google's dominance of it. Google is getting into e\-commerce more and more \(Express and Shopping\) but as said, this is a low margin industry. So Google has less to gain in terms of profit than Amazon has to gain from getting into the ad business in turn.

But why are shareholders making such a fuss when Alphabet sees rising costs? Obviously they're gonna invest tens of billions into Cloud Platform and especially AI \(differentiating factor\), because they have to. They can't let Amazon continue to dominate with AWS. Is this just good old short term thinking on the investors part. Because it seems to me that in tech, and especially and the level of AMZN, MSFT, GOOG it's all about capturing the market and having the dominant \(or at least competitive\) platform with the most engagement and developer activity.

2018-08-13 16:51:54,Getting solidly beat by S&P500 this year - lessons learned?,"Most people crow about  gainz, but I'm getting beat pretty solidly by the S&P500 so far this year, despite a pretty straightforward portfolio, so I thought I'd share a few thoughts on why I'm +1.5% vs. SPY +6.6%.... 5% off pace.

* My top holding (15% of portfolio), CAPE (uses CAPE ratio for focus on sectors) is actually outperforming (+8.9%) as it often does
* Next, VTI (10%) is on par, as expected, and even a little ahead (+8.2%)
* Other beta=1 holdings are SPY (6%), SUSA (environmentally friendly SPY, 5% of portfolio) is +5.4%

I also have a few variants to tweak my weightings away from tech mega cap, but typically return the same:

* SCHA is +8.6%, EQL is even sector weighting, +4.5% combined for \~10% of portfolio.
* IUSV is value small cap, which has been weak, (+1%) but is only 2% of my portfolio.

So far so good!

Then, I get nailed with my ex-US ETFs:

* Europe/Developed: VEA (7% of portfolio) down (-4%), SCZ & EFV (small cap/value developed ETFs @ 3% of portfolio) down  4%
* Emerging: VWO (2%) is down almost 9% and EEM (same weighting) is down about the same.

Then there's a few bond funds:

* IBDQ, IBMG and HYG, combined at about 10% of portfolio, are flat

And REIT ETFs:

* VNQ is flat, VNQI down 5% for about 10% of my portfolio.

With individual stocks, I'm mostly doing great, but it's <10% of my portfolio:

* AAPL, BRK.B, ADBE, GOOG, LLY

(And then I'm down a bunch from GBTC giving back gains from the past couple of years, but still far in the black after selling in increments over the years.)

Overall? I'm mainly weak because of ex-US and the other parts of my portfolio used for diversification. Indeed, my performance is pretty darn close to VT over this year. So, I'm following a lot of the received wisdom on diversification of all sorts, and performing as expected. However,  I can't help but wonder if I should have been focused more on US, especially when I look at the [chart for developed markets the past 15 years.](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/EEM#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%3D%3D) Emerging markets can be good, but ex-US developed markets have been off for a while now...

2016-01-15 04:59:23,White House proposes committing $4B to self-driving cars,"Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx says Pres. Obama's 2017 budget proposal will include $4B for self-driving car pilot projects over a 10-year span. Among other things, the funds would cover a program to test self-driving cars on technologically advanced roads.

To encourage tests, the DOT also plans to make up to 2,500 self-driving cars exempt from some proposed safety rules for up to two years, and to work with state governments to create state regulations for autonomous vehicles. It suggests an interest in lowering auto fatalities is behind the effort. Foxx: ""We ask ourselves, 'What if human error could be eliminated? That is a possibility worth pursuing.

""Mobileye which is going after the autonomous driving market via its driver-assistance systems, is a potential beneficiary. As is Google/Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), which has amassed a major lead in real-world driving data for self-driving prototypes, and is looking to bring a self-driving car to market by 2020. A JV with Ford is rumored to be on the way.",204,0.9
2018-10-12 05:49:34,Buy the dip? Rotate positions? what do I do,"Got pretty hammered on a few positions - looking at you Square. I've got about 20% sitting in cash on the sidelines.

This fall has also pushed a number of my positions that were up a lot into flat or even net losses, and I've been wanting to rotate some out of tech as I'm way over weight there.

Do I sell some of those tech positions now that they are at a loss and move them to some of the more stable positions I was hoping to get into?

Do I keep the cash sitting - obviously no one can predict the bottom etc etc etc, so do I just bite and enter on this dip with half of the cash on the sidelines?

-DIS

-TRBCX

-JNJ

-V

-MSFT (yeah tech but, solid co)



- DO i add more to the tech stocks I had, I mean a lot fo the gains were wiped out: ADBE, ROKU,  AMZN, GOOG, FB (FANG looking attractive), and what do i do with SQuare [ave in 76 - buy more?]?

-suggestions? Also what do you guys think about Macy's? I dind't realize they are giving a 4.7% dividend [It wasn't even on my radar until I saw some lengthy discussion about it last night. They do have great RE holdings but arent monetizing it very well, still not really truely looking to add just thought I'd ask]


edit: My goal is to rotate into some value stocks b/c I'm too heavy tech and growth

edit2: I freed up some cash selling my small holdings in QQQ, Russel 2000 etf, and CIBR.. with that cash I bought a little more IHI(med devices etf), ROKU, VISA, ADBE, BRK.B and few shares of Alphabet even though I kind of missed the dip

2019-07-28 10:46:26,"WSJ: With Stocks at Fresh Highs, Investors’ Portfolios Look Alike. Mastercard, Microsoft, Amazon and PayPal are among market’s most crowded trades","A rally in stocks has triggered unusual circumstances for some of Wall Street’s biggest investors—they are holding many of the same companies.

A list of the market’s most crowded trades includes Mastercard Inc., MA 0.97% Microsoft Corp. MSFT 0.82% , Amazon.com Inc., AMZN -1.56% Abbott Laboratories ABT -0.28% and PayPal Holdings Inc., PYPL 0.32% according to analysts at Bernstein, who tracked institutional ownership, price momentum, earnings forecasts and valuations.

The overlap in the top 50 stocks holdings between mutual funds and hedge funds—two types of investors whose styles typically differ—now stands at near-record levels, a study by Bank of America Merrill Lynch found.

Investors are drawn to stocks that have performed well and risen fast. Shares that notched the fastest gains last year are valued nearly 25% higher than normally relative to their next 12 months of earnings, Bank of America’s study showed. Big movers include Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., CMG 0.30% Starbucks Corp. and VeriSign Inc. VRSN 0.34%

Some consequences of the trend were on display last week, after earnings surprises from Amazon, Ford Motor Co. F 0.10% , Tesla Inc. and Google’s parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG 10.45% sparked outsize moves in their share prices. Tesla and Ford, two stocks that have trended higher in recent months, declined sharply when those companies reported disappointing results. Meanwhile, Google’s stock soared after the company reported that revenues rose 19% over the same period last year.

Big surges, like Google’s 9.6% gain on Friday, can make those companies even more appealing to trend-following investors, further concentrating them in a relatively small group of stocks, analysts said.

At the same time, few are willing to risk going against the crowd. Stocks that are comparatively cheap have attracted little interest, according to BofAML’s research. Short interest on what is known as FAANG stocks— Facebook Inc., Apple Inc., AAPL 0.35% Amazon, Netflix Inc. and Alphabet—is at historic lows, the bank said.

“This huge world of investible assets has shrunk down to a small cohort,” said Savita Subramanian, equity and quantitative strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “We’re all in this echo chamber where everyone goes to the same dinners and drinks the same Kool-Aid.”

This week investors are awaiting a spate of key economic reports, including data on consumer spending, manufacturing and Friday’s nonfarm-payroll report, which investors will be gleaning for information on how the U.S. economy fared in July.

While most believe the Federal Reserve will deliver a 25 basis-point rate cut at its meeting on Wednesday, strong economic data could challenge projections for how much the central bank will ease monetary policy during the rest of the year, a potential obstacle for the market’s rally.

As earnings season rolls on, investors will also get a look at results from a range of companies, including Apple and Mastercard. These two companies are among those that have provided money managers safety in numbers.

Years of tepid expansion have also made investors hesitant to broaden their holdings outside of the companies delivering eye-catching results. That caution has been exacerbated in recent months, as slowing growth around the world sparked fears of a looming recession, widening the valuation gap between growth and value stocks to record levels, data from DWS Group showed.

Yet some investors worry that the concentration of money in a short list of stocks could exacerbate market declines if bad news sparks a rush to the exits. Some of the same large tech stocks led a May selloff that pulled the Nasdaq Composite into correction territory with a more than 10% decline from its highs, a steeper drop than the ones that hit the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500.

Contrarian and value-oriented strategies have waned in popularity in recent years as investors struggle to outperform market-tracking funds. Disagreement among analysts about a company’s earning prospects can also make shares comparatively unpopular.

Kent Engelke, managing director at Capitol Securities Management, has avoided those big tech stocks over the last three years, concentrating instead on finding stocks that are undervalued relative to the rest of the market. Lately, that has led him to invest in unglamorous areas like consumer nondurables and the oil sector.

“I’m miserable,” he said. “The last three years have been among the most difficult ever out of 33 in the industry because we haven’t owned FAANG.”

He plans on sticking to his guns, however, convinced that the rally can fall apart if the Fed eases monetary policy less than expected or if companies’ balance sheets worsen.

That could result in “a really big, ugly selloff,” he said.

So far, few investors seem inclined to change their approach, although many are now increasing their positions in assets that would take the edge off a potential hit to their portfolios. Prices for gold, a popular destination for nervous investors, are near their highest level in six years, while the Swiss franc stands at a two-year high against the euro.

Analysts at UBS Global Wealth Management said that markets may be overestimating how far the Fed will cut rates and that trade tensions between the U.S. and China could weigh on growth. They have balanced their position in U.S. stocks, which is overweight relative to their benchmark, with positions in havens like long-maturity Treasurys and the Japanese yen.

“We don’t think the alarms should be ignored,” Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note to clients. “But we also think the long-term opportunity cost of aborting is likely to be too high.”

2017-05-23 08:33:37,Comparing the P/E of Alphabet(google) and every other company that's not Alphabet,"I am stunned when I see Alphabets P/E; with the endless moon shots and infinite bank account, stellar growth, and growth potential I would have thought Alphabet would be priced for its potential growth like so many companies that aren't even close to Alphabet, or as likely to hit big on their moonshots. 

But I see companies with astronomically higher P/E ratios compared to Alphabet. Amazon's roughly 180 and I think it can be argued it is justified. But even other companies that have the same P/E as google don't even compare to google's potential, Red Robin Gourmet Burgers has a PE OF 110... Netflix 206... Scott's Miracle Grow company has a higher PE then Alphabet at 37... how is this possible? how can someone justify buying this burger restaurant, video streaming service, lawn care company and thousands of other companies with similar PE ratios and even greater PE ratios over a monopoly search engine that buys, invests in, or just creates a new division when it wants to try a new potential life changing technology?

I personally believe Alphabets self driving car division alone, Waymo, is justification enough to have the PE be at least double. Which is why I bought a sizable sum of Goog recently(sizable for me).

I appreciate any insight in to why anybody would buy anything but this monopoly. 

*First post on any Reddit sub, sorry if I'm doing it wrong. Thanks for any insights y'all.
