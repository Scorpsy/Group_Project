2021-01-02 06:44:51,Pricing everything as if they are the next AMZN (TSLA story),"One of the things that amazes me currently in this market is that, it feels like we are trying to justify every new coming hot tech/growth company as if they are the next AMZN in their field. I think one of the delusions people are having lately is that they look at what people projected for AMZN 5-10-15 years ago and compare that to what actually happened.

While it is true that AMZN exceeded any sort of expectation by a huge margin (and did this consistently, year over year) it feels to me that we are taking perhaps one of the most unique success stories ever and then extrapolate that to others, thinking that as if those sort of growth and expectations are in fact more common and easy to achieve than not, regardless of the industry the subject company is operating in.

I could discuss this for a number of stocks, I wanted to open discussion for TSLA. As we all know, TSLA stock went up almost 8 fold in the last year. Today, it is common occurrence in the market that analysts are justifying these price levels and state why TSLA is just more than a car company. This argument obviously has its own merits, but aren't we little ahead ourselves and already attribute *from today,* all those things that could potentially be achieved and bake it into the price?

If we went back in in time, we could probably say AMZN was more than just a book company, but could we really say that they would have almost monopolistic power in most of the areas they operated in? Could we really say back in 2008 that AMZN would emerge the market leader in something like for instance Cloud? Or, did these things happen and then we realized how great AMZN became, *after the fact.* It feels like this was much easier to do in hindsight. But what if AMZN is truly that one outlier, anomaly, in the history of stock markets in terms of sustained growth and market power?

Isn't this what we are trying to do with TSLA here? I do think Elon is one of the greatest minds of our time and can achieve far beyond any other has achieved so I am not comparing Bezos or any other with Elon here. But what I am trying to say is that, just thinking TSLA as a company, aren't we already saying today that they already have monopolistic power in EV cars, autonomous driving, solar-energy trade, underground tunnels, robotaxis, etc. - you name it, as if they are already there and waiting to be switched on? It's as if we have already attributed everything we could imagine could happen and already announced TSLA as the winner.

Now this is the theory side of things. **How about financial side of things?**

I don't want to approach this from a car sales point of view, but I will make certain comments.

But what if we applied AMZN's growth trajectory into TSLA, without focusing too much on car sales, and just see what growth and valuation that would lead us? If TSLA is just more than a car company, what other example could serve best in terms of growth, thinking from an array of products and technological advantage perspective?

So I did a quick and dirty DCF calculation. In there, my starting point is the first year when AMZN hit $24 billion in revenue, which is 2009. TSLA achieved it's $24 billion in 2019, so from there onwards I am applying AMZN's growth trajectory for the following 10-11 years. Then, growth is gradually reduced in going into the terminal year. What this means is TSLA will be roughly $900 billion revenue generating company by year 20 (2040). From a car sales perspective, I can't really project how many cars it could sell in 20 years, but lets say it is 10 million cars. (I think GS said 15 million). Toyota in 2019 sold around this number I believe so with all the competition that will happen in this space, I think this is by no means and under-estimation. In 2019, TSLA sold roughly 367,500 cars and for a total revenue of $19.2 billion (excluding regulatory credits). On average this equates to $52k per car. In 20 years, car prices will be higher than what they are today obviously, but there will be competition and economies of scale to bring the price down. This one is hard to assume but let's say it grows 1.0% - 1.5% per year with long term inflation, again not necessarily higher because of these offsetting factors. If they do indeed sell 10+ million cars, this is roughly $600-650 billion from cars.

This leaves you with another $200-250 billion or so for other things, whatever you want to attribute this for - AI, robotaxies, insurance, and so on. Now this figure is a future value, so from today's perspective (using a discount rate of 8% used in my DCF below) that's roughly $60 billion (revenue). This is again a huge number, as it is almost another Facebook, 2x Coca-Cola etc., or half of GM/Toyota type business from revenue generating capability, again, from *today's perspective - none of which has already happened.*

Once again I want to point out that my revenue projections are not driven by bottoms-up car sales, rather, I am using simply AMZN trajectory in terms of growth, then try to attribute the resulting final revenue figure into parts, obviously majority being from car sales, and the rest from whatever you can think of. (Simply because we don't know what AI/Robos/Insurance/Transportation businesses can generate from revenue/profitability/market share perspective and more importantly what the competition in those areas can be). If you think TSLA can grow even more than AMZN, then I just want to remind you that you won't easily justify 40-50% revenue growth rates once you're in the 50+ billion zone, which is the point of the argument. AMZN, still achieved those growth rates when it had 100+ or 200+ billion, which is what we are already assuming here.

So in the stock price we have baked in, from a revenue perspective, a car business that will sell at least 10+ million cars (this number can obviously be higher but even 10 million will be big market share),  and other businesses that are worth, today, more than most companies you can think of.

Now this is the growth side of things. How about margins?

We know TSLA generated a last twelve months EBITDA margin of 14% as of Q3 2020. While margins from car manufacturing is certainly improving, most of this margin is actually attributed to sales of regulatory credits, which are by definition almost 100% profit. And so in reality, the margins are much lower, maybe around low single digits between 1-5%. Now this is important because even with all this revenue growth (and if you disagree with me and think it will even be higher), you still need to achieve big margins on your business. I mean really really good margins, we are talking about 15-25% each year. Interestingly, AMZN, while growing its top line crazily over the years and becoming a behemoth as it is today, always lacked in terms of their margins. That goes without saying they are a tech company that typically exhibit great returns on capital. So the point is they had to sacrifice their margins to be able to achieve this growth and this is an important point.

In my DCF, I am extremely generous. I kept TSLA's EBITDA margins at 15% for the next 3 years, bumped to 17.5%, 20.0%, then to finally 25.0% every 3 years in going forward. Once again these regulatory credits will not be there forever so those margins are extremely optimistic at this point. They might indeed achieve 25% margins in 10 years or so but it won't be this smooth.

With these two major factors, other items in the DCF are not super important. The discount rate is 8.0%, which I believe is reasonable, NWC and Capex assumptions are in line with what they are today and I don't think they would necessarily go down (if not go up). I just want to mention that you may completely disagree with some of the assumptions I outlined above. The point however is no matter what sort of DCF you come up with, you will end up either with lower or slight higher value for TSLA, using very, very aggressive assumptions for 10+ years. So the point and question is around the **margin of safety** here.

It seems I can't directly post pictures so here is the link for the DCF:

[https://ibb.co/mSHDcBh](https://ibb.co/mSHDcBh)

You might wonder, well your price is even higher than what it is today so why did you write this.

Once again my whole point in the argument was that the margin of error in TSLA's stock price right now is non-existent, because we've already treated it the next AMZN, gave the best margins possible, attributed big bucks on its other stuff. I think my DCF is still in the unreasonable side, but I wanted to point this out that even a s*light change in trajectory would mean a totally different path and stock price for TSLA.*

So the question is, are we ahead of ourselves with TSLA? This could also apply to others as well, this so called growth companies. It is as if we are pricing everything today and think that they have already achieved incredible market share in everything they touched and it's only a matter of time that these revenue/profits are realized. Are we taking one anomaly and applying this rationale for every other great company under the name of ""it's tech""? Elon is great and TSLA will be great. But the business model may not just allow them to be the next AMZN, regardless of technology or improvement.

One final comment I will make is related to autonomous driving and data TSLA is collecting. While it is for certain that this data gives TSLA an incredible power in developing this technology, I see couple of issues with this as it relates to future of this thing.

Companies such as Facebook are big not because of their software, but because of the network effects they exhibit. And because of those network effects they become larger and larger and are able to collect more data, which creates an incredibly profitable cycle for them as they can monetize that data right away. Data for TSLA here only matters in developing that technology. Monetization however, is another story.

What I am not entirely sure with all this AI story is that if it needs to continuously get updated for use, then how do regulators/companies determine the older version was safe to use to begin with. What I understand is that AI is something that needs to get constantly updated based on data, challenge here is that you are carrying people's lives here (as opposed to targeting ads) so there needs to be an infliction point where the full autonomous driving AI software should be at a point where it is certainly 100% safe to use. Because if it is not, then the technology fails until it reaches to that point. If it does reach out to that point, then how difficult is it going to be for others to get to that point or use similar technology if what you need is to get from point A to B safely.

Besides there is the price factor in as well. Let's say TSLA is the only one who can do this. If autonomous driving is too expensive, then how much will people pay for it? Say if the car is 50k and you have to pay extra 50k on top of that - would you do this? Would this have a cannibalization effect? Or if it is monthly subscription fees, would you go on to pay this forever? How significant will the cost be in 20 years from now when others presumably also start providing some sort of service.

On the other hand, if it is not expensive and only a fraction of the car price, then how are you going to achieve these growth levels with that data and technology to begin with. It is one thing to have a great technology, another to monetize it. They might license it for sure, but then you lose all that power right away. So the question then becomes, will it be a niche product or commodity at the end of the day - either of which will not allow you to have incredible returns.

I buy several times a week from them but I'm the biggest enemy of Amazon Choice and Best Seller .
I used to sort by reviews/stars but now sends you to unrelated items. Even though many fake reviews. 

LONDON (AP) — European Union regulators have filed antitrust charges against Amazon, accusing the e-commerce giant of using data to gain an unfair advantage over merchants using its platform.
The EU's executive commission, the bloc's top antitrust enforcer, said Tuesday that the charges have been sent to the company.
The commission said it takes issue with Amazon's systematic use of non-public business data to avoid “the normal risks of competition and to leverage its dominance"" for e-commerce services in France and Germany, the company's two biggest markets in the EU.
The EU started looking into Amazon in 2018 and has been focusing on its dual role as a marketplace and retailer.

In addition to selling its own products, the U.S. company allows third-party retailers to sell their own goods through its site. Last year, more than half of the items sold on Amazon worldwide were from these outside merchants.
Amazon faces a possible fine of up to 10% of its annual worldwide revenue, which could amount to billions of dollars. The company rejected the accusations.
“We disagree with the preliminary assertions of the European Commission and will continue to make every effort to ensure it has an accurate understanding of the facts,” the company said in a statement.
The company can, under EU rules, reply to the charges in writing and present its case in an oral hearing.
It’s the EU’s latest effort to curb the power of big technology companies, following a series of multibillion dollar antitrust fines against Google in previous years.",1132,0.96

> OP specifically said he/she wants to de-risk, aka diversify. It's not about not holding good companies, it's about hedging the risk if one has a bad series of news or events. It's inherently risky if your portfolio is heavily weighted in a handful of companies.

Another good summary of the ask for this discussion from /u/FerociousGiraffe :

>Trying to move your portfolio away from FAANG isn’t to say those are great, successful, hugely profitable companies. You’d keep a position in them. It’s about protecting against news that will only hurt FAANG while not hurting the broader market.

**EDIT3:**  Outside of suggestions like ""Why do you hate winning?"", some of the top solutions to dilute these stocks from your S&P 500 / U.S. equities part of a portfolio:

* Many suggest a variation of my original post of simply adding more sector funds outside of tech.  Though this strategy will unfortunately remove many non-giant tech companies in this sector.

* Many of you like /u/desquibnt suggests equal weighted ETFs like RSP.  However, RSP has a high net expense ratio of 0.20%.  

* /u/TriathlonNerd suggests a reverse cap weighted ETF like RVRS.  This too has a high net expense ratio of 0.29%.

* /u/BubbyginkESO and others suggests going broader than just 500 companies with low cost total market funds like Vanguard's VTI or Fidelity's FZROX.  While these 5 stocks still make up the top holdings, the effect of a larger basket of stocks also dilutes these companies.  So far, I like this simple and practical one the best.",1764,0.96

Well, it is difficult to explain why to every person individually and this new video from Ben Felix explains the reason why expertly.

The conclusion the video comes to is that you should just stick to low cost index funds (preferably globally diversified) rather than investing into large cap growth or trying to find the next Apple or Amazon.

**EDIT:** The definition of a ""growth"" company (as literally explained in the video) is a company that is ""expensive"" relative to the market. Expensive how? Well, relative to some fundamental ratio like P/B or P/E. Considering all the companies I have listed in my title have relatively high P/E and P/B ratios, you can say they are expensive. This makes them by definition a growth company. This isn't that hard to understand. If I said they are tech companies, no one would argue because they literally are tech companies. Well, just as much as they are tech companies, they are growth companies. They might not all be as expensive as each other, but relative to the market, they are expensive.

2020-09-25 07:31:28,$AMZN - media business now estimated to be worth nearly $600bn with launch of Luna,"Needham:

""Yesterday, at AMZN's devices and services event, AMZN announced Luna+, a $6/month (intro price) cloud gaming subscription competitor to Google's Stadia ($10/month), Microsoft xCloud($15/month), and EA's Origin Access ($15/month). **Although AMZN's content is inferior to competitors today, we expect its Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) to be below competitors, thanks to its Twitch and AWS integrations.**""

""We believe additional value from Luna+ comes from: a) building brand trust with the next generation (16-26 year olds); b) upside from sub revs, which are valued at 9x Rev vs AMZN's avg of 4x; and, c) a new rev stream using AWS & Twitch that raises AMZN’s barriers to entry.""

""**We calculate that AMZN's media revenue streams are worth nearly $600B, or about 40% of AMZN's total EV, suggesting these businesses are the most undervalued piece of AMZN.**""

""Advertising's Hidden Value. The ""hidden"" value of AMZN's advertising's expected 50% y/y growth in FY21E is important because many public companies with comparable ad rev growth rates trade above 7x and up to 22x revs. We use an average of 14.5x EV/Rev.""

""Subscription Revs Hidden Value. Similarly, subscription revenue streams typically trade at much higher EV/Rev multiples than AMZN's core business, so anything that adds revenue in subscription silos grows AMZN's value faster, we believe. Consumer-facing subscription revenue is generally predictable, sticky, has upside optionality to add more rev/month over time, and has high switching costs and barriers to entry. As a consequence, many subscription business models trade at 7x-12x EV/Rev, well above AMZN's avg.""

""Luna. By implication, successful growth of subscriber revenue streams suggests faster upside valuation revisions for AMZN. A gating factor to this potential upside value driver is introducing new subscription services, like Luna.""

""Twitch and AWS Integrations Lower AMZN's Risks. AMZN's economic risks of Luna failing is lower than its competitors because it already owns the cloud servers required through AWS, and it also owns the dominant video game viewing platform in Twitch, which it is integrating into Luna.

Therefore, even if Luna fails, it should cost far less than other companies that don't already own cloud servers and a huge number of video gamers already spending hours per day on a sister-platform.""",861,0.95

Is GOOG a good buy? Are these other companies just overvalued? Curious what you all think.  
Here's my thinking:

* GOOG has rock-solid fundamentals - excellent gross margins, has maintained \~15%+ YoY revenue growth even at their scale, and search is a steady business with many entrypoints across the Google ecosystem
* GOOG has bets across so many forward-looking industries that I think they will be able to diversify over time and don't have real risk of not continuing to innovate. There's of course the risk of anti-trust and privacy regulations, but that's been true for years now (although things do appear to be ratcheting up).
* It seems their stock hasn't mooned during covid because a meaningful share of search volume (and subsequently search revenue) comes from brick-and-mortar businesses (as opposed to someone like FB, whose ads biz is more of an ecommerce/direct-to-consumer play), which puts a drag on their revenue.

2020-11-15 08:24:45,Reassessing $amzn and if it's a buy/hold at over $3000,"I've been invested in $amzn since 2016 and have done round about a 5X on my investment. With Amazon running up to over $3k I've decided to reassess my investment once again, this time focusing on more than just the fundamentals because it's such a unique bunch of businesses under one umbrella.

I took this info and really analyzed it also making a detailed video, and I've personally come to the answer that $amzn is nowhere near done growing.

This is not an extensive list, but here are some of the top areas keeping me attracted to $amzn:

1. Interviewing philosophy. Especially how they have over 3400 ""Bar Raisers"" at the company focused on removing positive/negative bias from interviewing and ensuring they ""Raise the Bar"" with each hire. 

2. How Amazon has stuck to the same principles laid out by Jeff Bezos in 1994. This clearly shows a very deep running corporate culture which is difficult to compete with. 

3. Continued growth mindset, focusing on Customers rather than Stock holders. Even as a stock holder myself this pleases me. There are always stockholder interests and Amazon has always put it on the back burner, reinvesting profits and having a longterm strategy. This makes it one of the best growth stocks to own, as it is clearly still undervalued because of profits seeming to not exists, when its just being reinvested. 

4. Amazon Web Services. This is the largers Cloud Computing provider in the world and tops market share (31%) even over Microsoft Azure (20%) and Google Cloud(6%). Last year AWS was 13% of Operating Revenue but 71% of operating income. It's a key business in a market that's spiking. And 3rd party analysts like Gartner puts AWS down as the market leader for the past 10years.

Anyways those are just some high-level elements I covered during my analysis...but...I'm curious to hear others thoughts?

Are you invested in $amzn and if so, what are your top reasons or Amazon businesses for continuing to hold or buy even more? Or alternatively, if you're not investing in $amzn why not?

During the process, I charted AAPL, AMZN & MSFT for the last 15 years. I included share price, outstanding shares and assets into the charts (links below). 

All three companies experience exponential growth in their stock price as expected. What I find interesting is that Microsoft's outstanding shares have decreased in a somewhat linear fashion by roughly 30%. For Apple, outstanding shares increased slowly till around the time Steve Jobs died (figures) and then proceeds to decrease linearly for a total reduction of about 30% as well. On the contrary, AMZN has increased shares by 20% over the same period of time!

Now i'm curious what it all means?!

It's worth noting that AMZN's assets are seeing (what seems to be) exponential growth whereas microsoft is linear and apple when from a linear growth to a slight decrease for the past few years.

Is Besos creating that much more of a monster by creating shares consistently along the way so that the company has insane asset growth?

For those preferring a more concentrated portfolio style, I think this is an interesting question - because these are all great companies, but naturally one must be better than the others.

If you had to pick just one of the mega-caps, which do you buy today?

My personal thoughts:

- Facebook. I see potential competition to their network, but the balance sheet is a fortress and valuation has been pushed down a bit due to general public hatred. A contrarian pick. (B)

- Apple. In my opinion the valuation of this has run away farther ahead of its earnings relative to the others, making it the least attractive of the bunch for me. (C-)

- Amazon. Doing amazing things, looking at the last several quarters their earnings seem to be accelerating - however the p/e is higher than all the rest. (A-)

- Microsoft. The sleeper choice, solid valuation in addition to growth. Not flashy but a money printer. (A)

- Google. My perception is that they're slipping - taking lots of high risk/high payoff bets that don't appear to be paying off yet. Feels potentially contrarian but I'm not wildly excited. (C)?

- Bonus: Mastercard/Visa. Secular trend away from cash makes these seem like long term great picks, in spite of fin-tech disruptors. Not cheap valuations though. I favor MA over V for efficient use of capital. (B+)

2020-07-29 07:19:06,"$AMZN - analysts expect Thursday's Q2 to beat on revenue, but less optimistic about margins","**Goldman**: *""We expect Amazon to report results well above consensus expectations on revenue and profitability (Exhibit 1), given stronger than expected performance across all businesses, particularly NA Retail. We expect 3Q guidance to fall above consensus on a revenue basis and inline/below on operating income as the company accelerates infrastructure investments to accommodate sustained growth in customer demand and avoid showing outsized profitability during the current crisis. The net increase in demand across all segments of Amazon’s business and Amazon’s ability to meet the challenges of this demand is, we believe, serving to steepen the curve of its long term growth rate, drive incremental profitability, and further deepen its competitive moats. While the stock has outperformed the majority of Internet significantly YTD, we believe the market continues to underestimate the long-term value of the Amazon platform as the leader in both the movement of retail online and compute into the cloud, the realization of which is being accelerated by the current crisis. Therefore, we continue to believe Amazon represents the best risk/reward in the Internet sector and remain Buy-rated (CL) with a $3,800 12-month price target.""*

**Jefferies**: *""Expectations are high heading into Q2 results on Thursday, w/ AMZN up 65% YTD and 34% since Q1. We expect AMZN to deliver, but prefer to focus on how recent changes in consumer behavior provide attractive long-term opportunities given most of the nearterm acceleration is priced in. We would also point to attractive valuation despite the YTD move, w/ current 28x NTM EV/EBITDA standing roughly in-line w/ 2017-18 despite a larger mix of high margin businesses.""*

**Barclays**: *""Buyside expectations for Retail revenue growth ex-FX are likely in the range of +40% Y/Y (vs. consensus +29%) and AWS “low 30%’s” Y/Y (vs. consensus +32%), and we expect largely in-line results. We also expect guidance to reflect some normalization in growth in late 3Q, similar to what the company guided 90 days ago, but also factoring in the shift in Prime Day to 4Q. There are few companies better positioned for the current environment than Amazon. Prime members rely on Amazon more than ever for essential and discretionary purchases, and few retailers have earned the trust and reliability that Amazon enjoys. Disruption with global supply chains, store closures, and Covid-fear among consumers has created a perfect storm whereby there seem to be few places other than Amazon where one can receive goods reliably and on time across 100m+ SKUs. The question we ask ourselves constantly is: how much longer can this dynamic play out, and what happens when growth trends normalize? June came and went without much deceleration for Amazon or ecommerce as a whole, despite economies re-opening (behavior appears to have changed semi-permanently in terms of the shift away from brick-and-mortar). At 20x 2021 EBITDA, the same level we were at before Covid, the risk/reward remains attractive.""*

**Telsey**: *"" We are raising our sales forecast for 2Q20 (up \~1% to \~29% to $81.6B) and 2020 (up \~1% to \~25% to $349.5B), given our view that Amazon has been seeing strong demand of both essentials and discretionary products. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift to online, which combined with US Government stimulus checks, temporary retail store closures, and ongoing retail consolidation, should generate solid results. In addition, the usage of advertising, music, movies, and gaming subscriptions is on the rise. Amazon Web Services (AWS) also should see sales accelerate, given the shift to cloud computing and remote offices/classrooms. That said, we are lowering our 2Q20 and 2020 profit forecasts due to incremental costs (including over $4B in 2020) related to COVID-19—unfavorable product mix, productivity headwinds from social distancing, investment in personal protective equipment, and higher wages and logistic costs, including faster delivery.""*

**Canaccord Genuity**: *"" We forecast \~27% y/y total revenue growth for Amazon in Q2 as the company likely saw accelerating growth for its online stores as a result of heightened eCommerce demand during the pandemic. We expect operating margin to be around breakeven, as management plans to reinvest virtually all of its Q2 operating profit into COVID-19-related safety initiatives and to ensure fulfillment efficiency.

2021-02-04 05:39:29,10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.  Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why:

1. THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, [https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq](https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq) .  The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work).  Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO.  A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs.  Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade.
2. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, [https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/](https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/) .  This ETF is... highly intriguing.  It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%).  They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM.  Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily).  What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology.  Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit.  The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO.  The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB.   SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF.  Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive.  Index methodology here: [https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf](https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf)
3. DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl) .  Its methodology is in the prospectus, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus) .  Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to [etfrc.com](https://etfrc.com). So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way.  Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ.  Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF!
4. SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund) . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change.""  ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s) ).  Methodology here: [https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index](https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index) .  It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in.  It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year!
5. FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, [https://freedometfs.com/frdm/](https://freedometfs.com/frdm/) . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores.  Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red.  If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like.  Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF.  Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox!
6. EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund) . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index.  Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil.  It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all).  Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung.
7. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf) .  One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets.  Really heavy on tech and luxury.  If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like.  High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH.
8. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, [https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html](https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html) .  Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options.  Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times.  Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF.  Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement.  Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X.
9. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, [https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx) .  Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries.  But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure.  Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund.  There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design.
10. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf) .  This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF.  You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise.  But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values.  Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk.  A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields.

ok, here's a bonus #11:

11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA) .  This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year.  But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted.  US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along.  Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector.

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future.

What do you guys think?  Any of those look like something you might invest in?  Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?

2020-09-15 09:23:53,"$AMZN - Morgan Stanley raised estimates, expecting $30-60bn of freed up ""experience spend"" to shift to e-commerce this holiday","Morgan Stanley:

""We raise our macro e-comm and AMZN forecasts, expecting the $30-$60bn of monthly freed up ""experience spend"" to continue shifting to e-comm this shelter-in holiday. Scale, record fulfillment efficiency and ramping high margin revs leave us 40%+ above Street EBIT even with a large assumed '21 build.""

""Experience Spend Shift + Shelter-in Holiday Shopping Season = Raising E-commerce Forecast (Again): We remain keenly focused on the continued shift in consumer spend away from experiences – travel, live events, amusement parks, bars/restaurants – toward e-commerce…as our bottom up analysis shows how there is likely to be \~$30-60bn of monthly “experience spend” up for grabs for the remainder of ’20 even as the world re-opens. We see these experience dollars shifting toward shopping, further fiscal stimulus (modeled in October), and a socially-distanced holiday shopping season (with less mall shopping and more online shopping) now leading to 43% 2H:20 e-commerce growth (vs 33% previously).""

""As We Now See '20 as a 3 Year E-commerce Pull Forward, But Expect 9% E-commerce Growth in ’21: We are starting to be asked more frequently about our ’21 e-commerce forecast given the looming difficult growth comps, expected re-opening and reversal in spend back toward experiences. The answer is we now model 9% e-commerce growth in ’21…as we think shelter-in place will have pulled forward \~3 years of e-commerce adoption in '20.""

""We now turn to 3 reasons AMZN, the e-commerce leader, remains among our top picks into 4Q and ’21.

1. We Expect AMZN to Drive and Benefit From This Still-Inflecting E-commerce Spend. Given our faster US e-commerce growth forecast, we raise our ’20/’21e AMZN revenue by 2%/2%, now expecting '20/'21 US GMV (ex Whole Foods) to grow by 47%/18% Y/Y. The shift of Prime Day to October should give AMZN a leg up to capture more holiday shopping dollars in this holiday season that is likely to be more ""sheltered in,"" and face stock-out and macro shipping challenges.
2. But To Us The Next AMZN Story is Profitability...As Scale and Fulfillment Efficiency Drive 40%+ EBIT Revisions Even Through Investment: In our view, AMZN’s reported 2Q $2.36 fulfillment cost per fulfilled unit (est $1.64 ex 1-time Covid costs) gave us a glimpse into how efficient its network can run with very high utilization and without large investment spend. This ex Covid cost per unit is the lowest we have seen in over 34 quarters of data (1Q:12). On an annual basis, we now model fulfillment cost per unit (ex Covid/Bad Debt) to fall by 14% in '20. To be clear, we do not expect these levels to continue, modeling investment in future growth ahead (50% fulfillment/sortation square footage growth this year); indeed, we are also proactively putting in a large investment/build in '21 as we raise our '21/'22e fulfillment costs today by \~4%. The fact that we still find ourselves 51%/41% above Street '21/’22e EBIT with this build gives us higher confidence in expected upward revisions ahead. And if 2Q fulfillment efficiency levels prove to be more sustained, bear in mind that every $0.25 (10%) change in fulfillment cost per fulfilled unit would add \~10% to our ’22 EBIT.
3. With High Margin Revenues Also Scaling...and 3 Reasons to Remain Bullish AWS Growth: AMZN's ramping high-margin revenue pools (AWS, advertising, Prime subscription revenue) further enable the company to compete, invest and deliver improving profitability. As shown in Exhibit 15 , we see this \~$30bn EBIT dollar pool adding 2x more EBIT dollars in '20/'21/'22e than they have in the prior 3 years. AWS is one of the biggest contributors here as we remain bullish AWS' '21 growth outlook for three reasons. 1) We believe this downturn is already causing more large non-tech enterprises to re-evaluate their on-premises data center architecture and accelerate their move to the public cloud. 2) AMZN’s accelerating performance obligations growth (similar to bookings for AWS) speaks to new multi-year business being won not yet in the income statement...and the successful execution from the growing AWS enterprise sales force. 3) We believe macro weakness associated with AWS’ travel, leisure and retail clients has been one of the main drivers behind the 1H:20 deceleration. While we expect that to continue into 2H, looking into ’21 a re-opening of activity for leisure clients (combined with a larger book of new enterprise business) should drive acceleration.""

""Lower '21'/22e EBIT by 5% Due to Assumed Higher Fulfillment Investment, But PT Remains $3,750: Rolling it all together, we raise our '21/'22e revenue by \~2% though lower our EBIT by 5% due to an assumed large fulfillment build. That said, we still see AMZN generating \~$44bn/$58bn of '21/'22e EBIT and \~$76bn/$95bn of EBITDA. We remain OW AMZN with a sum of the parts-based $3,750 PT (\~20% upside) and note that our $3,750 PT implies \~20x '22e EBITDA, in-line with the historical trading average of 20x NTM EBITDA.""",44,0.89
2020-10-01 09:33:25,"$AMZN - Jefferies gets ""logistics expert"" to analyze Amazon's fulfillment network","""We hosted a conf call with a supply chain / logistics expert to discuss the current state of AMZN's fulfillment network. Key takes: 1) Increased customer demand is causing AMZN to expand capacity at an unprecedented pace, 2) Expanded same-day delivery could be just 12 months away, 3) AMZN is taking over delivery for legacy carriers, 4) Recent moves in grocery suggest AMZN is shifting to a self-distribution model, with potential to drive margins higher.""

""**AMZN is expanding fulfillment capacity at unprecedented pace**, adding 2.25M sq ft per week, or the equivalent of \~40 football fields. AMZN's footprint has grown by \~53M sq ft (+33%) in the U.S. alone between March through September, and our expert believes could reach an additional 117M sq ft by the end of 2020. Our expert estimates another 36M of sq ft is already planned for 2021, but could end up being significantly more. To put this level of expansion in perspective, WMT operates just over 140M sq ft of DC space in the U.S., which took \~50 years to build. Interestingly, a large portion of this new capacity was already planned prior to the pandemic.""

""**Expanded same-day delivery could be just 12 months away**: Our expert believes that AMZN is building out same-day capabilities by morphing its traditional delivery stations into hybrid facilities (opening up to 700K sq ft facilities vs traditional 100-150K sq ft) that can handle the dual function of being a delivery station and fulfillment center. The strategy helps bypass sortation centers, cutting down on time and costs, with an initial focus on fast-moving consumer goods (top 30-40K SKUs) within the top 50 metro areas. Currently, AMZN operates 336 delivery stations, which are expected to grow to \~430 by year-end and to 1,000-1,500 over time, enabling AMZN to eventually reach 85% of the U.S. population. Our expert believes these capacity additions may position AMZN to announce expanded same-day delivery offerings within the next 12 months.""

""**AMZN is disintermediating third-party carriers**: Our expert estimates Amazon Logistics will handle 5B+ packages in the U.S. during 2020 (or 67% of total), double the \~2.5B packages handled last year (or 50% of total). For comparison, our expert estimates UPS and FedEx will handle 5.3B/3.1B packages in the U.S. during 2020. As AMZN builds more delivery stations and moves closer to 85% coverage, a diminishing portion of volume will go through third-party carriers. Once AMZN's network reaches full scale, our expert believes UPS will be primarily handling “out-of-region customers” (where AMZN does not have any facilities) and USPS will be handling low-density parts of the country.""

""**AMZN is making initial moves toward self-distribution in grocery retail**: In an industry characterized by economies of scale, AMZN is taking initial steps to compete more effectively against the leaders in grocery by becoming a more efficient and profitable operator. AMZN recently leased a 1.1M sq ft grocery distribution center in Orlando, Florida. Eventually, our expert envisions AMZN building a nationwide network of 10-12 dedicated retail grocery distribution centers, which would involve a capital investment of $1.5-2.0B over the next 5 years.""",16,0.78

The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

2020-10-06 08:18:38,"$AMZN, $GOOGL, $FB - RBC data suggests Amazon biggest gainer of ad share","RBC:

""RBC & Ad Age surveyed over 700 advertising professionals – marketers, agency representatives, marketing consultants & media companies. We believe this constitutes one of the broadest Internet Advertising surveys out there. And we track the Advertising Troika: Current Budget Allocations, Future Spend Intentions & ROI Perceptions. **We increasingly view these survey results as indicative of trends for larger Brand-oriented advertisers.**""

""1. **Evidence of a Modest Recovery**: Looking at how marketers plan to adjust their Online Ad spend over the next 12 months, 61%/6% plan to increase/decrease, up slightly from 60%/7% in April but below the 67%/3% from last year. We believe there is a lag effect here given our last survey was taken while ad budgets were in major flux during late March / early April.

2. **High Social Commerce Adoption, Notable Social Media (SM) Ad Boycott Impact**: 42% of SM advertisers said they had spent some budget on Social Commerce tools (e.g. Facebook Dynamic Product Ads, Instagram Shopping Ads, etc.), which we view as intrinsically high and especially bullish for FB & PINS. Meanwhile, a meaningful 33% of digital marketers halted or reduced spend on SM because of recent ad boycott campaigns, which may help explain the downtick in SM allocations and directionally negative results for FB and INSTA. All in, we tend to view the boycott results as generally backwards looking and Social Commerce results as more forwards looking. We continue to expect minimal impact to FB’s fundamentals from the boycotts given their advertiser base of 9MM.

3. **‘Net Remains A Key Marketing Channel**: 76% of marketers (vs. 75% last year) allocate >20% of their budgets to Online, and a Record High (RH) 42% allocation 50%+ to Online. This 42% of respondents allocating over half their budgets to Online marks the 13th consecutive new RH allocation in this bucket of spend and supports our view that incremental ad spend will continue to go to Online channels.

4. **FB & GOOGL Properties are ROI and Budget Allocation Leaders**: When asked to rank order Online Ad platforms based on ROI, marketers continue to place GOOGL and FB well ahead of peers, with GOOGL moderately increasing its lead over FB. Platform partners YouTube and Instagram rounded out the top four with Twitter, LinkedIn and Amazon trailing, respectively. In terms of Budget Allocations, 38% of marketers allocate over 20% of their Online Ad Spend to Google (vs. 38% in April), ahead of Facebook at 37% (flat vs. April). These levels are much higher than other platforms. 76% (+1pt Y/Y) of marketers allocated some Online spend to INSTA with 75% (+2pts Y/Y) allocating some to YouTube, tho both had sequential allocation declines. In terms of Future Spend Intentions, Amazon had the most positive skew for the first time in survey history with 52% of its marketers planning to increase spend vs. only 3% planning to decrease. After Amazon, the skew was most positive with Google, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, then Pinterest, with Facebook, Twitter and Snap lagging.

5. **And The Trends: Strongly Positive for AMZN & PINS, Incrementally Negative for FB & INSTA, Modestly Positive for GOOGL & YT, and Neutral-to-Negative for TWTR & SNAP**: AMZN is now the #1 ranked platform in terms of Future Spend Intention (vs. #3 in April and #5 last year) and the #1 ranked Perceived ROI platform (vs. #3 last survey). It was one of two platforms to show six and twelve month improvements in these metrics and was the largest sequential gainer in both of these categories. Super Bullish. PINS was the other platform with six and twelve month gains in Future Spend Intention and Perceived ROI skew, including record best results in both categories (see Exhibit 14). FB & INSTA were undeniably negative with group high deteriorations in Future Spend Intention skew (both down 11pts vs. April) and a RL +6% Perceived ROI skew for FB. GOOGL led Top 5 platforms in terms of Future Spend Intent and Perceived ROI, showing a sequential increase in the % of respondents indicating improved ROIs. TWTR results were more neutral than anything (tho intrinsically weak) while SNAP was negative, posting deterioration in these two metrics and Future Spend Intention skew turning negative.""",18,0.75
2020-05-02 18:33:03,"How will GOOG, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL and FB ever lose value?","I really don't get it. Every period had its well-running stocks like in the nifty fifty.   
But nowadays I don't say any reason why those companies would loose somehow their value. Can anyone give me a few scenarios besides government regulations?  
I mean take GOOG, FB, AMZN and partly MSFT. They all basically have huge monopolies, let's say not including China.  
GOOG and FB and somewhat AMZN are basically data mining, means the more data they have, the more valuable they get. How should they ever lose value as they are monopolies and get more data over time? I just don't get it.",39,0.71
2021-02-28 19:29:31,Lindy Effect and Valuations," Some of you might have heard of the [Lindy Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect). Essentially, however long a given technology or idea has existed, it will probably exist for a time proportional to that.

The thing that strikes me is that equity valuations are a story we tell ourselves, an idea. Although the market is in the long run a weighing machine (weighing intrinsic value), it is made of human participants that believe and reinforce stories. Does the Lindy Effect hold for equity valuations? Not valuations in general, but potentially for specific industries or stocks.

For example, AMZN has traded at a hefty premium to the market for quite some time. Personally, I kick myself for not diving in earlier, but it just never seemed rational to pay close to 100x earnings ever. But AMZN continues to demand a premium. Some might say that this is because of the consistent growth, but what if it's just a story that keeps going?

Consequently, does it make sense to look at time weighted valuations? Does it make sense to look at volatility of multiples? Potentially, a traditionally overvalued company might be stable at that multiple and continue to demand a premium, signaling that it is OK to buy at the current level as long as one's other requirements are met.",20,0.85
2020-08-03 10:45:02,AMZN - what’s the next leg for Amazon,"I am surprised that it’s losing steam after that blowout ER. It’s had a nice run from 2700 but can’t seem to reach ATH at 3300+. Even with upgrades to 4000, it’s acting like like it wants to go back to 3000. 

Any thoughts on Amzn?  IMO, it will make another run later in the year in anticipation of holiday sales. Aapl seems to be the mega cap that will continue to run.",11,0.62

2020-06-16 01:11:03,$AMZN want to $WORK,"A couple of weeks ago, on June the  1st,  an internal memo advised around 45k AWS employees that, starting  from the next day, they would have started using Slack as their main  official internal chat. Most of AWS employees have already been using it  for unofficial purposes, but thanks to the new Enterprise license they  can now handle direct support for their high-tier-customers and  obviously internal conversations.

Slack  Enterprise packet costs around (mean) $75 per month/per user. Adding  AWS employees (not counting Amazon and affiliated companies full force  for now) adds up to (around) $40M per year to $WORK revenue, which is  about 10% of 2019 revenue or 7%  of 2020 estimated revenue.

At  the present moment, as discussed in other posts, the main competitors  in the business chat field are $MSFT Office and  $GOOGL Suite, leaving  $AMZN with its Chime (internal) videochat solution, which is going to be  fully integrated in Slack. For this purpose a new internal memo advised  the Chime developers that they would soon be joined by new workforce to  pursue the aforementioned integration. Of course we also know that  these are the three main opponents in the cloud business field as well  (Azure, GCloud and AWS).

One of  the main stakeholders in $WORK is $SFTBF, which is now facing some  exponential losses within its startup investments (e.g.: WeWork,  Brandless, Oyo). On the other side we have $BRK exposed on $AMZN (though  arriving too late as per Mr. Buffett words) and, course Mr. Bezos  himself.

With these conditions as a  whole, reviving a two-year-old prediction, $WORK is in the perfect  place at the perfect time to become part of $AMZN by the end of the  summer.",34,0.74
2021-01-07 21:27:17,"If you only get 3 stocks to buy and hold for the next five years, what are they?","I’d pick the following:

1 - AAPL. Solid innovation, product pipeline, cash on hand, and consumer network. Services business will continue to grow and they could jump into other highly profitable categories as well, thanks to robust cash balances and R&D teams. 

2 - TSLA. Still a lot of upside. Yes the valuation is crazy high, but they continue impress consumers and investors. They used to be mistaken as a software company that wishes they were a car company. Now people confuse them for a car company. They are far and away the worlds leading sustainable energy company and nobody is close behind them. 

3 - TTD. Lots of good growth this past year, but tons of runway in the digital streaming ad space. It’s TTD or Google. I like what TTD has to offer. Solid mgmt team.

Honorable mentions. NIO, NCNO, UPST, ADBE, SHOP, MSFT, PYPL.",26,0.61
2020-10-01 21:08:10,Fun fact: if the original AT&T (pre-1984) was still around AMZN would have a market cap 3x higher than it and TSLA would be bigger,I get these numbers by adding together the market caps of AT&T and Verizon which together would be the original company. That makes me question the valuations of some of these mega cap tech companies. You mean to tell me that TSLA is worth as much as a company with a monopoly on all phone service and with a deep media library with the merger from time Warner? I don’t know. I just can’t see the justification for it. And yes I know T and Verizon are burdened by debt and would probably have much higher market caps without it but to be it boggles the mind that a company that makes 350k cars a year (smaller than GM in the 1930s) is more valuable than an utter monopoly on phone service. Perhaps I’m missing something here but it’s giving me big 2000 vibes.,0,0.38
2021-02-11 14:20:00,Surge by Disney+ to nearly 95 million subscriptions leads to surprise profit,"[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/disney-earnings-surge-in-disney-subscriptions-leads-to-surprise-profit-11613078561?siteid=yhoof2](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/disney-earnings-surge-in-disney-subscriptions-leads-to-surprise-profit-11613078561?siteid=yhoof2) 

“Disney+ has exceeded even our highest expectations,” Chapek said in a [conference call with analysts](https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/snvice4i) later, noting it stood at 26.5 million subscribers in the same-quarter a year ago. He also noted spikes in usage for ESPN+ (up 83% to 12.1 million) and Hulu (up 30% to 35.4 million).

Disney’s Media and Entertainment Distribution, which includes Disney+, brought in $12.66 billion for the quarter, a decline of 5% from the same quarter a year ago before the pandemic swept across the country. The Disney Parks, Experiences and Products unit took in $3.6 billion, down 53% year-over-year as many Disney parks and its cruise line remain closed. The flagship Disneyland Park in Anaheim, Calif., and Disneyland Paris will stay closed in the current quarter, Disney Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said during the analyst call.

The retailer’s sales totaled $22.3 billion in the three months ended Oct. 31, a $3.9 billion increase from the same period last year. By comparison, the chain’s increase in sales for the entire preceding fiscal year was $2.7 billion. In other words, in the third quarter alone, it had to figure out how to manage the equivalent of a more than a year’s worth of growth. And that’s after experiencing a huge sales increase in the second quarter. It’s an utterly herculean operational lift — requiring a rethinking of supply chain, inventory management and labor models — and it bodes well for Target’s long-term prospects that it was able to adapt to these conditions so quickly.""

1. Anti-trust debate - the benefits of large companies is being clearly demonstrated during this crisis - FB's apps enabling the sharp increase in communication, AMZN's logistics delivering critical goods to consumers, innovative health apps and 1m masks/week from AAPL. The rise of TikTok and Zoom also illustrate large companies are not stifling competition. In fact, they have allowed Americans (voters) to live better lives during this pandemic.
2. Privacy debate - data collection has driven rapid innovation during COVID (e.g. thermometer apps tracking virus spread across the US by location). Countries that appear to have greatest success at containing COVID-19 also have the most aggressive data gathering tools (e.g. China, Singapore).
3. fake news debate - FB and GOOGL have been proactively taking down false info during COVID-19, which appears to be helping their case to policy makers.

I work in the auto repair industry. Our franchise saw an insane boost of traffic following the closure of the walmart auto care centers. Some of which remain closed as walmart took a low-risk approach to covid. Rightly so, because many of the people who have been working on cars have caught covid. They're just not reporting the cases. It's one of those fields that flew under the radar in regulation.

I believe that as walmart ramps up the re opening of their auto care centers, they're earning reports are going to skyrocket. The wal mart auto care center is the largest competition in regards to automotive repair as they do offer some wildly low prices on shit. 

The fact they have done so well after shutting down such a major function of their stores shows they have thrived in other areas. I see walmart becoming a formidable competitor to Amazon as they use their current delivery service (using their subsidized postmates) to pivot into the market.

2020-10-29 13:16:44,"Amazon beats, Earnings: $12.37 vs $7.41 expected, Revenue: $96.15b vs $92.7b expected","(CNBC) Amazon reported better-than-expected third-quarter results after the bell on Thursday, including soaring profits and 37% revenue growth.

The stock bounced around in extended trading after Amazon provided a wide guidance range for the fourth quarter.

* **Earnings:** $12.37 vs $7.41 per share expected, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv
* **Revenue:** $96.15 billion vs $92.7 billion expected, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv

Amazon  said sales in the fourth quarter will be between $112 billion and $121  billion, which comes out to growth of 28% to 38% from a year earlier.  Analysts were expecting revenue of $112.3 billion. 

The company  forecast operating income of $1 billion to $4.5 billion, assuming about  $4.0 billion of costs tied to COVID-19. That's a step up from the second quarter,  when Amazon said it would spend more than $2 billion on  coronavirus-related measures, including procuring personal protective  equipment, enhanced cleaning of its facilities and wage increases. 

Amazon  continues to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic, as  consumers flocked to the site for essential goods, groceries and  household items. Amazon is expected to face even greater demand heading  into the holiday season, with shoppers likely to do the bulk of their  gift buying online instead of making trips to the store.

""We're  seeing more customers than ever shopping early for their holiday gifts,  which is just one of the signs that this is going to be an unprecedented  holiday season,"" Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement.

Bezos  also touted Amazon's recent job creation and treatment of warehouse  workers, which has been a subject of scrutiny in recent months. The  Amazon CEO pointed to Amazon's $15 minimum wage and challenged other  large employers to ""make the jump to $15.""

Amazon is one of few companies that has continued to grow its headcount  amid a broader economic downturn due to the coronavirus crisis. The  company now counts more than 1.12 million full-time employees across the  globe, an increase of 50% year over year. That figure doesn't include  Amazon's network of contractors and temporary workers. 

Amazon's cloud-computing unit, Amazon Web Services, generated  sales of $11.6 billion for the quarter, up 29% year over year and in  line with analysts' estimates, according to FactSet. Operating income in  the segment of $3.54 billion topped estimates of $3.45 billion. The  segment was helped by millions of people working from home.  

The  company's ""other"" category, which is primarily comprised of its  advertising business, saw revenue of $5.4 billion, up 51% year over  year. Subscription services, which includes revenue from Prime  memberships, climbed 33% year over year to $6.58 billion.

Once  again, third-party sales grew more than Amazon's first-party business.  Third-party sales increased 55% year-over-year, while first-party sales  grew 38% year-over-year. Sales fell 10% in Amazon's physical store unit,  which includes Whole Foods Market.

Amazon shares are up 74% this year, the best performance among the five most valuable U.S. tech companies. 

Three of those companies — Apple, Alphabet and Facebook — also reported quarterly results after the bell on Thursday and all exceeded analysts' estimates.

Amazon will hold a call with investors to discuss its third-quarter results starting at 5:30 p.m. ET.

2021-02-12 10:08:51,The incentive to short TSLA is just massive at this point,"Ok guys, let's throw away the year-old arguments about valuations and  modelling and how TSLA's price is 10-20x what it should be even not  accounting for all the competition that it might have in the future.

At this point the only key measure to look at here is **market cap:**  we are looking at a $768B company, almost $1T. In case you haven't noticed, there aren't a lot of companies thare are worth significantly    more than that. Only  AAPL, MSFT, AMZN and Saudi Aramco thare are worth  more than double the price of TSLA, and they are all cash cows with massive amounts of actual real profits and fat margins, something that  Elon Musk doesn't have.

Even if TSLA stock rallied heavilyin the next months, it could as well double and go into the same league as those blue chips, but **REALISTICALLY,  it's not a 10 bagger potential ANYMORE: do you actually believe that  there would be LITERALLY TRILLIONS of dollars flowing into this stock?** Because to increase its price we need those numbers at this point.

Really  think about the people that could buy TSLA at this point, basically  everybody knows it's a massive bubble, and it's much easier to justify  taking  that massive risk if you know you could be in for a multibagger  upside wise, but  it's not easy given the relatively small upside of  today.

Having said all that,  there needs to be a catalyst. In the next few years, as competiton in  EV and autonomus driving space starts to thicken, we  might  finally see  a meltdown ...

**What do you guys think about this?**  I might be wrong and many hedge fund legends  have  lost billions  shorting this stuff, but at this point the poop smell is just too much.  Burry shorted this a couple of months back, he  predicted  2008, he  predicted Game Stop, he might be right on this  too.

The  other interesting point is that if TSLA falls, it might take  down the  entire market with it, or at least a good portion of the  NASDAQ",30,0.72
2021-01-31 17:40:45,Markets Look Like They’re in a Bubble. What Do Investors Do Now?,"WSJ Article Below! What is everyone's thought on this?  Ever since the markets recovered from the crash in March, I find all stocks are overpriced but I don't know if this means that we're in bubble. Could just mean investors are optimistic? 

Article starts here:

Markets Look Like They’re in a Bubble. What Do Investors Do Now?

For once, everyone seems to agree: Much of the market looks like it’s in a bubble.

Shares of unprofitable companies like GameStop Corp. GME 67.87% and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. AMC 53.65% are rising at a breakneck pace, propelled by a growing army of individual investors. Options activity is surging, bitcoin prices are near records and businesses are rushing to opportunistically sell stock through a flurry of initial public offerings, listings of blank-check companies and follow-on share sales.

To many, valuations look stretched as they hover at levels similar to the highflying days of 2000. That said, high valuations alone don’t necessarily mean the rally is near its end, investors say. History has shown that markets have often been able to climb far longer than thought possible, be it the dot-com boom in the late 1990s or the dizzying rise in Japanese stocks in the 1980s.

And recently, the broader stock market has been on the decline. The S&P 500 dropped 3.3% last week, though it remains up 66% from its March low. The bubblelike behavior there has mostly been contained to a handful of individual stocks, not larger indexes.

Single-Stock Bubbles

Fast-moving stocks such as GameStop, AMC Entertainment Holdings and BlackBerry have raised concerns of excessive exuberance in pockets of the market, while the S&P 500 largely remains unchanged.

An even bigger issue arguing against a marketwide bubble is simple math. With interest rates at rock bottom and further stimulus on the table, many investors are being handsomely rewarded by putting their money into riskier, higher-yielding assets. What’s more, in many cases earnings have held up or been robust, despite a global pandemic.

That combination of factors has helped push investor optimism. Bullishness on stocks among money managers is at a three-year high, according to a recent Bank of America survey of 194 money managers who oversee $561 billion in assets. Meanwhile, the average share of cash in portfolios—typically a safeguard against market turmoil—is at the lowest level since May 2013.

Nonetheless, investors are trying to identify what could cause bubbles among individual stocks to pop and whether any of the bursts will spread to the wider market. Next week, investors will get a look at fresh data on the manufacturing sector, earnings from Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -0.97% and Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG -1.47% and the January employment report.

“You know, this one has checked off all the boxes from a history book,” said Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of Boston money manager Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Co., who predicted the market crashes of 2000 and 2008. Mr. Grantham has been calling the current market overheated since last year.

But even he concedes the timing of a market top is difficult.

“We know each bubble is a little bit different and, with the help of new trading platforms and the internet, it could set more records,” he said.

Mr. Grantham isn’t alone in his worries. Nearly 90% of some 627 market professionals think some financial markets are in a bubble, according to a recent Deutsche Bank survey. Meanwhile, Google searches for the term “stock market bubble” reached an all-time high in January.

Jerry Braakman, chief investment officer of First American Trust, says his company, concerned about stretched valuations in the U.S., has been gradually shifting more money into stocks elsewhere.

Lately, “the market has not been correlated to the macro picture,” he said.

New Year Anxieties

Google searches for 'stock market bubble' reached an all-time high in January.

While the moves of some stocks and assets have been jarring, analysts and investors say they aren’t surprised by the freewheeling, speculative activity in the financial markets.

A super-accommodative Federal Reserve, low interest rates and, more recently, optimism on the coronavirus vaccine and economy have underpinned much of the buying by investors during the past 11 months. Many Americans built up their savings during the pandemic—and stand to gain even more if Congress follows through on another stimulus package. And the prospect of low returns in most other assets has driven investors to buy stocks more aggressively.

Add to that, more individual investors are trading than ever before. Those investors threw their weight around last year by shocking Wall Street veterans with a rash of irrational stock picks, including Hertz Global Holdings Inc., HTZGQ 7.36% which spiked nearly 900% from its low to its high in the wake of filing for bankruptcy protection.

This year’s encores have been even more stunning. On Wednesday alone, 24.5 billion shares and 57.1 million options contracts changed hands, a record driven by individual investors, according to Rich Repetto, a managing director in Piper Sandler & Co. GameStop shares more than doubled that day, briefly giving shares of the beleaguered videogame retailer a more than 1,700% gain since the year’s start.

“This is merely one example of what’s becoming dozens of dozens,” Mr. Grantham said. Other retail darlings include AMC, which jumped more than 300% Wednesday, and BlackBerry Ltd. , whose stock the same day notched its biggest gain in more than 17 years.

The Blank-Check Boom Poses Pitfalls for Investors

The Blank-Check Boom Poses Pitfalls for Investors

Private companies are flooding to special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, to bypass the traditional IPO process and gain a public listing. WSJ explains why some critics say investing in these so-called blank-check companies isn’t worth the risk. Illustration: Zoë Soriano/WSJ

Companies are rushing to get in on the action.

Companies have raised $13.4 billion through 24 IPOs so far this year, a 300% jump in listings from the same period last year, according to Renaissance Capital data. Blank-check companies continued to flood the market, with 91 gathering about $25 billion, nearly a third of the value raised throughout all of last year, according to SPACinsider.com. And there have been 111 offerings of additional shares by U.S.-listed companies, doubling the number from the same period a year earlier, Dealogic data show.

Usually, such frenzied activity would lead big money managers to pull back from stocks. But many argue that shares of GameStop, AMC and other highflying stocks represent their own bubbles—and don’t pose a threat to the entire financial ecosystem. Analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS -1.40% say the run-up in unprofitable stocks, which they say make up about 5% of the overall market, poses little risk of contagion.

“These stocks don’t make up the bulk of the stock market,” said Samantha McLemore, a portfolio manager at $3.5 billion money-manager Miller Value Partners. “There are so many areas of the market that we’re finding attractively valued.”

At first glance, investors’ go-to for measuring valuations, price-to-earnings ratios, suggests the market looks expensive.

The S&P 500 currently trades at 22 times projected earnings during the next 12 months, not far off from the 25 times the index traded at in 2000, just before the dot-com crash, according to FactSet.

But that’s only part of the picture. That level looks less concerning once low interest rates and earnings, which are expected to grow, are factored in, several investors and analysts said.

One simple explanation for why investors haven’t pulled back more?

“We’ve seen it in the past—if you think you have a bubble and sell too soon, that can be a very costly trade,” said Mr. Braakman of First American Trust.

2021-03-01 13:14:06,Coupang sets $27-to-$30 price for U.S. IPO," 

* South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang ([CPNG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CPNG?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) expects to price its hot upcoming U.S. IPO at $27 to $30 a share, potentially raising $3.6B and reportedly valuing the company at as much as $51B.
* Coupang, which many view as South Korea’s answer to Amazon (NASDAQ:[AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)), disclosed in a [revised S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1834584/000162828021003511/coupang-sx1a1.htm?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) Monday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it will sell 120M shares of stock. The company hadn’t revealed the initial public offering’s expected price range or number of shares in its [original filing](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4406838-coupang-files-for-1-billion-ipo?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) last month.
* At $27 to $30 a share, Coupang would see a $46B to $51B market cap. That’s way up from a $9B valuation seen when the company last staged a private fundraising round in 2018.
* Coupang was founded in 2010 by Harvard Business School dropout Bom Kim, and is generally ranked as South Korea’s No. 1 e-commerce platform.
* The company aims to beat Amazon and other competitors with several unique features, such one-day and same-day delivery, and even what Coupang calls “Dawn Delivery.” That’s a program where orders placed by midnight arrive the next morning by 7 a.m.
* Coupang also boasts ecofriendly packaging, with 75% of deliveries coming without boxes. Instead, the company uses “eco-bags” that it picks up later and reuses.
* Lastly, Coupang promises “friction-free returns,” allowing customers to simply sign up for returns online and leave goods at their doors without boxing up and labeling items or paying for postage.
* “Our mission is to create a world where customers wonder: ‘How did I ever live without Coupang?’” the company wrote in its IPO prospectus.
* Coupang added in its S-1 that revenues have grown 400% in less than three years, from $900M in 2018’s first quarter to $3.8B in 2020’s fourth period.
* However, Coupang lost $474.9M in 2020, although that’s way down from the $1.1B of red ink it had in 2018.
* SoftBank’s Vision Fund was an early backer of the firm and will own about 37% of Coupang’s Class A stock following the IPO. Other pre-IPO investors include BlackRock and Greenoaks Capital Management.",53,0.83

1. **Walmart still cheaper than Amazon, but less so than before** \- *""The price for the July branded basket of 30 items at Walmart was $112.35, $14.58 lower than the $126.93 basket at Amazon (see page 4). Since we began this portion of our pricing study, the Walmart basket has been cheaper in 44 out of 47 months. This month, 19 items were also included on March's list. For those 19 items, Walmart's advantage decreased from 23% in March ($15.15 cheaper) to 17.4% ($11.41 cheaper) in July. To note, while Walmart's prices were fairly similar, Amazon's prices decreased across multiple items versus our last survey in February. For Walmart grocery delivery, the individual items are priced the same as online grocery pick up and in-store (no markup), while the customer pays a $9.95 for a same-day delivery fee ($7.95 during ""less busy"" times). Accordingly, on an “apples-to-apples” delivery basis (including the $9.95 delivery fee), Walmart’s July basket was 3.8% ($4.63) cheaper than Amazon Prime Now. ""*

At 1 p.m. in our local market we attempted to place an order through Walmart grocery delivery and Amazon Prime Now delivery. Amazon had three delivery slots available with two-hour delivery slot windows (the soonest was five hours from the order time), while Walmart had no delivery slots available the same-day but had 9 one-hour delivery slot windows available the next day (Tuesday July 21st). That said, Walmart has experienced*

But if you ignored them and just held your positions, you would have earned 16.4%.

It's worth adding that the operation costs weren't included in that equation, as well as capital gain taxes.

My biggest problem when it comes to investing is trying to find that one gold advice, that would help me make 500% returns. On Reddit there's plenty of TSLA yay and nay sayers, AMZN fanatics and opponents, AAPL fan boys and haters who will try to convince everyone around why their opinion is the most valid and accurate. 

Fuck 'em. Do your own research. Look at the company earning reports. Look at the political climate and try to deduce how the company may react to it. Commit and don't look back. 

Sure, it's good to see what's new once in a while, learn what other people think. But basing your financial moves on other people, even if it's Warren Buffet will make you lose money in the long term.

2021-02-23 05:48:35,"A ""Stocks for Inflation"" ETF and value factor discussion","I think that two Fidelity ETFs deserve more attention.  Each is under 5 years old with an ER of 0.29%, each had a regularly scheduled rebalance just a day ago (so it's a good time to evaluate holdings), and each makes novel contributions to the factor ETF space.

&#x200B;

1. **FCPI, Fidelity Stocks for Inflation ETF:** [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FCPI](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FCPI)

Methodology here: [https://research2.fidelity.com/pi/Content/Documents/RebalanceSchedulesPDFs/Fidelity%20Stocks%20For%20Inflation%20Factor%20Index%20Methodology.pdf](https://research2.fidelity.com/pi/Content/Documents/RebalanceSchedulesPDFs/Fidelity%20Stocks%20For%20Inflation%20Factor%20Index%20Methodology.pdf)

Described on page 5 of the methods doc, the ETF tracks an index that screens for value, quality, and momentum of stocks (a set of 11 total metrics, which I like for inflation protection due to the emphasis on free cash flow).  However, it also slightly biases sector weights (5% each) depending on historical correlation of sector performance with inflation.  So you get more weight on commodities-centric stocks, fewer tech and consumer discretionary stocks, etc (see page 7 of methods).  Its performance in the past year hasn't been amazing (it has been like VTV), but, inflation concerns did not really ramp up until very recently.  Also, the ETF index was reconstituted effective Monday, February 22 (see methods).  So if it's going to outperform a total market ETF, it's set up for it right now.  This is a small ETF by AUM and volume, so keep an eye on bid/ask spreads if you're dipping into it, but man, super appealing right now!

Having a look inside, you need to examine the daily holdings document since it was rebalanced more recently than the end-of-January summary holdings.  That's here: [http://fundresearch.fidelity.com/prospectus/eproredirect?clientId=Fidelity&applicationId=ETF&securityId=316092386&securityIdType=CUSIP&critical=N](http://fundresearch.fidelity.com/prospectus/eproredirect?clientId=Fidelity&applicationId=ETF&securityId=316092386&securityIdType=CUSIP&critical=N) .  Top 10 holdings currently include:

AAPL, MSFT, EQT, WMB, EXP, NEM, CC, PG, GOOGL, PM.  Thus, it's heavy on free-cash-flow tech, oil/gas, materials, and consumer staples.

&#x200B;

2. **FVAL, Fidelity Value Factor ETF**: [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL)

Methodology here: [https://research2.fidelity.com/pi/Content/Documents/RebalanceSchedulesPDFs/FMR\_US\_Value\_Focus\_Methodology\_publicFNL.pdf](https://research2.fidelity.com/pi/Content/Documents/RebalanceSchedulesPDFs/FMR_US_Value_Focus_Methodology_publicFNL.pdf)

Many ""value factor"" ETFs have a near-exclusive focus on price/book ratio and earnings (or sales) to price.  This one is different in that is specifically calls out free cash flow yield and earnings to enterprise value metrics, which are also metrics that DSTL (the ""Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF"", another modern value/quality ETF @ [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl)) weights highly.  In fact, these value metrics are also used as the ""value"" metrics for FCPI. FVAL is not a simple ""value or growth"" classifier like some S&P or CRSP value/growth factor ETFs.  It has consistently outperformed Vanguard's value ETF, VTV, probably as a result of using methods that can better reflect the effects of intangible value.  It was also rebalanced effective Monday, Feb. 22.  I think that this is the sort of ETF that may also outperform the market if meme growth tech stocks stagnate or there is mild inflation.

Its top holdings do include free-cash-flow tech starting with S&P 500 stalwarts AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL and FB.  Many ""value"" ETFs will not be holding those tech leaders!  But after that that, FVAL takes a bit of a turn; one thing you won't find in either FVAL or FCPI is Tesla.  But FVAL does have classic value stocks such as Berkshire Hathaway and JNJ in its top 10.

When reality sank in that the massive stimulus bill was not going to be easily passed in the senate, the cyclical rally hit a pause -- suddenly tech was looking cheap, and NFLS’s earnings post market on Tuesday lit the fire. Interest rates too held steady – the 10 year closed around 1.10 and didn’t douse the fire.

Next week is a very busy week with 20% of the S&P expected to report earnings. I do expect the tech rally to continue, though not at the same blistering pace; many will sell on news and take profits. I own all the FAAMNG’s and will sell small portions to book some profits. However, they remain a fairly large part of my portfolio and barring anti-trust government action, I don’t see any secular threats. 

I’m still bullish on cyclicals, value and small caps. I bought Toyota Motors, (TM), General Motors (GM) and Ford (F), besides increasing positions in US Foods (USFD) and Performance Group (PFGC). The autos deserve some of Tesla’s sunshine - sure they’re far behind in technology and branding but the gap is too wide and presents opportunity. I like USFD and PFGC, they’re food distributors and post vaccination and lifting of lockdowns – people will release their pent up demand for eating out.

2021-01-23 22:52:20,Market Commentary (How about that GME and BB craze? Where are we in the market cycle? ) - 1/23/2021,"Hello investors,

(for pictures, please refer to the original post)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/l3ugu7/market\_commentary\_how\_about\_that\_gme\_and\_bb\_craze/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/l3ugu7/market_commentary_how_about_that_gme_and_bb_craze/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Wow... Like everyone else, I'm mesmerized by the stratospheric price action in the past few days. Look at the below numbers.

&#x200B;

GME (GameStop) made so many people happy and wealthy. Congratulations to everyone who participated in this amazing movement!!

GME has been the topic of conversation for literally every single robinhooders and traders. 

I'm sure by now that most of you are familiar with what happened to GME but for those who don't know, the short story is that the market markers and the short-sellers were ""squeezed"", aka forced, to close/hedge their positions.

These positions would have helped drive the stock price down in the past but since they closed them now, those downward pressures have evaporated. This basically lifted the ceiling and then the price skyrocketed.

I know this phenomenon has created bipolar views on the stock markets right now. 

One group of people are advocating for the continued run-up in GME, BB, and PLTR (the folks on the next door) by squeezing the market makers and short-sellers, while the other group of people are talking down on those ""yoloers"" who are acting crazy and irrational.

The reason why I'm mentioning GME? For two reasons:

1) I see an asymmetric opportunity in these crazy stocks. 

2) It serves as an important indicator for the overall market conditions.

**1) In my view, there is a good risk/reward situation in GME, BB, and so on.**

To preface my argument, I like to consider myself very conservative, risk-averse, and value-oriented investor. I emphasize on fundamentals, the stock price playing true to the company's earnings, and the actual cash flows.

I'm very like-minded with those group of people who think this GME run-up is crazy and irrational.

However, many people forget that being a ""rational"" investor doesn't mean you should just ignore those hot tech stocks, crypto-mania, or GME price action.

As a ""rational"" investor, you also don't need to feel jealous and anxious about those people who became wealthy from GME. I would like to go even a step further to compliment them for getting in at the right time.

Afterall, we are playing a game of probability. 

If your friends or neighbors win lotteries in millions of dollars, should you feel jealous? Should you feel the FOMO? Absolutely not. No one could've seen this coming and some people do get lucky. You can't blame a guy for winning a jackpot.

Now, let's talk about what actions we can take to benefit from this situation.

The way I look at it, we now have confirmed that lots of short-sellers in GME and BB have already realized their losses, aka covered their shorts. 

The market makers also have realized losses from their gamma squeeze, which is a more complicated concept but to simplify, it means that the downward pressure on the stock has weakened.

It's rather a simple idea. We are looking at a situation where the stock can move further up due to the lifting of these ceilings. 

If I had to put numbers, it would certainly be more than 1:1 payout ratio but more like 3:1 ratio.

Why wouldn't anyone participate in a game of blackjack that gives you 3x or 4x your money?

To be extremely clear, I mention blackjack because buying these stocks is pure gambling, nothing more. It is not ""investing"".

Yet, it's gambling where the odds are tilted in our favor and thus, risk/reward is relatively high.

Therefore, I have bought BB calls for 2% of my portfolio, specifically BB because the short interest is lower than GME.

Furthermore, I'm going to try to be cute and buy more GME call options come Monday. 

I would think that GME price would tank on Monday due to the excessive price run-up last Friday so that creates a buying opportunity.

If I lose that 2% BB? I'm totally okay with that. If it goes up 5x? Lucky me.

ONLY BET AN AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU ARE OKAY LOSING!

&#x200B;

**2) What do all of these tell us about our current position in the market?**

Typically, these types of manias are observed during market-tops. 

Howard Marks and David Einhorn list out the typical signs of market-tops.

1. Initial public offering mania
2. High valuations and new metrics for valuation
3. Market concentration in a single sector and a few stocks
4. S&P 500-type market capitalizations for second-tier stocks that most people haven’t heard of
5. A situation where the more fanciful and distant the narrative, the better the stock performs
6. Outperformance of companies suspected of fraud based on the belief that there is no enforcement risk, without which “crime pays”
7. Outsized reaction to economically irrelevant stock splits
8. Increased participation of retail investors, who appear focused on the best-performing names
9. Incredible trading volumes in speculative instruments, like weekly call options and worthless common stocks
10. **A parabolic ascent toward a top.**

(for those who don't know Howard Marks, I highly encourage to follow his ""memos"" on his website [https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/howard-marks-memos](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/howard-marks-memos). He is a legendary bond investor.)

Of the above ten signs, roughly all of them describe the situation today very well.

We are seeing IPO mania, high valuations, market concentration in a few stocks, outsized reaction to economically irrelevant stock splits, increased participation of retail investors, incredible trading volumes in speculative instruments, and parabolic ascent toward a top.

It's no doubt we are ""near"" the market top. But how near? 3 months, 1 year, 5 years..?

How can all of these happen in less than a year after the steepest GDP decline in history?

The answer is monetary and fiscal responses. 

I mentioned in this commentary ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/knxgex/market\_commentary\_2021\_outlook\_12312020/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/knxgex/market_commentary_2021_outlook_12312020/) towards the bottom) that right now, the two biggest driving factors in the markets are the gov't and the JPow & Co. 

The government is spending like there is no tomorrow, which makes total sense because it is much more dangerous for our economy to under-spend than over-spend.

Jerome Powell is also providing massive purchases of Treasuries and zero rates policy, for the foreseeable future.

As long as these two massive forces are in action, we will see even a greater hype and craze in the markets.

We just started a bull-market run. Look at the below graphs.

Given the fact that we just started a bull market and also observed lots of bubbles happening everywhere, I believe that we will see one of the greatest bubbles in history (if not already) until every last one of those the market bears are proven wrong. 

W**hen every single person at the cocktail party is expecting a market rally, it is at that moment that the market is truly at the top and the bubble bursts.**  

That doesn't mean that market corrections of 10% or more can't happen in the meantime. In fact, I have been saying that there will be market corrections in the very near future and we should be ready for that as well.

To summarize today's post, I would say there are opportunities in these maniac stocks and we should take advantage of them with limited risks. The manias also indicate that we are near the top of another market cycle and we should closely monitor the actions of the government and JPow & Co.

&#x200B;

**Quick report card for 2020**

Below post was my first market commentary one on Reddit, where I said I was bullish on tech names (BABA, PDD, STNE, FUTU, AMZN, FVRR, W, and SEDG).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/jtaze1/market\_commentary\_11122020/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/jtaze1/market_commentary_11122020/) 

I've gotten winners and losers, the losers being BABA and W. The winners were the rest. 

Obviously, I would've never thought that FUTU would double in less than a month. I held call options on them but it was pure luck. 

I also called for rise in long-term treasury yield. Although I got the direction correct, the yield curve took way longer than I expected to steepen significantly. Now, I am even more bearish on the 30-year than before due to the rates breaking the technical levels.

I was also long gold. I have unrealized losses on this one but I plan on getting back in as this is a 2-3 year play.

2021-02-04 14:35:13,Investment DD: Payoneer (FTOC),"Just to be upfront, I view Payoneer as a great long-term hold. I started acquiring PayPal shares in 2016 and haven't sold since. I see some parallels with Payoneer but patience is the key. This is not really a r/SPAC play as much as its a r/investing play. (No comment on r/WSB.) While getting added to ARKF would be nice for a near-term pop, sometimes lying low to get your act together is a good thing. PayPal benefitted from the same dynamic until investors realized the company's scale was enormous. (Obviously, the eBay relationship played a huge role but the stock traded in the $80-110 range for two years before Covid drove the stock up 3x.) There will come a point when investors realize Payoneer's opportunity, but right now the opportunity is buried under mediocre financials (see below) and a frothy SPAC market for which anything less than a 50% pop at DA is a dud.   It's only when you dig deeper into the potential scale benefits and where the current investments are going that you realize this may be PayPal 2.0. **Hence, thee current situation is actually a great opportunity for Payoneer investors.**

Obviously, I would encourage everyone to do their own DD starting with the investor [presentation](https://pubs.payoneer.com/docs/investor-presentation.pdf?_ga=2.142077554.1186770460.1612586492-2042252415.1612359068) and [webcast](https://viavid.webcasts.com/viewer/event.jsp?ei=1426630&tp_key=f7e0f9ea11). I personally found the presentation short on key metrics and financial detail and long on buzz words. (I guess $95mn in bankers' fees only buys so much these days.) That said, the acquisition has yet to close and Payoneer needs to be prudent. I would also add that while I avoid stereotypes, Payoneer seems to be another addition to Israel's strong lineage and tradition of building great technology companies where the MO seems to be under-promise and over-deliver.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**Payoneer (FTOC)**

**Summary:** Payoneer offers investors exposure to mobile and digital commerce, particularly cross-border transactions, at a reasonable entry point. What makes the investment compelling is that Payoneer has been around for 15 years, which removes a fair amount of execution risk related to growth, i.e., the team knows what they're doing. The company is also investing in providing additional services for its customer base which should contribute to growth and strengthen its competitive position.

IMHO the key for the company (and the stock) is to better explain the customer ROI at the unit level and why investments now make sense from a CLTV sense. The company also needs to address flattish margins on 25% revenue growth and negative EBITDA after 15 years of operations. I think the company missed an excellent opportunity to frame the discussion out of the gate by highlighting the benefits of its scale with detailed customer metrics, e.g., subscriber acquisition costs (SAC), churn, and most importantly customer lifetime value (CLTV). These are really the metrics which matter to thoughtful investors as well as the usual financials. If this was an obvious play, it would be trading significantly higher. (Un)fortunately, most investors don't like complexity or have the patience to watch a good company become a great company. I think this may be a situation where really digging into the financials and business model could reward investors handsomely over time. That said, far more DD is needed as well as much more disclosure from the company before one can make a decision. I would encourage investors to take a modest position and then build on it as the DD validates.

The acquisition is expected to close within the first half of 2021 at which point detailed financials should be available.

**Company:** Payoneer is Paypal for B2B global commerce, particularly outside North American and Europe. The company provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises around the world. In 2020, the company recognized $345mn of revenue (31% Y/Y growth adjusted for the pandemic) on $44bn of transactions. The company was founded 15 years ago and operates in over 190 countries (basically the whole world).

**Customers:** Enterprises and SMB. The ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network.

[This](https://mingclee.medium.com/payoneer-how-to-sustain-its-success-in-the-super-competitive-chinese-market-9b7eda21cf35) blog post does a nice job of discussing Payoneer's entry into China, which looks promising. My concern with China is exactly what's happening, namely, the competition is driving down the price. PayPal entered with a 5% fee and the industry is now around 1%. The post quotes  a VC who aptly sums up the situation:

>[*You don’t have to be the first, but you need to be better, cheaper and faster.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opkHJLVAM4A&t=182s)

This dynamic obviously has margin implications  and also illustrates why higher-value services are important longer-term. Expect WorldFirst and AirWallex to continue to further drive this dynamic.

I need to comment on Payoneer's customer service, which based on a perusal of r/Payoneer leaves something to be desired. First, the Wirecard scandal caused Payoneer to move to an Ireland-based bank, which has pretty [onerous documentation requirements](https://www.reddit.com/r/payoneer/comments/ku38y4/whats_up_with_payoneer_recently/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Clearly this has [upset](https://www.reddit.com/r/payoneer/comments/j1e7n6/payoneer_is_a_shit_company_with_zero_customer/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) a fair amount of vendors. I have no idea how many were impacted as a % of the total customer base but enough to warrant attention. I'm hoping this is a [transitory issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/payoneer/comments/lbkz4x/this_platform_still_rocks_for_freelancers/gm1vukg?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) but it obviously needs to be monitored. Second, the payments industry like the broadband industry is one in which if the service is not delivered seamlessly, customers will gripe to no end. (You hate your cable company but you NEED BB. You know it.) The only thing worse than BB latency is cash latency, i.e., a delay or freeze on your account. Clearly, the industry as a whole needs to do better. I can attest firsthand that vendor complaints about PayPal have reached a deafening level. However, as one disgruntled vendor notes, it's basically a two horse race. There is no third option. Assuming that's the case, I like Payoneer's position given its lower fees and better service on a relative basis than PayPal. Again, I want to see customer service scores moving in the right direction. No question. But the industry has come a long way from Western Union.

**Customer service.** After spending some time on the [r/Payoneer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Payoneer/) sub-reddit, I have two initial impressions.

* While the Wirecard scandal caused a headache for Payoneer’s customers, it seems to be a transitory issue.
* The Wirecard scandal aside, Payoneer’s customer service is less than perfect and needs to improve. (Note: few people go out of their way to praise a bank or their cable company for seamlessly delivering the services the customers pay for. Please keep that in mind when browsing [r/Payoneer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Payoneer/).)

**User feedback.** I would very much like to thank [u/-Jack-The-Lad](https://www.reddit.com/user/-Jack-The-Lad-/), who provided some really great insights into his experience using Payoneer as a vendor based in Europe.

* Payoneer offers vendors the ability to move money with a U.S. bank account and pay suppliers, without having to deal with too many banking hurdles or red tape.
* A lot of freelancers on [Upwork.com](https://upwork.com/) use Payoneer because many of them live in countries that [Upwork.com](https://upwork.com/) can't wire money to.
* Once vendors receive funds into their Payoneer account they can either withdraw the cash using their Payoneer provided Master Card or do a direct bank transfer from Payoneer to their local bank. Usually funds arrive within 1-2 business days.
* Vendors can also pay suppliers directly through wire transfers and pay for services like hosting using the MasterCard. *However, customers can't fund their Payoneer account.* While Payoneer likes the reputation of being ""a U.S bank account"" they really are not. They are a service that allows you to receive payment from companies. While individuals can send money from and to other Payoneer accounts, wire transfers to the account can only be done by a business.
* As a result of the Wirecard scandal, Payoneer now gives customers the option to choose to hold their funds on their MasterCard or on Payoneer own accounts.
* From [u/-Jack-The-Lad](https://www.reddit.com/user/-Jack-The-Lad-/): “Overall I think Payoneer is a good company. They have a lot of room for expansion and their market is beyond huge. One thing I am concerned about is the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny. As Payoneer grows, it will likely get noticed by countries and may face stricter regulations both in the U.S and abroad.”
* Fellow customer u/[tonysoleoptions](https://www.reddit.com/user/tonysoleoptions/) notes that Payoneer offers a no frills currency exchange service while is reliable and dependable. In terms of areas for improvement he cites the slower transaction times relative to PayPal and less than optimal reporting.  

**Industry and market opportunity:** B2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, “scale” and “network effects”. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they’re benefitting from these dynamics but the disclosure could have been better (more about that below). Analysts estimate the global B2B market at tens of trillions $ and cross-border payments at $300bn. Obviously the pandemic only accelerated these trends. (From the presentation, it looks like company B2B AR/AP volume more than doubled at 140% in 2020 although the CFO later cited a 53% increase in volumes so not sure exactly how to interpret that.)

**Management team and investor base:** Betsy Cohen led FTOC and has extensive expensive in the FinTech space, including leading previous SPACs and founding Bancorp Bank. Scott Galit has experience at MasterCard and First Data, which is exactly what you want to see.

As this [Barron's article](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/why-a-fintech-chose-to-go-public-with-a-spac-hint-its-the-money-and-the-partner-51612568216) notes (h/t  [whmcpanel](https://www.reddit.com/user/whmcpanel/)), unlike with an IPO, the sponsor and institutional investors get to look at the financials before making an investment decision. This is a crucial distinction for two reasons. First, you need to choose your SPAC carefully because you're relying on the sponsor to do thorough due diligence (DD). Second, if quality institutional investors participate, it generally means they like what they saw in their DD. On both accounts, Payoneer looks promising. Betsy Cohen is an industry leader in FinTech and Payoneer's institutional investor (II) base is high quality with IIs such as Dragoneer, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Millennium, T. Rowe, and Winslow Capital Management. Wellington Management, an existing investor, also participated. These are IIs who understand FinTech and like what they saw in their DD, which is an encouraging sign. 

**Business model:** Volume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and are expected to grow at 44% and 33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth  per year for the next two years. I would say all else equal flat revenue growth vs. decelerating volume growth is a good thing but again a deeper dive into the product mix is necessary. The key here is that these growth rates are higher than the overall market so Payoneer appears to be taking share but again more DD is needed.

While the transaction margins have been growing, the company forecasted margins to remain flat at 72% for the next two years. I believe this forecast is due to a change in the blended take rate but unfortunately the company really didn’t elaborate here. I would have expected the revenue growth to drive some incremental margin expansion but I’m clearly missing a piece of the story. This may be an issue for investors. That said, the CFO offered long-terms targets of +20% revenue growth and +20% EBITDA margins. I was also surprised the company wasn't EBITDA positive given how long it's been around but I need to see how much of the costs were investment or subscriber acquisition related.

As for the all-important unit-economics, the customer payback period is less than 12 months, which is nice. Disclosing CLTV would have been better. The company also noted net volume retention (i.e., same store comparison of customer Y/Y volume) is over 100% but did not disclose exactly what the percentage is. This is somewhat irrelevant since anything less than 100% and the company wouldn't be getting acquired. I found the SMB cohort volume on slide 27 interesting. While it's lacking a Y-axis for volume (ugh!), it's clear each year's cohort of customers are roughly following a similar trajectory although 2015 seems to be a slight outlier. Now, if the company would just disclose the unit economics for these cohorts, you'd have your investment decision made. I think at this point, you have to trust the quality of FTOC and the II's DD. As I suggested above, my guess is that they drilled down pretty heavily and liked what they saw.

Finally, many are looking at Payoneer’s transaction fees to get a sense for the potential revenue opportunity. While this is logical, it is somewhat misleading because these services are considered low quality revenue as I note above (cf. the race to sub-1% fees in China). Similar to the CDN business, where moving traffic is a commodity while providing web acceleration and cloud security offer higher margins, Payoneer needs to upsell higher value added services to its customer base, which was initially attracted by the low service fees. Once again, Payoneer highlighted these value added services in its presentation

Note: the adjusted numbers were a turnoff. Covid happened. If you're benefitting from the acceleration in cross-border traffic due to the pandemic, don't exclude those sectors or markets negatively impacted by said pandemic. I believe the company was done a disservice by its bankers here in trying to manipulate the numbers. Investors aren't stupid and if they are, they're not the ones you want. This massaging of the numbers coupled with the lack of PF shares outstanding is a little concerning. It's early and the deal isn't completed yet so I'll give management the benefit of the doubt. For now.

**Valuation:** FinTech companies such as PayPal, Square, and Payoneer are valued on subscriber growth. The key metric which the analysts will judge the company on is customer lifetime value (CLTV), which is an NPV of the total cash flows from each customer over his/her/its lifetime. (Analysts apply a similar approach to wireless companies and data center REITs where each new subscriber or data center build is viewed on a payback and NPV basis. Technically, these companies are valued on earnings, EBITDA or AFFO but its CLTV or customer NPV which determines the valuation multiple.) Counterintuitively, once the company reaches a certain scale and growth slows, the margins and FCF will improve but the analysts will become concerned that growth is moderating even though the financials are improving. (That's when the smart money will bail.) Again, CLTV is the name of the game and is the primary way to evaluate companies such as Payoneer. There's a reason why the company included different cohort growth rates and mentioned a less than 12-month customer payback in the presentation. These are the metrics that matter.

Based on FTOC's current share price of \~$13.50, Payoneer's current market cap is roughly $6bn, which assumes \~430mn total shares outstanding.\* (This is a SWAG as management did not include a pro forma cap table with shares.) The current valuation implies an enterprise value (EV) to revenue multiple on 2021 revenue in the mid-teens, which is much closer to global payment processors such as First Data than digital payment and ecommerce companies such as PayPal, Square, and Shopify. FTOC shareholders will own 19.2% at closing. Finally, there is a management earn-out of 30 million shares at the $15 and $17 mark which will dilute existing FTOC shareholders but comes with 10-25% upside from current levels.

* The initial valuation assumed an enterprise value (EV) of $3.3 billion, which equates to 7.6x EV to 2021 revenue. Just to clarify, FTOC was negotiating a CASH investment, i.e., the $755mn raised at IPO and held in trust, not an acquisition with its shares as currency. FTOC's pro forma ownership of 19.2% for a $755mn equity investment roughly equates to the pro forma market cap of $3.8bn mentioned in the presentation. Yes, there is some dilution from the sponsor's promote and the 30m shares in earn-out but I would argue that FTOC got a fair price for its investment as evidenced by the fact that FTOC shares are trading +30% above NAV.

**Investment Thesis:**

1. **Majority of traffic stays within the network.** In my opinion, this is the key company metric because it reflects how valuable the network is to its customers. This metric continues to increase for Payoneer.
2. **Exposure to digital commerce and mobility trends.** As everyone realizes, this is a big and growing market which the pandemic accelerated.
3. **Global network provides network effects and is difficult to replicate.** The benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer’s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company’s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky.
4. **Playing the long game.** The company’s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It’s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Specifically, working capital is far and away the most important service and something SMBs are desperate for. I can tell you based on several years in the VC industry that this is their number one issue. You have the funds for payroll but they're tied up in A/R. This is where Payoneer is currently focused and I think it will represent a significant competitive advantage relative to its competition. I would love to see Payoneer partner with an institution like SVB which caters to small and emerging companies. Expect M&A to figure into the company’s strategic plans as well.
5. **Quality Sponsor and II's.** As I noted above, Payoneer has a blue chip II base who performed DD not available with an IPO. These IIs clearly liked what they saw. Investors should certainly do their own DD but note that there is some impressive names in the II base, which is encouraging.
6. **Attractive valuation.** Payoneer’s valuation is much closer to global payment processors than digital payment and ecommerce companies. The negative EBITDA, flattish transactional margins, and ""adjusted"" revenue are certainly issues and need to be addressed. However, as noted above, Payoneer needs to be viewed in the correct context to value it appropriately. While the company doesn't merit PayPal's multiple given it doesn't have its growth or scale (yet), the company is certainly benefitting from scale/ network effects and deserves a multiple which reflects this. I expect the valuation multiple to rise (or ""expand"" in WS parlance) as the business becomes better understood within the investment community and the company posts a few solid quarters of earnings results. I feel like this is more ""a when rather than if"" issue. Thus, the current valuation represents an attractive entry point for current investors.

**Risks:**

1. **Competition.** PayPal is a giant and only getting stronger as 4Q results testifies. The company has leveraged network scale effects to achieve a market cap rivaling MasterCard. Skrill is also well known in this space. MasterCard and Visa certainly play in cross border transactions but I don’t think they provide the level of services Payoneer does. Definitely need to do more DD here.
2. **Customer risk.** Related to the previous point, if Payoneer loses a large customer like AMZN, the stock will take a hit (cf AMEX walking away from CostCo).
3. **Regulatory.** Payoneer needs to navigate every country’s regulatory environment. The company has certainly done a good job but as the FAANGS can testify, the larger you get, the bigger target you become, e.g., Europe is trying to displace MA and V.
4. **Crypto currency.** At this point, everyone in FinTech better have a crypto currency strategy even if it's just allowing transactions in BTC. Crypto currency was made for seamless cross-border currency transactions which makes a crypto strategy doubly important for Payoneer.
5. **FX exposure.** I’m sure the company has a world class FX hedging team but I feel like this needs to be flagged given the scale of the business. Investors could unintentionally have FX exposure.

**TLDR:**  While the global B2B industry is fragmented, Payoneer is playing the long-game by transitioning from commodity service fees to high-touch and sticky value add services. The key metric analysts will focus on is CLTV which will benefit from the shift to these services. Moreover, Payoneer’s valuation multiple should reflect this transition by increasing (or “expanding” in WS parlance) as Payoneer executes on this strategy. I believe Payoneer will significantly reward LT investors at the current valuation with the caveat that far more DD is needed around competition and the financial model. I also would not be surprised if PayPal took them out given their $6bn market cap vs. PayPal's +$300bn. It would be a very nice complement to PayPal's existing business assuming the transaction past regulatory scrutiny. My advice is to spend more time digging and in the meantime acquire a small position upon which to build.

2020-12-21 04:10:51,Comparing YHOO AND TSLA,"Hi all

So now that TSLA is in the S&P let’s compare 

YHOO(1999) was part of the dotcom bubble, a bubble fuelled by the (in hindsight) mostly accurate assumptions that (a) cost of internet is going down (b) user count is going up (c) margins for profit are extremely good (d) economy of scale on the net is infinite. This lead to the assumption that YHOO and its ilk could potentially have a user base of [the world] and hence reap profits from 7bn users for essentially no cost of revenue. (900 PE valuation)

TSLA(2020) is part of the EV/disruptive tech bubble, a bubble fuelled by the speculation that growth of these disruptive industries can in some unspecified way achieve global dominance over existing market leader under the changing climate of (e)environmental policy, (f)government attitudes, and (g)exponential technical development. Unfortunately unlike YHOO it has a high base cost of revenue (manufacturing, research, retooling) and may run into the diseconomies of scale barrier that stymied the growth of many other physical goods companies due to a inherently high retail value of goods sold being a barrier to entry for new users. Arguably its one standout feature is (h)vertical integration something that has historically been successful during the early 1900s seen most prominently in the Trust monopolies (1300PE)

While YHOO and it’s Ilk fell precipitously other new companies that survived the tech bubble collapse (GOOGL, AMZN, FB, MSFT, AAPL, BABA) actually achieved the stated goal of (a-d) and became the largest market leaders seen since The AT&T and early 19th century Trust monopolies.

Are we looking at the next wave of companies coming into existence meeting the e-h criteria that will take over the world? Or is TSLA another canary set to die in the coal mine without any impact.

2020-12-01 12:12:42,Blackberry announces agreement with Amazon,"Been following BB for a while since they had some projects going with both Amazon and Microsoft.  The stock is having quite a big day so far, up 25% as of this moment.

Today, they announced the following:

>Today, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), and BlackBerry Limited (NYSE: BB, TSX: BB), a worldwide leader in intelligent security software and services, announced a multi-year, global agreement to develop and market BlackBerry's Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform, IVY. BlackBerry IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud.  Automakers can use this information to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences.

>BlackBerry IVY addresses a critical data access, collection, and management problem in the automotive industry.  Modern cars and trucks are built with thousands of parts from many different suppliers, with each vehicle model comprising a unique set of proprietary hardware and software components. These components, which include an increasing variety of vehicle sensors, produce data in unique and specialized formats. The highly specific skills required to interact with this data, as well as the challenges of accessing it from within contained vehicle subsystems, limit developers’ abilities to innovate quickly and bring new solutions to market. BlackBerry IVY will solve for these challenges by applying machine learning to that data to generate predictive insights and inferences, making it possible for automakers to offer in-vehicle experiences that are highly personalized and able to take action based on those insights.

>BlackBerry IVY will support multiple vehicle operating systems and multi-cloud deployments in order to ensure compatibility across vehicle models and brands. It will build upon BlackBerry QNX’s capabilities for surfacing and normalizing data from automobiles and AWS’s broad portfolio of services, including capabilities for IoT and machine learning. BlackBerry IVY will run inside a vehicle’s embedded systems, but will be managed and configured remotely from the cloud. As a result, automakers will gain greater visibility into vehicle data, control over who can access it, and edge computing capabilities to optimize how quickly and efficiently the data is processed. With BlackBerry IVY’s integrated capabilities, automakers will be able to deliver new features, functionality, and performance to customers over the lifetime of their cloud-connected vehicles, as well as unlock new revenue streams and business models built on vehicle data.

>For instance, BlackBerry IVY could leverage vehicle data to recognize driver behavior and hazardous conditions such as icy roads or heavy traffic and then recommend that a driver enable relevant vehicle safety features such as traction control, lane-keeping assist, or adaptive cruise control. IVY could then provide automakers with feedback on how and when those safety features are used, allowing them to make targeted investments to improve vehicle performance. Additionally, drivers of electric vehicles could choose to share their car’s battery information with third-party charging networks to proactively reserve a charging connector and tailor charging time according to the driver’s current location and travel plans. BlackBerry IVY could also provide insights to parents of teenage drivers who may choose to receive customized notifications based on insights from vehicle sensors when the number of passengers in the vehicle changes, when the driver appears to be texting, distracted, or not observing speed limits, or when the vehicle occupancy level rises above the parents’ desired safety threshold. Similarly, parents of infants could receive a reminder to engage the child safety lock when the vehicle detects a child in the rear seat.

>BlackBerry IVY will enable automakers to compress the timeline to build, deploy, and monetize new in-vehicle applications and connected services across multiple vehicle brands and models. Instead of investing in one-off solutions that conform to the unique engineering of different vehicle models (as they do today), automakers using BlackBerry IVY will be able to leverage different types of data as common building blocks for new services that could work across a range of models. Automakers will be able to use the platform’s application programming interfaces (APIs) to share data and outputs with their software development teams, giving them the ability to innovate, while also protecting customer privacy and security by controlling whom can access vehicle and app data and at what level of detail.

>In addition, BlackBerry IVY will make it easier for automakers to collaborate with a wider pool of developers to accelerate creation of new offerings that deliver improved vehicle performance, reduced costs for maintenance and repairs, and added convenience. For instance, by analyzing real-time performance data, automakers could recognize the first signs of potentially faulty parts, deploy code to identify affected vehicles, notify impacted drivers, and perform targeted recalls. Automakers will be able to remotely deploy and update the software from the platform’s Cloud Console (a web interface for managing BlackBerry IVY) to continuously improve the functionality of the system.   

>“Data and connectivity are opening new avenues for innovation in the automotive industry, and BlackBerry and AWS share a common vision to provide automakers and developers with better insights so that they can deliver new services to consumers,” said John Chen, Executive Chairman and CEO, BlackBerry. “This software platform promises to bring an era of invention to the in-vehicle experience and help create new applications, services, and opportunities without compromising safety, security, or customer privacy.  We are pleased to expand our relationship with AWS to execute this vision and deliver BlackBerry IVY.”

>“AWS and BlackBerry are making it possible for any automaker to continuously reinvent the customer experience and transform vehicles from fixed pieces of technology into systems that can grow and adapt with a user’s needs and preferences,” said Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services, Inc. “Through this joint effort with BlackBerry, we will provide automakers with the insights, capabilities, agility, and speed they need to thrive in an increasingly connected world. As automakers seek to race ahead in their digital transformations, BlackBerry IVY empowers them to build their brands and set the standard for connected vehicle services across the automotive industry.”

When I bought it I just saw that it provides software for governments and allows patterns within datasets etc.

Basically I have read some articles and understood horse shit. Big data??

I have seen that they have made a contract with an oil company which will help that oil company save around $1B.

I know that PLTR is being extensively supported by the US govt and they won't enter the Chinese market, which means this company is never going bankrupt.

And knowing Peter Thiel, this could be something huge.

All I want to understand from you guys is how big a market PLTR is actually playing in? Which other companies do you think will eat PLTRs lunch(MSFT and AMZN seem very likely)?

And if PLTR actually manages to pull off its game, how could it be impacting our lives?

Then maybe 30% more risk averse stocks, some boomer stock like AMZN or MT or some E-commerce like ETSY. Maybe some ETF, like the ARK ETF?
The last 30% for more high risk stocks, maybe some Cannabis-Stock? Cannabis ETF? Tilray? Aurora? Maybe some cryptos? 

He gives me a year to proove that it is possible to make mad gainz in the stock market and wants to take my mom on a vacation like they've never been before.

I see an eerily similar situation with Tesla (people criticizing about profits).  Obviously it’s apples to oranges but profit isn’t the only metric to gauge future potential.  


Full disclosure- I’ve only seen critics of tsla profits randomly on yahoo and other random sites.

Counter point- Tesla has much more potential competition and is fighting a mature industry compared to amazon which was showing enormous growth in an infant industry (e- commerce and internet).

As to why tsla went from 300ish to 900ish so quickly, I don’t know.

**TLDR:**

In one sentence a TML is an institutional quality stock in a leading industry group with superior fundamentals and technicals. These are monster stocks which over the course of weeks and months increase +100% to +5,000% . These stocks are disruptors which change how we work, live, or play.

TMLs are popular with traders/investors whose methodology is based on the CANSLIM system developed by William O'Neil. He called them Model Book Stocks. Huge winners worth studying to identify common characteristics that they all share O'Neil studied over 1000 model book stocks going back to the 1880s. Many are shown and discussed in these must read books

* How To Make Money in Stocks, William O'Neil
* Monster Stocks: How They Set Up, Run Up, Top and Make You Money , John Boik
* The Lifecycle Trade: How to Win at Trading IPOs and Super Growth Stocks, Eric Krull, Kathy Donnelly, and Kurt Dail

**A few Historical Examples** from William O'Neil's How To Find & Own America's Greatest Opportunities

Apple 2003 [https://imgur.com/2Egn9z5](https://imgur.com/2Egn9z5)

Netflix 2009 [https://imgur.com/BHCtJpo](https://imgur.com/BHCtJpo)

Home Depot 1982 [https://imgur.com/tBU3JgU](https://imgur.com/tBU3JgU)

Qualcomm 1997 [https://imgur.com/oYPItOW](https://imgur.com/oYPItOW)

Yahoo 1996 [https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ](https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ)

**So what are the Fundamental characteristics of a TML? You want to see superior:**

* Quarterly Sales Growth > 25% YoY
* Quarterly Earnings Growth > 25% YoY
* Pre+After Tax Margins >20% Recent Quarters
* ROE >17%
* Annual Earnings Ests for the next year > 25%

And above all else you want the stock to have a great story- A new and innovative product or service that changes how we work live or play. Not every TML will have all of these criteria, but in general their record should be outstanding with regards to most of them. The higher these values the better. Earnings and Sales growth over 100% YoY is ideal. Annual Estimates for next year over 100% would be exceptional.

TMLs are also often in the Top 20 Industry groups at the times of their runs. The TML is the leader of an overall top group which is riding the tailwinds of changing environments. Recent examples $SE $SHOP $AMZN Retail-Internet and $TSLA $NIO Electric Vehicles (Auto Manufacturers)

Additionally base liquidity is required for these stocks to be institutional quality. Dollar Volume > $30 Million is essential and most should have DV much higher than that. Accumulation by big hedge funds and mutual funds like Fidelity Contrafund are what move the markets. They won't touch a promising stock unless it has liquidity.

**Now for Technical (Price Action) Characteristics of TMLs.**

They should be:

* Above a Rising 30 Week Moving Average
* Breaking out of a Stage 1 or Stage 2 Base
* Trending above Key Moving Averages (10, 21ema, 50sma)
* Volume and Price contractions within bases
* Up/Down Vol> 1.2
* Huge gaps up on volume after Earning Beat
* And most importantly they must be showing Relative Strength, meaning they are outperforming the vast majority of stocks in the market. This. is. vital.

During corrections and overall market weakness they should be near all time highs, above their longer term moving averages. They should be standing out like a sore thumb and yelling ""Buy me"". And during Market Uptrends they should be trending above the shorter term moving averages, forming sideways price shelfs during small pullbacks and then breaking out again. Most stay above their 50 SMAs and even 21 emas for extended periods of time.

**So how to scan for them:**

Use MarketSmith, the IBD Stock Screener, Finviz, or another screener and screen for the fundamental criteria mentioned above combined with the stock over the 200+50 SMA. It's helpful to have multiple screens splitting up the criteria for instance one scan for the earnings and one for sales.

Here is an example Finviz TML Scan: [https://imgur.com/a/CzwHdM8](https://imgur.com/a/CzwHdM8)

2021-01-09 06:24:34,The future of the big 5 US tech companies,"I read an article a while ago, that the big 5 tech companies GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, FB and AAPL fear regulations of data protection and security. They all gather big data and are exposed to regulations of the whole world through their global activities.

Europe already set the path for more regulations with GDPR and I believe it will extend. Companies will be forced to monitor and report more details to their activities and audits will cost them millions in administration.

The US, after the whole disaster going on with Trump, his followers and whatever other groups spreading misinformation, will for sure consider further regulations in the next 2 years.

I work in finance, and I see what administrative overhead regulations create. They make development expensive and slow. So I wonder if the big 5 will remain being longterm sure return investments or if this could be the beginning of a slow decline.

What are your thoughts on that?",5,0.63
2021-01-07 18:26:22,Stock Tip! Know of Founder-led companies with LOTS of fans?,"Congratulations to those that invested in SQ and TSLA and the like in 2019/2020.  I'm crowdsourcing ideas on what to ""invest"" in 2021.

Could you guys name publicly traded companies that match the following?:

1. Preferably, founder-led publicly traded company
2. (required) The company's product(s) and service(s) have SERIOUS / LOTS OF fans. Fanatic investors, consumers, or supporters - or all of the above.
3. (required) The founder has a cult-like following/ garners respect and hate from investors and users alike. If the non-founder CEO has a cult-like following, that counts, too.
4. Preferably, a consumer tech company; open to B2B tech as well and other non-tech consumer-facing companies.
5. Preferably, founded after 1999.
6. Can be Japanese, Chinese, American or European listed companies.

Context: I want to bet on companies with halo effect derived from hype. From retail investors to institutional investors to customers alike. Going to leave financial fundamentals behind a bit in 2021. No SPACs, unless the target is a company that fits the above criteria.

Here are one that I think fits the above:

* Examples that many ppl can likely agree on: TSLA, SQ, AMZN, SNAP
* Arguably: ROKU (personally don't know why ppl still use ROKU), NVDA, FB, TWTR
* Maybe: LYFT, W, CRM, ABNB, SPCE (since not many have gone to space yet lol)

Please share your thoughts! Would be very grateful. Can comeback to the post later with detailed transaction history on how this thesis performed in 2021.",13,0.74
2020-12-15 07:47:42,Short Term Profit Taking Considerations,"Profit taking. You're up a large percentage and you're afraid that the market will take your profits away as it's done many times. You're also afraid of selling too early and watching your position rise shortly afterwards, like it's done many times. How can you decide whether to sell or hold? Well, here are **a few things to think about.**

1- Selling on the news- Some good news comes out for your position and your stock pops 6 percent in the premarket. Now you should consider selling. Why? Look at a recent examples- Boeing's positive 737 Max news on Nov 18th. There was a large buildup in price in the days prior. (buying the rumour) The stock opened much higher at 223 and ended the session around 203. Example 2- Pfizer's positive vaccine news yesterday. The market sold the covid recovery stocks on the news. Cruises, airlines, and hotels all got rocked.

2- When your position has run up an insane amount in a very short amount of time and may be due for a pullback. Example- snowflake- in 4 days this stock went from 280 to 429. Now it's trading at about 317 a few days later. Any big moves like this should be viewed with suspicion. Example 2- XPEV- After nearly doubling in about 3 trading sessions, the stock plummeted from 74.49 to a low of 42.84 over the next 11 trading sessions. Example 2- Big Tech's massive rally from March to September. It eventually got too hot and [corrected.](https://corrected.It) It's December now and MSFT AAPL AMZN and others still haven't recovered. (google is an exception).

Also note that big upward swings attract the attention of short sellers (think Citron and PLTr) and momentum traders just looking to pump and dump. When this happens, don't think of it as an investment. You should be pumping and dumping too. The bigger the top, the bigger the drop.

3- Going into earnings or some big event that could have a big effect, especially highly anticipated ones and ones that could possibly go wrong. Example- (SPCE) Virgin Galactic's failed space mission. It dropped about 16% or something afterwards.

4- When the uptrend in your position breaks. (technical analysis) Example- NIO- The uptrend broke around the 50 dollar mark. This happened a couple of days after the high of 57. About a week later, it reached its low of 38.43.

5-When your position changes to a consolidation period. (technical analysis) Example- Tesla- spent about 2.5 months consolidating from September to mid November. You would have been better off taking profits at a higher level of the range and either getting back in when Tesla broke out again, or buying back in at a low level of the range and just holding and waiting (for patient people) Example 2- Amazon and MSFT are still consolidating since September.

6-Consider selling when Goldman Sach's upgrades a stock.

**Please note**\- I understand that many of the buy and hold investors here will be offended. But I also know that profit taking is something that many people here are interested in doing better. As I am.

With profit taking, there may also a time to get back in. Example- if you got out of tesla during it's consolidation period, you would have rightly got back in when it broke out again.

With profit taking, you can try to get every dollar. But your focus should be on catching the big move. Worry more about catching the big move, rather than getting out at the very top. It's more efficient.

Obviously there are plenty of counter examples to what I've said. And I've cherry picked examples to express my point. However my point is that these are **things to consider** in profit taking, not any hard fast rules.

I'm not a professional and I don't have a lot of experience. I'm an amateur trader with a shorter term mindset who spends a decent amount of time trying to figure these things out.

There will still be many times when you sell too early or don't sell when you should. It's all part of the game. Don't beat yourself up too much and try to learn from it.

Good luck with your trading.",43,0.88

2019-05-09 02:21:36,Is AMZN a strong “buy and hold forever” stock?,"Why I think AMZN is amazing:

Amazon is basically dominating every industry and doesn’t seem to be slowing down in trying to dominate more. It’s slowly but surely killing stores like Macy’s and JC Penney and even slowing down the growth of dominant delivery firms like Fedex and UPS. 

And furthermore, it’s not even trying to make a profits yet. It’s focused more on earnings growth. There are still many things that they can monetise further like AWS. Once Amazon becomes a habit in people’s life, they can start charging higher prices and make even more money. Amazon is less like a huge player in the game, and more like the game itself. It’s literally trying to be every company.

The only stopping AMAZON’s dominance seems to be the government. 

But why isn’t everyone stocking up on AMZN? When it’s obviously going to be the most expensive company soon?

The market cap can easily be the first company to reach $2trillion.

starting in april I bought lots of stocks that were hard-hit by COVID (as I bet that we would get a vaccine eventually):

As these are all cyclical tourism stocks (basically), the highs should generally be in August.

But since we will be fighting COVID for a good while longer, I guess it will take at least until Summer 2022 for them to regain their previous highs (hopefully)

These stocks are nowhere close to being recovered but I'm feeling FOMO as the stocks that I want to buy are just rising year after year (MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN basically)

(Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp COST.O recorded high coronavirus-related costs for the second straight quarter, overshadowing its better-than-expected results and sending the company's shares down 3% in extended trading on Thursday.

The warehouse chain spent about $281 million on employee bonuses and sanitizing its warehouses in the fourth quarter, mirroring a trend of rising costs across U.S. retailers during the health crisis.

Costco had estimated in May that COVID-19-realted costs would exceed $100 million, but would be lower than the $283 million incurred in the prior quarter.

“$281 million is over $100 million but quite a bit larger,” Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said on an earnings call.

The company cited the $2-an-hour premium paid to employees as a factor for the jump in costs. The bonus costs Costco $14 million a week.

“We’ve committed to doing that at least through, I believe, the first eight weeks of this fiscal quarter,” Galanti said.

Several U.S. retailers, including Kroger Co KR.N and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, have come under fire for stopping hazard pay for their workers.

Higher demand for fresh produce, appliances and gardening and sporting goods helped Costco’s total revenue climb 12.4% to $53.38 billion in the quarter ended Aug. 30, beating the average estimate of $52.08 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

Traffic at the warehouse chain, where customers typically buy items in bulk at lower prices, also ticked up in the quarter, after declining about 20% in April, as COVID-19 restrictions eased and it brought back food samples.

Revenue from memberships rose 5.3% to $1.11 billion, while online sales nearly doubled.

Excluding items, Costco earned $3.04 per share, beating estimates of $2.84.",652,0.97

2021-02-05 23:22:01,Payoneer (FTOC): Updated DD," 

I updated the post below to reflect the current valuation and provide a context for evaluating FinTech companies.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The majority of my DD was based on the company’s IR presentation ([link](https://www.payoneer.com/investors/)). IMHO the key for the company is to explain the customer ROI at the unit level and why investments now make sense from a CLTV sense. The company also needs to address flattish margins on 25% revenue growth and negative EBITDA after 15 years of operations. That said, this looks like a great LT hold if they don't get taken out first. The acquisition is expected to close within the first half of 2021.

**Payoneer (FTOC)**

**Summary:** Payoneer is Paypal for B2B global commerce, particularly outside North American and Europe. Payoneer offers investors exposure to mobile and digital commerce, particularly cross-border transactions, at an attractive entry point. What makes the investment compelling is that Payoneer has been around for 15 years, which removes a fair amount of execution risk related to growth, i.e., the team know what they're doing. The company is also investing in providing additional services for its customer base which should contribute to growth and strengthen its competitive position.

**Company:** Payoneer, acquired by FTOC (SPAC), provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises. In 2020, the company recognized $345mn of revenue (31% Y/Y growth adjusted for the pandemic) on $44bn of transactions. The company was founded 15 years ago and operates in over 190 countries (basically the whole world).

**Customers:** Enterprises and SMB. The ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network.

**Industry and market opportunity:** B2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, “scale” and “network effects”. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they’re benefitting from these dynamics. Analysts estimate the global B2B market at over a trillion $ and cross-border payments at $300mn. Obviously, the pandemic only accelerated these trends.

**Management team:** Betsy Cohen led FTOC and has extensive expensive in the FinTech space, including leading previous SPACs and founding Bancorp Bank. Scott Galit has experience at Mastercard and First Data.

**Business model:** Volume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and is expected to grow at 38% in 2021 and 2022, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth for the next two years. The key here is that these growth rates are higher than the overall market so Payoneer appears to be taking share but again more DD is needed.

While the transaction margins have been growing, the company forecasted margins to remain flat at 72% for the next two years. I believe this forecast is due to a change in the blended take rate but unfortunately the company really didn’t elaborate here. I would have expected the revenue growth to drive some incremental margin expansion but I’m clearly missing a piece of the story. This may be an issue for investors. That said, the CFO offered long-terms targets of +20% revenue growth and +20% EBITDA margins. I was also surprised the company wasn't EBITDA positive given how long it's been around but I need to see how much of the costs were investment or subscriber acquisition related.

**Valuation:** FinTech companies such as PayPal, Square, and Payoneer are valued on subscriber growth, which includes subscriber acquisition costs. The key metric which the analysts will judge the company on is customer lifetime value (CLTV), which is an NPV of the total cash flows from each customer over his/her lifetime. (Analysts apply a similar approach to wireless companies and data center REITs where each new subscriber or data center build is viewed on a payback and NPV basis. Investors took a somewhat similar approach to Amazon in its early years if slightly less precise.) Counterintuitively, once the company reaches a certain scale and growth slows, the margins and FCF will improve but the analysts will become concerned that growth is moderating even though the financials are improving. (That's when the smart money will bail.) Again, CLTV is the name of the game and is the primary way to evaluate companies such as Payoneer. There's a reason why the company included different cohort growth rates and mentioned a less than 12-month customer payback in the presentation. These are the metrics that matter.

Based on FTOC's current share price of $13.50, Payoneer is currently trading at roughly $6bn, which assumes 430mn total shares outstanding.\* (This is a SWAG as management did not include a pro forma cap table with shares. I guess $91mn in bankers' fees only buy so much.) This valuation implies an enterprise value (EV) to revenue multiple on 2021 revenue in the mid-teens, which is much closer to global payment processors such as First Data than digital payment and ecommerce companies such as PayPal, Square, and Shopify. FTOC shareholders will own 19.2% at closing. Finally, there is a management earn-out of 30 million shares at the $15 and $17 mark.

* The initial transaction assumed an enterprise value (EV) of $3.3 billion, which equates to 7.6x EV to 2021 revenue. Just to clarify, FTOC was negotiating a CASH investment, i.e., the $750mn raised at IPO and held in trust, not an acquisition with its shares as currency. FTOC's pro forma ownership of 19.2% for a $750mn equity investment roughly equates to the pro forma market cap of $3.8bn mentioned in the presentation. Yes, there is some dilution from the sponsor's shares and the 30m share earn-out but I would argue that FTOC got a fair price for its investment as evidenced by the fact that FTOC shares are trading 30% above NAV.

**Investment Thesis**

**1.** **Majority of traffic stays within the network.** In my opinion, this is the key company metric because it reflects how valuable the network is to its customers. This metric continues to increase for Payoneer.

**2.** **Exposure to digital commerce and mobility trends.** As everyone realizes, this is a big and growing market which the pandemic accelerated.

3. **Global network provides network effects and is difficult to replicate.** The benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer’s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company’s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky.

4. **Playing the long game.** The company’s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It’s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Expect M&A to figure into the company’s strategic plans as well.

**5.** **Attractive valuation:** Payoneer’s valuation is much closer to global payment processors than digital payment and ecommerce companies. The negative EBITDA, flattish transactional margins, and ""adjusted"" revenue are certainly issues and need to be addressed. However, as noted above, Payoneer needs to be viewed in the correct context to value it appropriately. While the company doesn't merit PayPal's multiple given it doesn't have its growth or scale (yet), the company is certainly benefitting from scale/ network effects and deserves a multiple which reflects this. I expect the valuation multiple to rise (or ""expand"" in WS parlance) as the business becomes better understood within the investment community and the company posts a few solid quarters of earnings results. I feel like this is more ""a when rather than if"" issue. Thus, the current valuation represents an attractive entry point for current investors.

**Risks:**

1. **Competition:** Paypal is a giant and only getting stronger as 4Q results testifies. The company has leveraged network scale effects to achieve a market cap rivaling Mastercard. Skrill is also well known in this space. Mastercard and Visa certainly play in cross border transactions but I don’t think they provide the level of services Payoneer does. Definitely need to do more DD here.
2. **Customer risk:** Related to the previous point, if Payoneer loses a large customer like AMZN, the stock will take a hit (cf AMEX walking away from CostCo).
3. **Regulatory:** Payoneer needs to navigate every country’s regulatory environment. The company has certainly done a good job but as the FAANGS can testify, the larger you get, the bigger target you become, e.g., Europe is trying to displace MA and V.
4. **Crypto currency:** At this point, everyone in FinTech better have a crypto currency even its just to allowing transactions in BTC. Crypto currency was made for seamless cross-border currency transactions.
5. **FX exposure:** I’m sure the company has a world class FX hedging team but I feel like this needs to be flagged given the scale of the business. Investors could unintentionally have FX exposure.

**TLDR:** Payoneer is a proven company in a great space with a solid management team that is playing the long-game. IMHO, it is shaping up to be a very attractive investment for LT investors at the current valuation with the caveat that more DD is needed around competition and the financial model. I also would not be surprised if PayPal took them out given their puny $4bn market cap vs. PayPal $300bn. It would be a very nice complement to PayPal's existing business. Regardless, my advice is to load up.

Positions: 1,000 FTOC shares and 10 February /December CC @ 12.50/17.50",2,1.0
2020-11-12 02:26:40,Goldman Sachs has just boosted its S&P Target. Here's why," 

The news that the COVID-19 vaccine from drugmaker Pfizer (PFE) and its partner  BioNTech  (BNTX) is 90% effective, according to  Bernstein Research  strategist  Inigo Fraser Jenkins , has sent stocks scurrying like ""tracks left in a cloud chamber from particles scattering in an accelerator.""

Goldman Sachs strategists, led by  David Kostin , say the vaccine is a more important development for the economy and markets than the prospective policies of a Biden presidency. ""The divisive  U.S.  presidential campaign was actually a backdrop to the main event: a public health crisis that has tragically claimed 240,000 lives in the  U.S.  since it began. However, within less than a year, a vaccine has been discovered,"" they say.

The Goldman team boosted its year-end price target on the S&P 500 to 3700 from 3600, which isn't so far away from Tuesday's closing level of 3545.53. Goldman is also targeting 4300 by the end of 2021 and 4600 by the end of 2022.

The strategists expect the Pfizer vaccine, and possibly others, will receive emergency use authorization by the end of January, and sufficient doses will be available for the  U.S.  population during the first half of 2021. They increased earnings estimates, mostly reflecting the better-than-expected results for the third quarter. They also are expecting better growth in the  U.S.  next year than the market does, at 5.3% versus the consensus forecast of 3.8%. A weakening  U.S.  dollar and slack in the labor market should support S&P 500 sales and margins, they add.

They are not too worried about the weight of the technology giants -- Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and  Google  owner Alphabet (GOOGL). The S&P 500 would rise 9% if the FAAMG stocks trade sideways and the remaining 495 stocks rise by the historical median 12-month rise of 12%. And the S&P 500 would rise 16% if the FAAMG stocks rise 5% and the remaining 495 climb 20%, which would represent an 80th percentile move based on historical distribution since 1990.

As for the debate about value or growth, the Goldman team likes both. For value stocks, the team noted that Monday was the largest single-day increase in the factor's history since 1980, while they say growth stocks should continue to benefit from weak trend economic growth and low interest rates.

""When thinking about the potential resolution of today's record valuation dispersion, investors often recall the unwind of the tech bubble, which was characterized by a two-year bear market and large negative absolute returns of the previous market leaders. More often than not, however, value rallies tend to occur in rising markets during which high valuation stocks also rise but are outpaced by the lowest valuation firms. This 'catch up' dynamic is what we expect will take place in coming months as a vaccine is approved and distributed,"" the strategists say.",38,0.79

All three major indexes finished the day sharply lower. The Nasdaq closed down nearly 5%, and the S&P fell 3.5%, while the Dow finished 2.8%, or 808 points, lower.

So, what happened?

For one, the Nasdaq has been outperforming the other two major stock indexes — the Dow (INDU) and the S&P 500 (SPX) — for months. The rally has been going on for long enough that investors are now taking profit.

Even so, the Nasdaq remains up nearly 28% in 2020, still far outpacing its counterparts. The Dow, which only recently turned positive for the year, is back in the red.

""Although there is no single driver for the weakness, it seems as if investors all of a sudden realized how overbought stocks are and sold. Someone yelled fire in a crowded theater and everyone left at once,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, in emailed comments.

But there are also technical reasons for Thursday's decline: As US-China relations sour, investors are moving money out of tech, which could get hit the hardest from a potential increase in tariffs.

""The Nasdaq is getting hit hard with the continued rotation into cyclicals and expectations big-tech will ultimately pay the cost to a further deterioration with US-Chinese relations,"" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.

Stocks in cyclical sectors are expected to perform better as the economy is recovering.

The Big Tech companies such as Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT), all of which are part of the Nasdaq, have become the safe-haven investment of the summer. But investors have beginning to wonder when the rally will run out of steam, either because of increased regulation or because the economy as a whole picks up enough to void the need for safety picks altogether.

2021-01-12 23:34:47,Buying at the ATH/FOMO," I heard today that more often than not, a stock produces the best gains when people buy at its current all time high. I was wondering what everyone's experience is with this. I don't have FOMO when I buy long-term stocks like AAPL, MSFT, etc. since I'm sure they'll still provide steady gains for years to come. However, I'm more iffy on other stocks that have reached their all time highs, as I worry that it won't produce much more than it has. Take ETSY for example. I planned on buying a share yesterday morning with my $200, since they were at about $183. Then I saw in the pre-market that it shot up to about $206. So I bought a share of Disney instead, since I'm more confident in them in the long-term. My question is, are most people confident in these growth stocks like ETSY to continue shooting up and constantly breaking their ATH? I'm still learning how to do all my proper research on companies and industries, but I don't see them turning into the next GOOG or AMZN or anything. As a result, it makes me feel like I wouldn't see as many gains with this stock. I don't have enough money to buy multiple shares, and I wouldn't want to buy one share of a company and only make about $50 when I could've bought more shares of a cheaper stock for more gains.

“Mohawk has a proprietary software platform called AIMEE that consumes massive amounts of data to analyze trends, consumer sentiment and brand performance. Based on the knowledge, AIMEE helps Mohawk determine which products to produce, market and sell at the right times when consumers are most likely to buy. That keeps inventories from getting unnecessarily high and reduces unsold product.”

Basically, they use their own DATA analytics tool to spot BEST selling products ONLINE. Then develop and sells these products through AMZN. And is also planning to turn itself into a SaaS and open its SOFTWARE to third parties 👀

Hitting some great future trends for me: E-Commerce, Big Data & SaaS.

2020-06-18 12:56:36,Kroger looks like a delicious treat today,"Grab it while the market is complete a NUTCASE. 

Kroger which released earning $1.22/share on revenue that rose 11.5% to $41.55 billion -- beating Analysts estimate $1.14/share on revenue of $40.92 billion. With same-store sales, excluding fuel, jumped 19%.

Guess what? $KR tanked from $32.82 to $31+ now, lost some -5%+! 

Reason? Kroger didn't provide full year comps and earnings guidance due to coronavirus uncertainties (even though they do expect overwhelmingly positive results).

Fact: Kroger today is like Walmart in 2015 (their ecommerce shot up 90%+). After all, what business is better than essential grocery during the pandemic will may last another couple of years or couple of decades. No earning projection? Is this even an issue? Hey, even China couldn't provide GDP estimate for the first time in history.

If you're seeking value like Warren Buffett, this is it.  

**Kroger CEO Talks Earnings, Digital Growth And Food Prices June 18, 2020 1:22pm**

Digital Growth: Kroger reported a 92% increase in digital sales during the quarter as many consumers chose to place orders online for delivery or pickup, McMullen said. To best satisfy the growth, Kroger hired 40,000 new employees to work on the digital side of the business.

 Did you know Kroger is actually doing better than Walmart online! (Not in numbers, but quality = better $$$ margin)

**Kroger vs. Walmart: Who is winning the online grocery war?**

Here are the key takeaways:

* Walmart generates more purchases online because engagement is higher
* Younger & Southern shoppers choose Walmart while retired Midwesterners prefer Kroger
* Kroger shoppers use more branded searches, which is better for brand partnerships
* More shoppers seek household products at Walmart and specific deals and private-label brands at Kroger

Some say it will forever be a grocer (apparently not true... Kroger owns Fred Meyer, and they are huge on the west coast. Fred Meyer has excellent clothing/footwear brands like Columbia Sportswear, Nike, and Adidas. Fred Meyer in my area gives Target and Wal-Mart stiff competition. Kroger also owns Utah's biggest chain Smith's).

Even KR remains as a grocer, which I think they should since that's what they do best, and they seem to know how to do it with nice profit margin, both online and offline (see [https://www.hitwise.com/en/2019/09/12/kroger-vs-walmart-who-is-winning-the-online-grocery-war/](https://www.hitwise.com/en/2019/09/12/kroger-vs-walmart-who-is-winning-the-online-grocery-war/)),

2020-09-10 06:53:09,Read 'The Intelligent Investor' & Sold my Portfolio Afterwards,"I just finished reading '*The Intelligent Investor*' from Benjamin Graham. Afterwards, I tried my best to put Graham's advice into practice and analysed my portfolio thoroughly. As a sidenote, my portfolio was all US stocks (50% NASDAQ-100 and 50% single tech stocks as AMD, NVID, AMZN, ...). I looked at the balance sheets of the respective companies for the first time, with Graham's words in the back of my mind. After 2 days of analysis, I decided that none of my holdings is worth to hold at its current price. Sure, all of them are really good companies with great future prospects, but they are simply way too overpriced.

One sentences from Graham sticked to my mind the most:

**The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.**

That sentence really hit me. It reminded me of the unrealistic optimism among todays ""investors"" that is most embodied in meme sentences like ""sto\*\*s only go up"", ""buy the dip"", and so on and so forth. It really made me realize that this whole game is really just nothing but a game anymore, pure speculation from people relying on the FED to keep their gains growing for another couple of month, before eventually everything has to fall apart.

I think selling my positions was the right move as the market seems to be unsustainable and flooded by optimists these days. I know, timing the market is not Graham's advice either, but he certainly does not recommend a ""never sell anything and always try to buy the dip after a 5% correction"" strategy that most people promote on reddit these days.

It makes up 5.95% of VOO the vanguard SandP 500 ETf and 10.78% of QQQ the Nasdaq 100 ETF. It has many products that make up a big part of the world such as Github, Azure,Dynamics 365,LinkedIn ,Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Xbox and all of their stores that sell computers and laptops. Their Moat is being heavily diversified among many industries that will continue to grow and succeed in the future. Revenue in Q4 2020 was $38.0 billion and increased 13% from Q3 2020. Of that Revenue in Productivity and Business Processes was $11.8 billion and increased 6%. Some highlights in this industry was Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 5% driven by Office 365 Commercial revenue growth of 19%,   Office Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 6% and Office 365 Consumer subscribers increased to 42.7 million,  LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and  Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 13% driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 38% .   Revenue in Intelligent Cloud was $13.4 billion and increased 17%, with the really cool part of Azure revenue growth of 47%. This shows that the cloud or Azure is growing massively as the Industry is still very new and growing rapidly very year. Revenue in More Personal Computing was $12.9 billion and increased 14% with an interesting point of  Xbox content and services revenue increased 65% . The 4th gen Xbox will be released in the later half of 2020 which should include many amounts of Revenue for Microsoft. Microsoft had a total revenue of  $143.0 billion and increased 14% YOY.

Now we shall look at some of the Financials of MSFT. MSFT has $136.527B cash on hand as of Q4 2020. That could buy Starbucks and still have 40 billion USD left over. They have a P/E ratio of 38.76 which can be considered rich but compared with other Tech companies such as AMZN with a P/E ratio of 128.17 and APPl with a P/E ratio of 36.83. This is in line with the coamnpies with a similar market cap.  The Debt to Equity is  0.50. which is very good for a company with MSFT stature. MSFT dividend is $2.04 with a dividend with a yield of 0.92% which is alright for a growth company. The Profit margin is 30.96% which is ridiculous for such a highly valued company. MSFT P/S ratio is 11.55 which alright considering their market cap. The P/B ratio is 13.70 which is high but considering other tech companies such as AAPL with a P/B of 27.5 and AMZN with P/B ratio of 21.86. They have debt but their total assets outweigh their liabilities. MSFT share holder  equity is $118.304B which is very good for them. 

Future Growth and my price target for Microsoft 

 Cloud computing service is a market which is somewhat new but is rapidly expanding. Microsoft Azure is about a third of MSFT revenue but it will grow faster and faster as the  cloud computing service market grows. It is currently worth about $371.4 Billion in 2020 and it is projected in 2025 to be  $832.1 Billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 17.5%.  Also MSFT will continue to supe up the next generation Xbox with new gaming studios and Xbox exclusives. MSFt is also trying to get into the 5G business and it has also created a strategic partnership with Starlink which will give many people faster internet which will MSFT in the long term. MSFT is very stable and increasing on markets that grow very quickly and that will add to its MOAT and it will continue to grow. My price target in 2025  is 445 USD which is about a 100 percent return.",39,0.74

My comments:  
I definitely did not expect the stocks would be this high after just one year. There is a clear divide between the ""new tech"" and the ""efficient tech"" type of companies though: the latter stocks expanded in valuations by a lot. The price to sales on some of them doubled. I'd approach these with caution - the market seems to be a little too exstatic about them, but on the other hand it seems like capital has nowhere else to go so I can't imagine the market abandoning the valuations anytime soon. 

On the other hand the ""new tech"" stocks moved largerly side-ways with two outliers - HXL running into Covid19 trouble as an aerospace supplier and VRTX posting impressive earnings and continuing to execute well on their plan. All in all the valuations of these companies remained sensible in contrast to the ""efficient stocks"". While these should be the higher risk stocks, they seem now like a more reasonable investment.

FB / GOOGL make lots of money and have sufficient cash on balance sheet.

NFLX is heavily in-debted and AMZN has small amount of debt - both make comparably lesser money.

Yet among the 4, NFLX and AMZN are higher yoy vs GOOGL and FB down yoy.

It seems odd - almost like the market doesn't know how to price not profitable companies.

2020-09-30 15:31:55,Monopolies and Peter Lynch on Beating the Market,"Hi all, this is just my personal opinion, let's get straight to the point:

Although most people don't realize it, there are monopolies all around us. I'm going to specifically focus on tech companies as they produce the highest returns (as far as I'm aware) and tech is the industry that I'm most familiar with (from real life), but this should also apply to any industry.

When I'm saying ""monopoly"", I don't refer to the economic definition of"" a company that's actively preventing competition"", but rather to the more lose definition by Investopedia of ""when a company and its product offerings dominate a sector or industry"". Also, we'll be focusing only on the US market and US  companies. General knowledge: ""a market share of greater than 50% has been necessary for courts to find the existence of monopoly power."" According to the US Department of Justice, so we'll go off of that 50% rule.

&#x200B;

Take Google, for example, a monopoly on search engines. According to an article from Visual Capitalist (published on Business Insider), Google and YouTube handle more than 90% of all internet searches (YouTube is owned by Google). Realistically speaking that's a monopoly.

Look at Amazon and the exact same things happen with e-commerce. According to marketer.com, Amazon has a 38.7% US market share. While this is certainly not above 50%, Amazon is still the most dominant player in online retail in the US by a huge margin.

Apple is without argument a ""monopoly"" on the US phone and (potentially) computer market. 

Microsoft is the outlier here because we're looking at it on a global scale but we can see according to statista.com, that it has a 72.9% Global market share of operating systems, thus it has a global monopoly on it.

So my analysis is not perfect, but you also have to remember that each company is well established, with good historical returns (stock wise, and I'm assuming income wise as well), and they all have a multitude of income sources.

&#x200B;

""Alright alright, you've made your point, so now what?"":

So let's assume that I believe that long-term these ""monopolies"" will remain as the dominant players, and because of that and other factors (believing in the company for example), I want to invest in them and only in them (assume GOOG, AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, 25% of the portfolio each).

Often people will say that diversification is an issue with an all tech portfolio, but backtesting for the past 15 years (which isn't that short) shows that tech simply beats the market. That leads me to the second part of the title about Peter Lynch. Lynch has said that ""in order to beat the index, you just take the worst performers out"". Sometimes this will come with more risk, sometimes not. So my question to you is, ignoring the debate about diversification, is there something else that I'm missing?

Here is a screenshot of the backtesting results, assuming you started with $10,000, rebalanced annually, and reinvested dividends. You can even see that the tech portfolio (Portfolio 2) has presumably less risk due to a higher shrape ratio of the SP500 (Portfolio 1): [i.imgur.com/tZl63Ej.png](https://i.imgur.com/tZl63Ej.png)

Thanks for any answers, I'll be happy to take questions as well.

EDIT:
A lot of people say that I've fallen prey to a bias of picking the best performers and then saying in hindsight why they were successful. So we found that the best performers are also tech monopolies (big deal). We also know in hindsight that these companies share (the same) other traits of success (like good revenue), but that's usually a by-product of the monopoly. Now, is it not reasonable to assume that if something is a tech monopoly that it'll play a big part in its success?
If that's a reasonable assumption, then the 4 companies I chose should (for the most part) continue being successful until their status as a monopoly, or something else that's drastic enough (like government intervention) will change. Also, I focus on tech because that's the field I'm most knowledgeable in, which by chance happens to be the be performing sector. I only want to invest in companies I understand.

EDIT 2:
For people saying that ""the returns on these companies aren’t good because they started out as monopolies, they started out small and grew to their position today, thus the high returns."" - Google already had a 56.3% market share in 2007 (digitalsuregeons.com), Amazon I'm pretty sure was always the significant player in US online retail (eBay is auctions not online retail, but still have been passed by Amazon), Apple had the most market share for a single company already in 2014 (Forbes), and Microsoft had a near 100% OS global market share already in 2010 (statista.com) and it even dropped a bit but their stock's performance is still great. Please note that these values fluctuate but it proves that except for apple, most of the backtesting period shows returns from times that these companies were already monopolies.",15,0.68

2020-07-22 11:05:22,Which stock do you see to top market cap rank at 2029?,"Interesting note: 2010-2020 was a time of a huge shift in mindset of investors and landscale of large companies.[For biggest part of 20th century, stock market was dominated by the same names](https://www.researchaffiliates.com/documents/F_2010_April_Fifty_Years_of_RAFI.pdf): AT&T, Exxon, General Motors, IBM, General Electric. For 35 years from 1960 till 1995, these 4 companies rotate each other in TOP-3 list by market cap. 

In 2000s after dot com bubble, new names enters the list. We start seeing Microsoft, Walmart, Pfizer, Merk, big banks like Citigroup of Bank of America, while IBM drops off, but still Exxon and GE keeps their presence.

2010 list was [dominated by high oil prices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization): Exxon, PetroChina, Royal Dutch Shell, Petrobas. 

And in 2010s the dramatic of change was unprecedented. Just **in 10 years, 8 out of 10 top market cap companies drops from the list**. The only 2 who remain are Microsoft & Apple. Now list consists of 7 tech stocks (even 8, if we count Visa as a tech company due to the full IT dependence of its payment system), with only JNJ and BRK as non-tech left.

In the entire market history it was never the case like this. 10 years which changed absolutely everything on the market. 

Hence, the question: *do you think FAAGM will dominate the world in next decade too, or new names (TSLA? NVDA?) are coming to take to royal place soon?*

Personally, in my opinion, current tech area is not properly regulated by anti-monopoly law (especially Facebook, owning information flow of 2bln people, and fully managed by Zuk, who holds majority of shareholders vote), and I will not be surprised to see FB & Google to be divided into different companies like it was century ago with Carnegi & Rockfeller companies. Amazon with P/E close to 150 and extreme low marginality (part of their strategy to kill all competitors, so-called, Amazon effect) eithr should increase marginality soon, or investors might correct the price of the company.

2020-12-31 19:20:43,Let's reflect on our performance in 2020,"*Happy New Year, folks! It's certainly been an interesting one.*

*I thought it would be interesting to look back on how we did for the year and reflect on what went right and what didn't.*

I'll go first. This year, my CAGR ended up around a tidy 30% (Personal RoR, although my TWRoR is similar). 

I'm quite happy with my performance, given my relative inexperience (I've only been in this game for ~4 years, and this was my first year trading options). We'll see how much of it I'll have to give back in the next correction.

**What did I do right?**

Well, my core positions have been pretty consistent. ~15% of my portfolio is in semiconductors, mainly TSM, and the structural advantages, increasing applications, and large moat that this industry has continues to pay off. 

My next largest sector is consumer discretional retail (AMZN, BABA, MELI, RTH, WMT), which saw a huge boost because of the lockdown. I am worried about seeing some pullback next year and shoppers return to their previous habits, but we'll handle that if/when it occurs.

My biggest gains have been from well-timed purchases of smaller cap companies: BJRI, BLMN, M, JWN, DLTR, and AAL were all very kind to me.

ARKK, ICLN, and QCLN have been good ways of getting exposure to areas where I don't have a strong point of view, but see potential for continued gains.

I got into SPACs the last few months of the year. It's a relatively low-information market, and seems somewhat luck-based, but I have made some successful plays there as well.

My decision in August to keep any funds not allocated to an active strategy or thesis in VTI and VTWO instead of in BND or as cash has paid off, due to low interest rates and asset inflation.

**What was just OK?**

My third largest sector is healthcare, which underperformed relative to the eyepopping gains in tech and retail. I'm alright with the opportunity cost there.

I made a small investment into Bitcoin, which I sold at $19k after a 16% gain. I should have held (hedled?) - but I have trouble remaining confident in investments without a strong underlying value investing thesis.

My luck with short-selling has been poor this year. My short positions in GSX and NKLA were pretty successful, but I lost a lot of money shorting FCPT, ACC, BLMN, and BJRI earlier in the year. On the other hand, the excellent performance of BJRI and BLMN meant I later turned them into (ultimately very profitable) long positions, which I likely wouldn't have discovered without the initial short thesis.

There are so many astounding run-ups I knew about rather early on and missed out on: TSLA, MRNA, NIO, PLTR, QS. The hype around these tickers and the sky-high PE ratios scared me off, which might not be a good response in the current market regime. That said, my investing style has to fit my philosophy and psychology to work, so I'll remain disciplined in trying to find opportunities that match my approach.


**What choices were mistakes?**

I tried options this year. I began by paper trading options and lost a lot of (fake money). I then moved on the real-life option plays, and basically broke even. Even so, the stress is *unreal*. I understand how the option greeks and Black-Scholes works, but it still catches me by surprise when the price moves in my favor and my positions lose money anyway. The wide bid/ask spreads and crazy volatility is really hard to deal with, and a single options play starts to take up more space in my head than the rest of my portfolio. As a result, I often end up selling too soon. I don't think directional options plays are for me. I may try selling covered calls in the future.

About 60% of the time I've tried to catch a falling knife this year, I've failed. OTGLY and SWI are two good examples. I'm still not sure how to deal with this.

I suck at scalping - My attempts at day-trading SPXL and SPXS during March and April's high-volatility periods destroyed the subsequent 3 months of returns.

**What did I learn?**

Value investing is still alive and well in 2020 - you just need to understand how to look for opportunities and value growing companies.

I need to respect the tax man: I didn't max out my 401k contribution this year because I wanted to amass some cash in order to eventually put a down payment on a property - I'm going to pay for that in April.

I still don't know where the sweet spot is for leverage. I know options aren't it for me, but I can't help but feel that I could improve my returns by levering up on my high-conviction, low-volatility plays. I'll continue to explore this in 2021.

I firmly believe Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft aren’t going anywhere in the next 5 years but I plan to reassess this decision every year in case anything changes

I also don’t care if tech as an industry crashes tomorrow since my investing horizon is so long.

""Yesterday, the House subcommittee on Antitrust released a 450-page report outlining anticompetitive threats posed by AAPL, AMZN, FB and GOOGL. Our key take-aways from the 45 AAPL pages include: a) dozens of complaints about AAPL (out of the 20mm app developers and 1.8mm apps in AAPL's App Store), with zero positives about AAPL's value to consumers or lifeimproving innovations; b) underscores AAPL's strong shareholder value proposition and finds fault with widely used business practices such as bundling; and c) most complaints about AAPL are biz judgments (they charge too much, they pre-load their apps, etc), and not easily fixable through regulation. Finally, because AAPL's core asset is access to nearly 1B of the wealthiest consumers, we do not expect this report to materially impact valuation.""

""Relating to key issues raised by the House report about AAPL, regulatory experts at Technology Policy Institute (TPI) believe:

1. ""The key regulatory question is whether Apple uses the App Store to systematically foreclose competition or engage in unfair or deceptive practices using quality control as an excuse. This question cannot be answered by claims of a few developers, whose particular apps may have been technically deficient, failed to meet some security standard, or whose apps were unfortunately harmed by legitimate changes in the App Store. ""
2. ""Determining whether Apple behaved anti-competitively when it pre-loads its owned 40 apps will involve considerations such as the difficulty of downloading and installing replacements for AAPL's pre-loaded apps (ie, none), the level of integration of AAPL's owned apps with its operating system, and any negative effects on innovation inside AAPL's app ecosystem.""
3. ""Whether Apple’s app review policies are antitrust violations will hinge on how its policies affect the market and whether prosecutors can prove that the issues raised are not just disputes between large companies over how to distribute profits and protect user privacy/security. Not being able to pay for Netflix and Spotify within an app are not, by definition, harms. To prove harm, a plaintiff would have to demonstrate that their absence foreclosed access, thereby harming consumers.""

2020-07-21 13:37:15,What is with the obsession with taking profits? Why does no one want to buy and hold anymore?,"This is partly a rant as well as a opener for discussion, but I am just confused at many people's obsession to take profits. Like many people who bought in the Covid-19 one-month ""recession"" or even just held good stocks over the years, my portfolio has done modestly well. 

The reason why I ask this question is that people have been telling me to take profits after every surge I have in a stock. Some of these people I know even work on Wall Street. For example, I bought into AMZN in the $1400s in 2018 and I was told to take profits by many people once it went back to $2000/share within half a year. Now you could argue that they were right because the stock did fall back to the 1700s, but we all know that timing the market is near impossible. Had I sold and then refused to get back in because I was waiting for it get ""cheaper"", I would have missed this run up to the 3100s. We can argue whether AMZN is overvalued or not in a different discussion, but I believe in 10 years, AMZN will be much higher than it is now. The number of people clamoring for me to take profits on AMZN is unbelievable. I've literally held this stock for less than 2 years. I bought in during the Covid-19 dip in the 1700s so it's literally been 4 months for some of the shares I've bought.

Fundamentally, buying and holding reduces emotional management and timing. I don't see the issue with owning a company that I believe in as opposed to scrambling to take profits because the number on the screen went up too much. I feel like so many people consider themselves traders over investors and look at the numbers flickering on their screens as opposed to the fundamental value of a company. I would rather put my money in company that I believe in and watch it grow over time than watch if the number went up or down a lot. Personally, buying and holding has been much profitable for me than when I've tried trading and I've done both for a number of years now.",7,0.61
2020-07-09 14:48:37,$WMT - data from Credit Suisse suggests strong initial interest in Walmart+,"According to a survey of 1,000 US consumers by Credit Suisse, 61% of respondents said “yes” or “maybe” to subscribing to Walmart+. This is despite the lack of details on the new service to date. WMT has been expected to roll out its Walmart+ subscription offering this year, which the press (Recode) reminded the market of Tues, sending shares +7% that day.

While most details are still unconfirmed, the subscription service is expected to have various delivery-related perks, discounts, among other features that should provide a competitive alternative to Amazon Prime. With COVID, this seems to be a good time to launch Walmart+.

CS is constructive on the opportunity for Walmart+ mainly because:

1. Subscription provides greater stickiness and the potential for a significantly larger recurring revenue stream and incremental sales/gross profit dollars.
2. A built-in customer base that it can convert. CS estimates an immediate addressable base of 5m, with upside to 10-20mn.
3. Opportunity to capitalize on new customer growth related to COVID; 46% of survey respondents that order groceries online from WMT started after COVID-19.
4. Strong below-45 age group response: 70% of respondents 18-44 interested in WMT+, which is a key demographic moving into peak spend years in many of WMT’s core categories.
5. Survey suggests customers interested in using Walmart+ to buy staples as well as higher margin categories (e.g. apparel, footwear, accessories).

Having said that, respondents believe Amazon still has faster deliver and better online experience. The results also show consumers want free shipping with no threshold, which could be a differentiator for Walmart+. CS estimates that order frequency could grow by 50%+ if the threshold is eliminated, but it would also drive a lower basket size.",10,0.7
2020-09-19 01:46:23,Story of how I tried to beat the market and failed,"I tried to beat the market and made just 2.8% in unrealized gains until now in the year 2020. Here's how that happened.

I invested a total of $65000 in stocks this year. I transferred money into my brokerage account in 16 installments, each time depositing anywhere from 1k to 10k. Instead of readily putting the deposited money into some kind of ETF like QQQ or SPY, I bought individual stocks like MSFT, AAPL, TEAM, BA, C, etc., without any homework at random times. Sometimes, I held cash waiting for the right time to buy something. During the covid-19 crash in march, I caught falling knife on couple of stocks like BA, C, BAC, etc. Due to those losses, I stopped investing for a couple of months exactly when the prices were at minimum of the year.

All of this lead to a significantly low % of returns on my investments. Recently, I calculated how much money I could have made if I immediately invested the deposited money on the same day into QQQ, ARKW, XSD, SPY, etc. and that revealed the bitter truth. QQQ would have given me 18%, ARKW 58%, XSD 14.8% and SPY 4.7%. I know what I did isn't smart. I want to know how can I feel less sad about this. 

Even after this realization, I tried to create my own ETF sort of thing with some proportions across individual stocks. For ex: AAPL 20%, MSFT 15%, AMZN 15%, NVDA 10%, a bunch of growth stocks at 1.5%, etc. When I backtested my ETF purchase across my deposit intervals, I found that I could have made 37.9% in returns. This higher percentage is stopping me from switching to QQQ. Although ARKW returned 58%, I don't want to put all my money in it because they rebalance their holdings every quarter and they hold TSLA and few other risky stocks at large proportions. Even though TSLA is doing very good now, I am concerned about using ARKW and not having stop-loss on TSLA holdings. If I can control my holdings, I can setup stop-loss and protect myself when risky stocks go down. The problem with my ETF is that it's difficult to maintain determined proportions and stop-loss orders. When I want to invest smaller amounts of money, I have to rely on fractional shares and my brokerage doesn't provide that, so I have to shift to Robinhood or other trading platform.

2020-12-14 13:45:27,"Market Roundup for the week ended Dec 13th, 2020","**Here’s the market roundup for last week and the forecast for the week ahead.**

The S&P 500, SPX went sideways, moving up on stimulus and vaccine hopes and lower on higher Covid deaths and lockdowns, [a weak jobs report and rising unemployment claims](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-jobs-report-was-ugly-but-it-may-be-good-news-for-stocks-51607130127?refsec=up-and-down-wall-street). Opening at 3,699, it moved to a new record high of 3,702 but closed the week lower at 3,663 with a small drop of 36 points, [or about 1%.](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/$SPX/interactive-chart)

The Nasdaq composite, $NASX dropped 0.7%, in tandem, but saw more volatility; from 12,464 it moved to a new high of  12,583 on Tuesday before swinging to a big 2% drop on Wednesday, but recovered to 12,379 by Friday, off just 86 points or [0.7% for the week.](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/$NASX/interactive-chart)

# Reasons for the drop:

**Fatigue and profit taking**: For the $NASX, the drop was largely due to profit taking after a 6 day winning streak. The Nasdaq had been making new highs after the elections on an almost daily basis and the drop was not unexpected and If it were not for optimism of the skinny stimulus bill passing in the senate, I would have expected a larger drop.

**Lack of stimulus**: Not to belabor the obvious, Congress gave us another head fake. A skinny stimulus package of about $800Bn presented by a bi-partisan group of Democrats and Republicans seemed to have a strong possibility of passing the senate at the beginning of the week, petered out in the usual finger pointing between the two responsible parties.

**Sentiment Overshoot**: Post election the SPX had moved up almost 9%, in what I believe is a sentiment overshoot. Cash levels with fund managers are extremely low at 4%, a level last seem in 2007 and not seen since the great financial crash.

**Too much optimism** – an overbought market: Too many calls and not enough puts. I follow a fairly reliable contrarian indicator called the put/call open interest ratio.

The Put/Call open interest ratio came back to prominence and gained tremendous significance as an indicator in 2020 with the rise in option trading from the Robin Hood cohort.

The put/call open interest ratio looks at the open interest at the end of the day in the total number of put and call options outstanding for the indices, ETF’s and individual stocks. On a historical basis, the open interest ratio for stocks is usually below 1 – that is, traders usually buy more calls than puts. For example, the put/call ratio for Pfizer is 0.2, i.e., or for every put outstanding at the end of  a trading day, there are 4 calls. That’s normal and understandable; with the vaccine, everyone expects Pfizer to rise and who would short it?

This ratio had been flashing warning signals with readings of 0.37 on Dec 7th, 0.35 on Dec 3rd and 0.4 on [Dec 8th](https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/daily/?mkt=cone&dt=2020-12-08), meaning that there were 2.5 times more calls than puts. When the ratio is around 0.6 to 0.7 it’s around the mean but when it’s so low it works well a contrarian indicator. - As it did around Feb 23rd when the SPX peaked pre Covid at 3,386. That time as well, the ratio was just 0.38.  It again proved reliable during the week of  June 4th when the SPX had regained most of its COVID losses and had reached 3,232, after which it went into the summer swoon because of the explosion of cases in the Midwest and the imposition of lockdowns. On June 9th the SPX dropped 6%. Similarly, we saw another implosion in late August and early Sep, when the equity open interest ratio flashed  4 ratios of 0.37 to 0.42. At that time, the famous Japanese whale was allegedly playing with $50 Bn of options, most of them FAAMG calls! In a matter of 2 weeks in Sep the SPX lost 9.6% and the $NASX 11.8%. 

The total put call ratio is usually above 1, because it includes open interest of not just stocks , but also includes index and ETF options. And it’s not because there are more shorts than longs, it’s because more traders need to hedge their positions and buying an index, or an ETF put is one of the cheapest ways to do so. This too indicated an overbought market with data points of [0.65 to 0.68](https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/daily/?mkt=cone&dt=2020-12-08). The lowest this ratio had reached in 2020 was in the last week of February, around the pre-Covid peak.

# The Week Ahead

**Stimulus and Vaccine priced in**: Yes, the vaccine will help return us to a new normal, but we still have to navigate a holiday season of travel and social interaction which will make an already macabre season of 235,000 daily new cases and almost 3,000 deaths, worse in the next 3 weeks. I believe that the vaccine and the stimulus is priced in and getting to new highs from here is going to be much more difficult.

The IPO euphoria of Airbnb and Doordash shows a very speculative and overbought market.

Barron’s has a great story on why this is looking a lot like 1999, and one should read this article in its entirety to get what a sense of euphoria looked like. [“Maybe this time is different. Those words, supposedly the most dangerous to utter in the investing realm, came to mind amid the frenzied pops in the highly anticipated initial public offerings of the past week.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/from-airbnb-to-tesla-its-starting-to-feel-like-1999-all-over-again-51607700149?refsec=up-and-down-wall-street)”

I believe the market will remain rangebound in the next week, with the key catalyst being the stimulus or lack of. Since this clearly is in the hands of Congress, I would refrain from trading on any assumptions. However, I do believe the damage will be greater if we don’t get a decent stimulus and the upside limited if we do get one.

Having said that, I do agree with [Nomura’s McElligot](https://heisenbergreport.com/2020/12/10/hot-takes-galore-key-macro-thoughts-and-good-stuff-with-nomuras-mcelligott/), who’s been spot on with his market prognostications in 2020. He believes the long term trend is intact and dips should be bought.

As does Marko Kolanovic, Global head of JP Morgan’s Chase, equity strategy division and another brilliant market strategist. [You can read more about his note here.](https://heisenbergreport.com/2020/12/09/marko-kolanovic-delivers-2021-outlook-a-decline-in-volatility-creates-a-positive-feedback-loop/)

I always track the two indices separately. The tech laden, $NASX has already had a blistering run in 2020. The SPX,  which is composed of 500 stocks, with a much wider range of cyclical stocks has naturally lagged behind the $NASX due to COVID, and still faces significant headwinds even with a vaccine being distributed. So often in the past 6 months, traders have dumped FAANGS (FB, AAPL, AMZN,NFLX, GOOGL) in favor of the airlines and the banks in what is known as the cyclical reflation trade .

""Is Google Search Still Top of the E-Commerce Funnel? YES. AlphaWise data show 50%/33% of Americans use Google first when researching items/comparing prices and AMZN Prime members are no different.

""**50% of Americans Use Google First When Researching Products Online**...Our AlphaWise survey showcases how Google remains top of funnel within US e-commerce consumer behavior. Key takeaways include: **1)** More Americans visit Google first when researching products online than Amazon and Walmart combined (50% vs 32%); **2)** One out of every three Americans visit Google first when comparing prices online; **3)** Even when consumers know the exact products they want to purchase, nearly one out of every five will still visit Google first. Notably, this is true even among Prime members as **50%/33% of Prime members will still visit Google first when researching products online/comparing prices.""**

""...**We See this Consumer Searching Behavior and Strong E-Commerce As Tailwinds to GOOGL's Recovery Through ""Shelter-In Holiday""**: We estimate retail/e-commerce makes up 25-30% of total GOOGL search revenue. These consumer searching trends combined with the strong e-commerce consumer and ad markets we expect through the ""shelter-in holiday"" (detailed here) cause us to **raise our ’21/’22 ad revenue by 1%/1%**.""

""We Sanity Check Our Opex with Bottom-Up Business-Level Modeling, with $2bn of Extra Investment for Margin of Safety...Modeling GOOGL’s $55-60bn annual opex base (ex cost of revenue) is difficult given its investment-first focus and the varied margin profile of each business unit. We lean on our bottom-up business-level GOOGL segment model as one guardrail. As shown, we model an implied continued \~$2bn of “other investment” to allow for a margin of safety to our assumptions and/or GOOGL’s likelihood to invest. Looking at it another way, we model company-wide opex (ex cost of revenue) to grow by roughly $9bn/$9bn in ‘21/’22 vs \~$7bn in ’19.""

""...**As Scaling Revenue Drives our '21/'22 EBITDA up 3%/3%; PT Moves to $1,800, Remain OW, \~30% Upside**: Despite this investment, GOOGL’s scaling \~$180bn revenue base drive our ‘21/’22 EBITDA up by 3%/3%. Our PT (based on blend of EV/EBITDA multiple and DCF) rises to $1,800 (\~30% upside). We see upward revisions ahead too, as we are 5%/4% ahead of Street ‘21/’22 EBITDA.""

**""3 Other Reasons We Remain Bullish GOOGL into '21**: Our $1,800 PT implies \~12x ’22 EBITDA (for 20%/15% '21/'22 EBITDA growth) which is in-line vs. GOOGL’s 3-year median (and vs. \~10x '22 EBITDA currently). We don't think this is a stretch and see three other reasons to remain bullish GOOGL into '21.

1. We believe now-quarterly **YouTube** revenue disclosure (and expected \~30% growth in ’21/’22) will help investors better understand its improving branded and direct response ad offerings and growth durability;
2. We see the estimated 12% of GOOGL's ad revenue from travel as a unique way for investors to invest in the **travel recovery**. We currently model travel ad spend to recover in '21 (up \~45%) though note it is still \~40% below '19 levels. The extent to which travel recovers faster could make our estimates conservative and lead to faster GOOGL ad revenue growth;
3. We see continued strong **Google Cloud** reported growth giving investors more confidence in its revenue and earnings potential into ’22 and beyond, which given the $1tn+ public cloud addressable market should drive multiple expansion.""",52,0.86

A similar arrangement between the USPS and AMZN, if renegotiated, could result in between $1B and $1.8B in incremental shipping costs for AMZN, with USPS fees accounting for 40-50% of shipping cost in the US, a 20% increase would result in $1.8 B in incremental shipping costs

Anyone own shop?

I don’t get how this stock trades at 70x sales. It just blew away earnings (100% rev yoy) and is again up huge. Stock has run from 300+ to 1100+ since March. 

But this platform is just a website builder with a shopping cart. Small merchants sign up for a monthly sub fee and use their website template to build their online store.

How is this different from wix or any other website builder? If Wordpress adds a shopping cart, it would compete against shop. An engineer could literally develop a competing platform in a week. 

So where’s the moat? What’s to stop Amzn from offering a similar service for free? FB has already launched a shop feature.

# Description

They've a rather grand vision of themselves

> We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. 

So what does that mean? 

Amazon.com, Inc. offers a range of products and services through its Websites. Both products it purchases for resale and products offered by 3rd parties. It's got 3 divisions:

* North America
* International
* Amazon Web Services (AWS)

So we all know the amazon.com service, but what's AWS? Well as a start-up, Stockflare's built upon AWS. And surprisingly some of Amazon's competitors, like Netflix also store all their mission critical code on AWS servers! AWS allows anyone launch an online service without owning severs themselves. Nice eh? Wait until you see the margin. :)

And when it comes to innovation... well there is AWS okay, then there is the Kindle, and Amazon Prime, and Amazon Local, and Originals,  etc etc...so the Bezos vision... of the ""Everything Store"" is coming together!

## Recent financials 

THe growth is shocking, in a good way. 

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $107bn | $89bn | $74bn | $61bn | $48bn|
|EPS | $1.25 | -$0.52 | $0.59 | -$0.09 | $1.37|

And for 2016 the forecast is sales of $137bn.

When it comes to profit's it's sort of *funny*, as it's AWS that turns a profit, with the North America and International divisions flip in and out of profit. Yes, they are investing, I know. Here's the first 9 months of 2016:

|9M 2016|Sales|Operating Profit| % |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|North America | $53.5bn | $1.5bn | 3% | 
|International | $30.0bn | -$0.8bn | -ve | 
|AWS | $8.7bn | $2.2bn | 25% |

## Competition

The competition section of their annuals rather funny, as they say pretty much everyone is their competitor, though they divide them into 7 groups:

1. all retailers
2. publishers, producers, media distributors of all distribution channels
3. search engines & social networks
4. e-commerce companies
5. fulfilment & logistics 
6. cloud computing IT firms
7. electronic device manufacturers

But to keep our lives simple, let's look at retail-first and digital-first competitors.

At a glance the margin looks good relative to WMT and COST. Though quite a bit behind HD. 

Given the structure of it's business I can't see it ever getting to Google of Netflix's margins, though if we look at the margins of AWS they aren't as good as the digital competitors, though it's not a fair comparison since they are not infrastructure based IT services companies. Though [Rackspace](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/rax/breakdown/latest) has a 32% margin v 25% for AWS.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Amazon.com, Inc. | $127,993M | 9% | 14%
Retail-First | | | 
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. | $484,604M | 7% | 18%
Home Depot Inc | $93,368M | 16% | 116%
Costco Wholesale Corporation | $118,719M | 4% | 21%
Digital-First | | | 
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd | $18,163M | 36% | 15%
Alphabet Inc | $85,537M | 33% | 15%
Netflix, Inc. | $8,176M | 59% | 7%
eBay Inc | $8,906M | 34% | 28%

However, given Bezos' vision and his focus on being always cheaper it's not impossible that they shall always have a slightly lower margin than their competitors. But if the top line's good, well who cares!

## Cash / Debt?

Amazon.com, Inc. has $10,142M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 3% of the market value of Amazon.com, Inc. so if they woke up one day and decided to buy Snapchat from under Zuckerberg's nose it wouldn't be hard to do!

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $922.38 for Amazon.com, Inc. and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 18% to their target.

# Valuation

It's really hard to see the logic behind that $920 price target. It's clearly not PE driven...however, if you look at price to sales, and say that AMZN's current 2.6x forecast sales will rise to the sector average of 3.2x sales, then sure!

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/amzn.o/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
AMZN.O | $370,630M | 164x | 35% | 0% | 3%
Retail-First | |  |  |  | 
WMT | $214,579M | 16x | 1% | 3% | 14%
HD | $158,425M | 20x | 14% | 2% | 8%
COST.O | $66,080M | 25x | 10% | 1% | 7%
Digital-First | |  |  |  | 
BABA.K | $231,090M | 29x | 27% | 0% | 3%
GOOGL.O | $535,531M | 23x | 19% | 0% | 5%
NFLX.O | $50,622M | 295x | 64% | 0% | 9%
EBAY.O | $32,420M | 15x | 8% | 0% | 8%

But frankly, I find it hard to believe that these metrics are really anything more than a place to hang your emotional belief in Bezos.

# Dividends

Amazon.com, Inc. is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. The company hasn't ever paid one. And although they have a 6 year old authorisation to buy back stock, they rarely do it. In effect... it's invest invest invest at Amazon.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 2% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -17%. Wow. Obviously at 160x this years earnings, the EPS figure is irrelevant today. In fact, perhaps the key is the believe in 2017 and beyond. For example the current forecast is for sales to grow 20%+ and earnings to double.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, they were tight lipped about 2017 and it's funny that anytime someone highlighted a potential negative, e.g. lower margins in International, the immediate response is ""we are investing"".

So, I suppose the history of them investing is pretty consistent, and to date their investment has continued to drive topline growth, impressively. They are bigger than HD and COST now in terms of sales. It would be a brave person to bet they won't be larger than Wal-Mart in the next 20 years. Maybe 10 years?

Of course, that won't stop the stock periodically dropping $100-150 a share when the market loses confidence in AMZN, though it appears to typically be temporary *lovers' tiffs*. 

For now, I think I'll await the next tiff.

2020-07-24 03:58:51,Feedback on my strategy,"Hi all, first post here.

I have been self-educating quite a lot over the last year on investing and have decided to finally start investing due to the recent market drop.

To be honest, I probably should have invested back in April, but anyway, I am in the long run for this as I am currently 30 years old and can afford to wait at least five years, perhaps.

So, here is my idea. I have about $10000 to risk on the market. However, I am in debate with myself whether to be conservative or to be more speculative.

Here is my idea for a conservative, almost certain investment (I say almost because I know there is no 100% guaranteed ROI anywhere):

1: Long 20-30 MSFT shares

2: Long 1-2 AMZN shares

3: Long 1-2 TSLA shares(bit speculative, but the first two would probably compensate)

4: Long AMD due to the upcoming next gen consoles. 

Although I realize there may be not much sales immediately, there are products that are maintained for at least few years and eventually the sale numbers will go up. 

Another reason I consider AMD is that it is the prefered CPU for PC streaming and that streaming's popularity has drastically increased especially this year and in the near future. 

Also, this is a covid-safe activity and will probably further increase in popularity so the demand for AMD CPUs should go up. 

As you can see, this portfolio idea involves buying less shares of more sure-thing companies.

On the other hand, I am considering to buy more shares of cheaper, established companies as well as some up and coming ones for speculative purposes.

Here is an idea of what this may look like:

1: Long as many shares of AAL and hope for another quick double like in early June

2: Long Zynga, Pinterest, Snapchat and some other gaming stocks like Blizzard etc.

I would probably go with the conservative approach but would appreciate your feedback too.",0,0.44

So Amazon is up like 40,000% in 15-20 years. It is still growing very strong like it's a startup IPO, thanks to a smart, determined business man in Mr.Bezos.  

Can this company go all the way to $350,000 per share like $BRK.A? We know the P/E is ridiculous but it never ceases to stop this train. 

With a quick calculation, Amazon can go to **$300,000/share** with the following outcome. 

- 10% a year over 56 years
- 15% a year over 38 years 
- 20% a year over 29 years

RUN have grown way too quickly since their merger with VSLR and their financials aren't anything to brag about, so I'd feel safer investing more in CSiQ and ENPH.

I can totally understand them diverging from their core delivery business into other ventures but why in god's name would you make a ton of second rate products that can't compete instead of making one good product. 

Why doesn't Amazon make a movie and music streaming service that can actually compete with Netflix and Spotfiy instead of some half ass wannabe. I literally just canceled my prime service because I realize all these ""Prime benefits"" aren't even being used because I prefer the market leader so much more. Don't even get me started at that retarded phone. ""OMG I can have my phone tell me what it is instead of reading the goddamn label."" How much drugs did the product development team feed the guys at their sales pitch to get that approved? 

WHO the hell needs a giant dildo shaped Siri in their living room? SRSLY Jeff, I'm sick of your shit. ",37,0.6

2020-05-16 19:19:37,"If you had to pick a stock simply based off your personal experiences with the company, what company would you buy?","I've been reading a lot about Peter Lynch's ""Buy what you know"" strategy, where he states how one of the greatest ways to come up with stock picks are to simply think about which companies you or your friends/family love. He argues that this is a way to scout companies with durable moats and shining growth prospects that the street doesn't necessarily recognize as well as regular consumers. 

So, if you were to pick stocks based ONLY on your experiences as a customer, without building any models or reading any research notes, what you’d you pick? My personal choices are Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), Charles Schwab (SCHW), and Amazon (AMZN).",56,0.79

Still I can't help thinking this run up has been pretty damn insane. A part of me really wants to sell, take profits and then buy back into my position, but I could also get screwed big time doing this. ",4,0.67
2020-05-25 11:17:36,Facebook / Shopify: Who wins more from this?,"Hi guys,

I've been reading a lot on this sub for a month or two and was thinking about finally investing and buying some stocks in Facebook. I saw the recent deal they did with Shopify, both stocks are up 10% since the news, but sadly missed out on the instant gains.

I'm really stupid, so I thought Facebook was actually making their own Shops feature, not partnering with Shopify. Shopify seems really overpriced at the moment, so I was going to buy shares in Facebook tomorrow instead. 

In your opinion, who is going to win more long term from this deal? Shopify or Facebook? If succesful, which stock could potentially turn into the new Amazon?

Big thanks to all who reply and to anyone that can help someone new like me.",0,0.43

For example, an ETF that has 20% holding on $GOOGL, $AMZN, $MSFT, $APPL, $FB and they called it BFX, what's stopping another company from creating the same ETF  and calling it BFXX? Besides the ease and simplicity of buying only ETFs, why haven't brokerage companies copying the holdings and reduce the expense ratio and use it for their customers?",4,0.59
