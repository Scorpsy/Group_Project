2021-02-05 04:52:13,Google Stock Analysis | Complete Fundamental DD | Is Google Stock a BUY right now? [GOOG],"In this post we are going to go through an in-depth analysis of Google, we are going to take a look at their fundamental value, their DCF, do a little technical analysis and set some price targets for the near future and for the long term

**\~Very Long Post\~ \[Don't Read Unless You Like DD\]**

Hello everyone! Let’s start by talking a little about [Alphabet](https://ibb.co/NC5sqGv), they are one of the biggest companies in the world that generates most of their revenues and income from online advertising services provided through their platforms like Google Search & YT while also expanding into multiple other businesses like cloud services and autonomous driving technology through their venture Waymo.

The company was founded during the dot com bubble in 1998 and has more than 130K employees, with the company performing quite well in the past year gaining more than 30%.

I believe Google will continue to [grow](https://ibb.co/S6x0XHc) as their cloud platform will remain one of the biggest in the world, while also continuing to innovate and develop other emerging businesses that might turn out successful in the long-term, while their main competition is Baidu & Bing for the search engine, but their market share is still completely dominant, as they also compete with social networks & online retailers for advertising placements.

So, guys, let’s go a little through the 4th quarter & yearly results for Google.

Google smashed [earnings](https://ibb.co/4jSwJVr) expectations for the 4th quarter with a beat of more than $6 on EPS and $4B in total revenues.

The company [reported](https://ibb.co/T24JLqY) a revenue of almost $57B in the 4th quarter while generating revenues of over $182B in 2020, representing a 12% increase over 2019 as they operating income also grew to over $40B for the first time despite a very slow start to the year through the first 2 quarters as their ad revenues were crushed due to the lack of travel & other leisure industries as those are some of the biggest advertiser income streams for them.

The company sustained a significant growth rate in the past year in their 2 major income segments, with their services business which grew by 11%, and the cloud services which also more than doubled their revenues, but the cloud services is still losing money as they keep investing into expanding their services to compete with the other major cloud players like Amazon, Microsoft & Alibaba.

The [company](https://ibb.co/Cmpx7vs) has also started this quarter to report their google cloud results separately to give a more detailed view on how the company is performing, as we can now see how the company has managed to increase their revenues streams and how big the YT Ads revenues have become for them as those increased by 30% in the last year. Meanwhile the revenues from Google Search also rose by 6% and the Cloud Segment spiked by 46%, as they also have a big backlog in this segment.

So [overall](https://ibb.co/r4p6F1Z), the company has managed to increase their revenues in constant currency by 14% in the past year while also improving their operating margin by 2%.

Google has managed to keep growing and improving their business operation through major capital expenditures that have accounted for over $22B in 2020. I believe the big spending on capex is really needed, as the competition in the cloud segment in really heating up, so I like companies that keep reinvesting into themselves, as they have also spent over $27B on R&D in 2020, as they keep investing into most of their products and adding new ones in the pipeline.

Also, for the projections of the DCF it’s important to [NOTE](https://ibb.co/vxtbZcZ) that they had over $13B in Depreciation & Amortization in 2020, with this number growing between 15-30% in the past 2 years so I while use a 15% increase for the DCF to be safe. The other big number that is important is their overall capex spending, which has gone down in the past 3 years, but as things might ramp up again as they mentioned in their earnings call, I will continue to grow this spending by 2.5%/year expecting things to normalize after the company went for a safer approach in 2020.

[Alphabet](https://ibb.co/7GQTZS6) also managed to increase their earnings before interest & tax or EBIT which stood at over $41B while also buying back 1.6% of their total shares in the past year, as they continued buyback [programs](https://ibb.co/c8LKM1g) in the 4th quarter of 2020, buying back over 4.7M shares in just the last 3 months, thus continuing to reward their shareholders even more.

There are a couple of negative outlooks for the company though, as their [effective](https://ibb.co/7vGjYwW) tax rate has increased in the past years, and this might continue to go higher depending on future tax reforms so I will take into account some small raises in the tax rate.

The next problem is the regulatory pressure which can be another bump in the road for Google, but I mostly expect things to drag along and may eventually end with something similar to what happened to Microsoft. Even If they somehow end up breaking their businesses, I think we can see the Cloud business trading at insane P/Es which would increase the actual value of the resulting stocks, while the search engine and YT will remain very powerful even without the contracts with OEMs, which would result in better margins and less operating expenses, as most people would still turn to Google for their searches and videos.

The final problem for Google is the privacy issues, but it seems they have found a way to substitute the traditional cookie technology with a new software interface called Federated Learning of Cohorts.

This technology seems to have at least 95% of the same power of conversion per dollar compared to cookies which would be a huge boost to their privacy issues concerns and will help them maintain their dominance in the online ad’s world.

But this isn’t the only technology Alphabet is trying to develop, they still have other proposals in works as well, which might come in even better, so we will have to wait and see what they go with.

Meanwhile, Google also offered some [guidance](https://ibb.co/NKwgyH2) for 2021 as they expect easy comps in the first half of 2021, while they are planning to ramp up the pace of investments this year.

They also expect to keep investing in cloud segment as their [backlog](https://ibb.co/Ks6TNWq) which stands at $30B is mostly attributable to the cloud segment, as Alphabet will continue to focus on long-term growth that will benefit them in the long run as operating results & margins go.

For the price targets, I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on…

So, let’s start with the discounted free cash flow [PROJECTIONS](https://ibb.co/fpRmHnk) to see what the current valuation of the company is.

I used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later in the long-term projection, and the net income for 2020, to which I added back the Depreciation & Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to an EBITDA of almost $55B

For the next years I used a small increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and also applied a 10% decrease in their net working capital.

I increased the capex spending and their D&A as I previously mentioned, so, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the average SP500 return in the past decades and is what I like to use as a discount rate, given the current low interest rates, we get almost $190B Discounted Free Cash Flows by 2025.

Now there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt of the company, which in this case stand at a net $200B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though most of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach.

If we do use the growth approach, we can see that GOOG is slightly overvalued right now, as this implies a loss of about 5%.

On the other hand, a good EBITDA multiple for the company I think is about 20, as the stock currently trades over this multiple, but for safety reasons, I think 20 is pretty reasonable.

And given this multiple & approach we get a valuation of over $2700, or a 32% undervaluation of the company.

But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for Alphabet in 2021 is $2326, implying a 13.3% return from the last price.

Guys, next let’s move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for Google.

For my [PROJECTIONS](https://ibb.co/W0Lp2W8) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream.

I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the Cloud segment for 2021 as businesses keep needing cloud services more & more, and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth rate.

For the Google Services (which include Search, YT & other revenue streams) I implied a 12% growth, just above last years, as YT keeps booming and the leisure industry advertising will slowly come back. But, for reasonable purposes I also implied a gradual slowdown of this trend by 1% each year.

I believe these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high market share in the search segment and the demand for cloud services platforms.

The 2 other revenues streams which are Other Bets & Hedging I pretty much left unchanged as they don’t really have that big implications on the final number, but I did add a small amount of growth in both of them.

For their cost of sales, I started from the current ones and maintained them for 3 of their segments, while for the Google Cloud cost of sales I implied a gradual improvement of about 14%/year. So, I am implying they reach profitability by 2024 and reach somewhat of an AWS type of profitability by 2025.

Guys, if we add all of these up, it means for 2025 we would get over $334B in revenues and $237B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $97B.

I also [maintained](https://ibb.co/kJxShSy) the same capex as in the DCF while for the interest income & other incomes which stood at almost $7B this year I implied small annual growths, thus leading us to a $75.4B in earnings before tax.

I also slightly [increased](https://ibb.co/rHNCn0d) their 16.3% effective tax rate to about 17.5% by 2025 in order to somewhat account for possible tax changes in the future and also accounted for some share buyback programs of about 1% each year.

So, for the $62B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 653M shares, that would mean a $95.25 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://ibb.co/1vws94Z) is trading at almost 22 times forward price to earnings for 2025.

Guys, for my personal projections I like to use Forward/PE valuations & multiples, so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $2381 and $3810.

After all these estimates what are my price targets?

[HERE](https://ibb.co/JthYJF1) are my actual price targets… I think the 2025 bear case price we can see Google trade at is $2619 which would imply a return of 27.5%, while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that Google will trade at 3095$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 50% return on the current price. 

My most bullish case though, would see the company trading at $3572, which would imply a return of almost 74%. 

So yeah guys, these are my Overall price [TARGETS](https://ibb.co/GFPxV3K) for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 & 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE’s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40.

I think these are pretty reasonable targets, as the cloud services will continue to boom in the next decades, while they will also benefit from an increased reach for their search engine and booming YT platform as more people are getting internet access each day, and we shouldn’t forget that they might have even more great products in the pipeline with interesting names like Waymo.

Alphabet also has very good [financials](https://ibb.co/vL0VccC), with almost $320B in assets vs just $97B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by the current $137B in cash, cash equivalents & marketable securities.

I also like to take a look at what the estimates are from the other analysts, and in this case, we can see an average EPS [estimate](https://ibb.co/NYdX76f) by 2025 of $117, which is way higher than my $95 EPS estimates.

The analysts also expect over $370B in total [revenues](https://ibb.co/m0sMt0t) on average, which is also more than $35B ahead of where my targets are pointing, so, I think it’s safe to say I have been pretty conservative & reasonable with the growth expectations for the company.

You are probably wondering, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for GOOGLE?

Let’s start by taking a look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/RcJL7DK), we can see that Google was trading in an increasingly tighter wedge formation since the September lows. Right now, after smashing the earnings report the company has re-entered overbought territory with an RSI of over 70, which we haven’t seen since the big September sell-off. This breakout from this wedge formation came on the back of massive volumes for the stock, so I believe we can see the overbought conditions push the stock lower in the near-term before eventually going back even higher as I expect with my $2326 prediction for the end of the year.

I also think the $1920 to $1935 range can act as future support after it was a good resistance point for the stock.

But, let’s also take a quick look at what 44 analysts on Wall Street are [saying](https://ibb.co/ZLyzp7h). They are mostly very bullish on the stock with an average price target of $2171 and a high price target of $2610. So, guys, I think the analyst still have some catching up to do with upgrades to the stock after the recent earnings report.

Are you asking yourself, what would I do?

I believe it still has plenty of room to [grow](https://ibb.co/cLGT2BX), so I would start building a position if the stock drops under $2000 and especially buy more if it goes to the previous resistance levels between $1920 and $1935

I also believe that the big % of their shares held by [institutions](https://ibb.co/rw4kX8w), with over 72% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard & Blackrock does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities and increase the support levels power.

So, these are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think Google has a terrific future ahead, with their market [share](https://ibb.co/WGNF2dP) of engine search worldwide crushing the competition and the hole digital ad spending worldwide [forecasted](https://ibb.co/zFdsN0s) to continue to grow and take share of the total ad spending worldwide.

I believe Google will remain one of the best companies in the world while also being a good catch-up play to the other big tech names, as Google has underperformed [compared](https://ibb.co/4FDfJZz) to most of the other big names with the exception of Facebook.

2021-02-25 15:15:57,Why is GOOGL cheaper than GOOG?," 2,031 (GOOG) vs 2,015 (GOOGL)

GOOG is Class C and GOOGL is Class A. Not the other way around. I double checked.

It's been like this for almost a year now for no reason whatsoever that I can find.

GOOGL should be worth more than GOOG because it offers voting rights in addition to the exact equity as GOOG, yet the market is saying the opposite.

PS I posted about this in few non-serious couple months back, and the number one response I got was confusion thinking I mixed them up. No, I did not. I thought by now they would have been equalized, but nop, it's still the same, so I am trying /r/stocks this time.

2021-02-08 04:48:03,Weekly Stock Market News | GOOG / AMZN / PINS / SQ / PYPL / COST & other Stock Market News [02-08],"**The stock market finished a terrific week at record highs. Companies like Google, Pinterest, Amazon & others smash earnings reports while Jeff Bezos bows out. Let’s talk about this & other stock market news**

Hello everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of last week, as we saw all 3 major indexes finish the week with big gains with the SP500 & Nasdaq Composite finishing at new record highs while the Dow Jones did also rise for 5 straight sessions. For the week the [DOW](https://imgur.com/NQpg47q) gained 3.9%, the [SP500](https://imgur.com/cY3wx9N) rose by 4.65% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://imgur.com/T5qgyg5) outperformed gaining just over 6% in what was the best week since early November.

The Volatility [Index](https://imgur.com/Ki1RNHZ) dropped every day last week as it now seats just above 20, with this being a huge level that hasn’t been broken in a long while.

We saw all 11 [SECTORS](https://imgur.com/pp8DYTh) finish the week in the green, with Energy leading the way followed by Consumer Discretionary, Communications & Financials also gaining more than 6%.

[Here](https://imgur.com/tRRK4fZ) is the HEAT MAP from last week, as we saw a hole lot of green in pretty much every sector, with big tech names gaining huge while the biggest lagging sector was Health Care. The big tech names just continue to [increase](https://imgur.com/96Q4J9w) their % of the SP market cap as technology is likely to continue to be one of the best performers in the next decades.

We also saw some interest economic data last week, as manufacturing continue to recover in January as both the [ISM](https://imgur.com/Q9ZPnxF) index and the [PMI](https://imgur.com/nVz0oDe) Index came in pretty solid and continued to stand in expansion territory.

Also, the [ISM](https://imgur.com/jgJ2IbI) Services Index came in better-than-expected rising above expectations due to an increase in employment & new orders.

In terms of Job numbers, we saw [ADP](https://imgur.com/a39dqcB) coming in way better than expected as over 170K jobs were added after a big drop in December. We also saw initial jobless [claims](https://imgur.com/ftMXubP) dropping even more than expected while the continuing jobless claims fell to under 4.6M last week.

This [WEEK](https://imgur.com/vLr3QHG) is pretty quiet in term of economic data, with core CPI, Consumer indexes and jobless numbers being the biggest ones while the [EARNINGS](https://imgur.com/PMP5olx) season continues with some of the most interesting earnings coming from Twitter, Coca-Cola, GM, Uber & PepsiCo while we also have to see how Disney subscriber numbers are continuing to evolve after hugely upgrading their expectations. One other thing that I am also interested to watch is the PayPal investors day on Thursday in which they are expected to provide a 3-to-5-year financial outlook.

In some other stock market [news](https://imgur.com/EcqHtMU), it seems that most of the RBNHD retail investors that have jumped ship are going to Square’s Cash APP with almost 40% of investors choosing the app. We have to see if this trend continues now, after [RBNHD](https://imgur.com/joQIln0) removed limits on all stocks, but regardless, I think Square is a nice FinTech play despite their huge valuation right now, as they will also benefit from the jump in digital currencies and more companies planning to increase investments in integrated POS providers just like Square.

We also had a lot of interesting earnings last week with Amazon [crushing](https://imgur.com/GILwN3r) expectations, beating by almost $7 and almost $6B on revenues as this was the first time Amazon passed the $100B mark in a quarter as the holiday & e-commerce demand combined to give Amazon a 44% increase y/y in sales. The other big [thing](https://imgur.com/WMmAddL) we got from Amazon was that Bezos will step down as CEO as Andy Jassy the current AWS leader will become the next CEO. This news caused some uncertainty for the company, but I believe this is still a long-term buying opportunity as Amazon will remain one of the best companies to own in the world.

Also, one of the biggest fintech companies out there, [PayPal](https://imgur.com/Klv5tD6) showed great strength in their numbers, beating both the top & bottom line as their total payment volume and new active accounts showed continued strength in the move to more & more online payments solutions.

The other big earnings report we saw last week was from [Alphabet](https://imgur.com/5BOUPT0), which also beat by more than $6 and $4B in revenues as they surprised most of the analysts with great beats in most of the segments as their operating margin came in 5% better than expected. The biggest income generator remained the Search & YouTube business as they are still investing huge in their Cloud platform that is still bleeding money, but is very likely to pay out in the long-run.

Other companies also smashed earnings with [Pinterest](https://imgur.com/0zB9SPh) beating expectations after a 76% revenue growth and a 37% user growth while [Ford](https://imgur.com/zerclC2), which was expected to post a loss, turned out positive earnings of $0.43 despite a 9% decrease y/y in total revenues, as the last 2 quarters of the year provided strong evidence that Ford is progressing into turning around the company.

Meanwhile, though they didn’t have an earnings report, [COSTCO](https://imgur.com/6UmGJ7x) reported a rise in sales of almost 18% in January as the total comparable same store sales which rose by 15.9% crushed the analyst expectations of just 11.7%. I believe Costco is one of the best retailers to own despite it trading always at a premium, as the company is also jumping on the e-commerce trend, with a 107% increase in e-commerce sales in January.

And finally, let’s hope for a good day as the [world](https://imgur.com/itl9KxB) stock markets and the US [Futures](https://imgur.com/mlrfLz5) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way after the Treasury Secretary [pushed](https://imgur.com/jfKvaev) for more fiscal aid to help the economy & the unemployment fully recover as fast as possible.

2021-02-14 17:44:42,GOOGL trading at a discount to GOOG,"As of market close, February 12th, GOOGL traded at $2095.03, and GOOG traded at $2104.11. This means that the voting share class traded at a discount of $9.08, or 0.43%, compared to the non-voting share class.

This isn't just a one-time fluke either. The voting premium turned into a voting discount on August 13th, 2020, and since then GOOGL has traded at a discount compared to GOOG for 126 out of 127 trading days.

At market close on April 28th, 2015, just after the most recent stock split, the voting premium was $10.69, or 1.9%. The voting premium has been as high as $29.80 (or 3.73%) in 2016, but has been steadily declining for a while.

What can explain the voting discount? As far as I can tell, class A and class C have the same economic interest rights, with the voting rights being the only distinction between the share classes. Even if you don't value the voting rights at all (which is a reasonable perspective, given the decisive insider control), surely the voting rights shouldn't have a _negative_ value?

It seems Alphabet is buying back their class C shares, but not their class A shares. Is this a sufficient explanation for the price difference? I would expect that hedge funds would see this as an arbitrage opportunity, and would balance out the supply/demand for class A / class C if the price of class A dips below that of class C.",11,0.71

If Apple was to introduce their own search engine, this practice would obviously cease. For almost anyone else, it would be laughable to try and compete with Google’s search engine, but we are talking about a company with more cash than any other, ever. They could afford it and if they were successful, the ad revenue would become a significant part of their business. The linked article shows ample evidence that Apple is moving towards launching a search engine offering. Has this been factored into Apple and Google’s stock price? Given Apple recently hit $125 a share and is now at $115 ($116 after hours), it could represent a very good entry point to take advantage of this being introduced in 2021.

In these episodes, the host discusses several flavors of advertising, including newspaper, TV and digital ads, the latter which has the largest implications for some of our highest performing companies over the past year. It's clear that this question is hard to answer - there is so much market inertia and business pressures hindering a thorough exploration of the topic, but nonetheless Stephen Dubner is able to present the case of eBay that showed that paid-search advertising has practically no impact on sales. 
Of course digital advertising is important for less mainstream companies who are trying to establish their brand, and micro-targeting consumers is very effective, but that accounts for a fraction of what is spent on these ads globally. Why are giants like Pepsi, Coca-Cola and Kroger still spending so much on ads for products that we all know, and how many hundreds of billions of dollars can they save if they were to conduct their own investigation only to find that these ads have almost no impact on sales? And how would the fallout from these studies affect the digital ad business, which is dominated by $GOOG, $FB, $AMZN in the U.S.?

2020-08-12 11:17:21,GOOG vs AAPL? Which do you prefer longterm?,"Been thinking of whether I should trim my apple or google positions and honestly...feeling kinda bearish on Google.

Google has been lagging QQQ for a while now. I guess partly due to the ad cutting due to corona. But it also seems like their ad revenue growth has been decelerating for other reasons with a lot of players attacking the space from different angles (Amzn,TTD, Roku, FB, ramp etc).

 Their company culture is heavily based around engineering yet not so savvy when it comes to product marketing and expanding shareholder value. They come up with cool tech but seem to always be either too late or too early to the party. Google glasses didn't pan out, pixel phones are a modest success but not taking the industry by storm, google shopping is a money sink, Google fiber was curtailed, Fitbit acquisition is kind of iffy (Samsung/Garmin/Apple already dominate the space across respective demographics). They keep selling the AI future but Waymo seems to be the only thing they have going here that can turn out to be truly profitable. Will that be enough though?

Apple on the other hand knows how to drive share price. Always doing buybacks. Although they are historically a hardware focused company they are transitioning more and more into the services industry with their popular app store, Apple TV+, apple pay etc. Seems like this will be their long-term pivot. And road ahead seems more clearer to me than Google's. 


Seems like AAPL just has more growth opportunities left in it and has superior company culture. Google seems to be transitioning to more of a value stock. What are your thoughts?",26,0.93

2020-08-12 10:13:18,Hints At Android Automotive OS's Imminent Breakout (GOOG) / DD,"**From the article:**

>Volvo Cars, Renault, General Motors and more have announced plans for infotainment systems powered by Android Automotive OS with Google apps and services built-in.

[https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/08/android-for-cars.html](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/08/android-for-cars.html) 

I'm a developer and I follow Android auto development somewhat closely, and this has led me to believe that Google / Alphabet is going to be getting into fleet management with Android Automotive OS. This is going to continue to grow with consumers, but also commercial vehicle fleets in a huge way. This is so much more than a modern radio ui for cars.

Paying for EV charging, monetized in-car apps, paying for tolls, driver monitoring, fleet route management and logistics, fleet fuel payments, rental car management, corporate car management, last-mile delivery management - Google is going to own this space in a few years. Android Auto was a huge exercise in in-car UI. This is a next step towards Alphabet running the infrastructure of fleet logistics, skimming a little bit off every transaction that runs through cars. Monetizing the prominence of certain EV charging stations over others during route calculations. Making fuel / charging payment as seamless as a Tesla connecting to a supercharger for everyone else. 

This complete vehicle systems integration with the OS is a step away from integration with Waymo autonomous technology in the future. Think of the data collection potential, and similar shadow training capabilities that associate camera feeds with driver interactions.

This developer article is a key baby step indicator revealing that Renault and GM are not far away from integrating this technology. We know GM / Renault both have huge vehicle fleets in the corporate world, and that this is no longer a niche play with companies like Volvo.

AAPL has still long way to go in terms of selling phones and other stuff. They are like windows of mobile phones. They are even replacing windows in laptops. They own mobile domain.

GOOG has lot of ad revenues. I am not too sure about all the other stuff they do.

I am not sure about MSFT story. It is growing into cloud space. They missed big time in mobile space like Intel. They have strong office suit and windows. I think, they have big windows stack/servers for enterprise applications.

I am also thinking about COSTCO. It has nice concept of selling limited skus in big quantities. It has its own private label which can be as big as P&G.

2021-02-20 21:31:38,What are your long term plays for the rise of AI,"AI is poised to keep growing, with GPUs and other hardware used in AI becoming stronger, and with the eventual arrival of Quantum computers, we should see a great boom in AI in the next decade. What are your investment plans to profit out of this industry?

I see a few different ways to capitalize on this:

Investing in companies that provide hardware for AI: Here I'm most referring to AMD and NVIDIA, their GPUs have become very useful for training AI models and are heavily used all across the industry. They are also not just dependent on AI but gaming as well since their GPUs are used for that as well. [This](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/White_Papers/ARK%E2%80%93Invest_BigIdeas_2021.pdf?hsCtaTracking=4e1a031b-7ed7-4fb2-929c-072267eda5fc%7Cee55057a-bc7b-441e-8b96-452ec1efe34c) should be a good read. Cathie woods is expecting a huge rise in the deep learning / AI Chips market which should definitely benefit these industries. Even at AMD/Nvidia's current levels I think they have room to grow.

Investing in core AI applications company: I'm taking about companies like [C3.AI](https://C3.AI), PLTR (I am very bulling on PLTR) and other companies that provide AI/data analysis based solutions. These have heavy exposure to just AI and are sort of high risk high reward plays, even in the long term.

Investing in big corps that have exposure to AI: Good old MSFT, GOOG and other similar companies. This should keep your money comparatively safer while also giving you think opportunity to capitalize on AI boom.

What are your plays? Your plans, specific companies you are interested in?

Disclosure: I have long positions in PLTR and MSFT.",64,0.92
2021-03-09 15:20:42,Analysis - $LUMN - Lumen Technologies,"# $LUMN - Lumen Technologies (Formerly CenturyLink)

Second time posting DD ($ON was my first [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lh6ppx/on_on_semiconductor_analysis/))- please do provide constructive feedback on what other areas you would have looked into / found useful and overall formatting. Additionally, if you have arrived at different conclusions / can poke holes in the theory I look forward to reading rebuttals in the comments. There was a lot more research that went into this one as some of the kind commenters identified gaps in my research methodology last time so I have tried to make up for it here.

All currency in USD and Millions unless otherwise specified.

### TL; DR

Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink) is a telecommunications company which provides products and services related Network, Cloud, Security, Voice, and Managed Services to enterprise, SME, and retail customers.
Lumen is aiming to position itself as a key infrastructure partner underpinning public and private cloud, edge computing and fiber connectivity. LUMN is building its services with 4 key areas in mind:

1. Physical assets and infrastructure – These include fiber, hardware and facilities.

2. Software managed networking – This is a network-as-a-service (NaaS) offering that can be leveraged to connect organisations with

3. Hybrid Cloud – These include private cloud and datacentres, colocation services and connections with public cloud service provider partners.

4. Lumen Orchestrator – This is the orchestration solution that allows for the management and control of the various services that are offered.

I am currently bearish about LUMN with no immediate plans to invest (although in the event of the price dropping into the single digits, I would re-evaluate this position). There are a few key reasons for this, but I encourage you to read the full bullish, bearish, and neutral considerations in the rest of the post:

1. LUMN earns a significant portion of its revenues from legacy offerings e.g., traditional telephony. This revenue stream has been decreasing YoY for the last few years and this is likely to continue. 

2. Despite the above, there are significant areas of potential for LUMN – specifically in their Edge Computing and software defined networking offerings (see Organisational Summary below). Edge Computing is only a small % of current revenues and while it is likely to grow, it will take time to significantly grow these streams. I view the Edge Computing growth as a slow burner and small market, but this will grow at a rapid rate in the future.

3. LUMN has a high level of debt, and while they have managed to de-lever and reduce interest rates, the amount of debt is still significant. When accounting for intangibles and goodwill, the level of liabilities is roughly 1.6x the value of assets (although specifically looking at long term debt this is a healthier picture at 70% of non-current assets).

4. Revenues have been consecutively down for the last few years and are unlikely to show a significant turnaround next year. This is somewhat mitigated by improvements in margin which are expected to continue and a healthy level of free cash flow at $2,770 although this has been declining YoY. 


Please do have a read of the Bull, Bear and Neutral points in the detailed post below for a more balanced and in-depth view.

### Key Data

All data believed to be accurate as of 05/03/2021

- Price = $13.45
- P/E = -12x
- EPS = -2.12 (dil)
- Forward P/E = 8.5x


# Detailed Analysis

### Bull Considerations

- $LUMN are well positioned to become significant players in high potential markets – specifically fiber and underlying network infrastructure, NaaS and Edge computing.

- $LUMN has several verticals it can offer to customers including Hybrid Cloud, Connected Security and Collaboration. These can be leveraged to grow revenue streams in parallel (i.e., cross selling products and services to customers).

- Successfully managed to de-lever the company from previous debts. While this is a great deleveraging trend and a significant reduction in interest rates by redeeming outstanding 5.375% and 7.00% notes^(1) and replacing them with 4% bonds, the level of debt is still a concern (see bearish consideration item 1).

- The dividend from $LUMN has been consistent and relatively attractive (although on a yield basis this is less so if the price continues to rise). The board are committed to continuing the dividend payment and at the present time it can be safely assumed that $0.25 will be paid per share per quarter for the remainder of FY21. Dividend yield should not be the primary reason for going into $LUMN as yield is ~ 7% (at a stock price of $13.70). In the event of a dip to single digits, the dividend becomes extremely attractive and is worth considering (at a yield of > 9%).

- Despite the overall reduction in EBITDA (see bearish item 4), EBITDA margin has improved and is likely to continue improving into FY21 due to cost cutting measures being pushed by executive leadership.

- Significant number of insider purchases throughout 2020 with one sale.


### Bear Considerations

- Overall, there are likely to be better candidates for returns on investments than LUMN, while LUMN is in a number of attractive areas, it is still growing revenues and these are unlikely to materialise in any significant manner over the next year or two. See competitive advantage section for additional details.

- $LUMN holds significant long-term debt of $31,837 (down from $34,694 in 2019). This debt is primarily due to $LUMN’s all in play to fiber (at the expense of 5g) when they purchased Level 3 Communications for $34,000. It is worth noting that $LUMN has not had an issue with either paying down debt and paying dividends with its current cash flow.

- $LUMN earns a substantial portion of revenues from legacy services. These include voice ($391 in 4Q20) which approximates to 29% of overall revenue. As can probably be guessed, this has regularly declined over the course of FY20. While not all the voice revenue is likely to be a “legacy” product, I am considering it as such as there are likely to be other legacy revenue streams. (N.B. According to $LUMN legacy revenues primarily include voice, private line (including special access), switched access and other ancillary services.)

- $LUMN is facing lengthening sales cycles for its products and services as their customers (and more likely organisations in general) continue to evaluate new infrastructure needs and delay purchasing unless necessary. This is likely to continue until at least 2022 as cost pressure at organisations globally push down purchases.

- Revenues are down both QoQ and YoY with EBITDA down YoY and there is no expectation that they will increase next year with best estimates at stable revenue / EBITDA and worst-case a reduction. YoY revenues have decreased for both FY20, FY19 and FY18, although the rate of decrease has reduced over time.

- Free cash flow while still high is reducing over time and will continue to do so as LUMN are likely to continue to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and paying off its long-term debt.

- Executive compensation (specifically focussing on CEO compensation) is above average for the industry at $17M (compared to an average of $10M for similar sizes). It is worth noting that when comparing against larger companies or those listed as competitors, this level of compensation was not unusual. Compensation did stabilise as performance dropped, however, no decrease in compensation occurred despite the decrease in earnings. While not initially a problem, if the results do not turn around, and there is no decrease in compensation, there is a concern that executive pay is no longer in line with the company’s results.


### Neutral Considerations

- Long term credit rating (Moody’s) – Ba3: Speculative with substantial - high credit risk.

- Speculative Grade Liquidity Ratings – SGL-2: Good liquidity, will be able to meet their obligations over the next 12 months through mostly internal resources but may rely on external sources of committed financing.

- Southeastern Asset Management has increased its position in $LUMN as of Dec 2020. It is worth noting that they have lost (~25%) on the investment to date^(2). Despite this, they remain bullish on the overall prospects as the CEO has tightened controls on costs and margin improves. Additionally, they believe $LUMN can monetise several segments they are in (specifically fiber), and that as a multiple of free cash flow (< 5 at the time of investing) is an attractive valuation. As a final point, they have signed an NDA with $LUMN, and this indicates a higher and more “activist” level of engagement^(3). I have listed this as neutral despite the bullish sentiment of SAM, as their track record for the last year has not been great compared to the overall market.

- $LUMN will be seeing reduced subsidy revenue (from CAF II – A US initiative to improve connectivity) with subsidies declining to $20 by 2022. However, $LUMN believes their investment into providing this connectivity is likely to add to revenue that will make up for the loss in subsidy.


### Organisation Summary

Essentially Lumen Combine underlying infrastructure with platforms (i.e., cloud PaaS) and Applications (SaaS):

1. Adaptive Networking – High performance network connectivity i.e., on premise private lines, Content Delivery Network, fiber internet connectivity, direct cloud connections (where they provide corporate WAN infrastructure a direct link to Cloud) and managed networking services / consulting.
  - Content delivery network market growth is forecast to grow at 14% till 2025^(4).
  - Fiber Internet connectivity in the US grew at 12% from 2019-202022 and will likely continue to grow at a similar rate for the next few years. Across the EU growth rates are largely similar for both coverage growth and subscriber growth^(5).
  - Software defined networking offerings (Networking as a service) is an expanding industry and likely to see significant growth of 34% annually till 2026^(6).
  - Growth rates and industry sizes for private lines and direct cloud connections are not easily available. I believe direct cloud connections are a growth area and likely to grow at a reasonable 10-15% annually for the next few years (based on over all cloud growth, increase in colocation and deployment of data centres – see Hybrid Cloud below).

2. Collaboration - VOIP, teleconferencing, collaboration solutions (e.g., file sharing and virtual meeting rooms all hosted by Lumen, but the products can be from vendors like Zoom, Webex Skype etc.), contact centres and calling services (e.g., traditional phone style calling both locally and internationally as well as toll free / business numbers. Also advanced emergency services support).
  - VOIP is relatively mature industry with a CAGR of 12% (at best) till 2025^(7). Personally, I think we can discount any mobile VOIP growth as I do not believe LUMN has offerings in this space and in my view, this would lower the effective CAGR with 8-10% looking a more reasonable target.
  - Call centre growth is forecast to grow at 6% till 2027^(8). The US houses over 60% of call centres globally, and this number is only going to decrease as increased internet penetration and decreased telecom rates drive the outsourcing of call centres^(9).
  - Numbers and growth rates to traditional telephony are limited but I imagine that growth is probably negative. For toll free, business numbers and emergency services support, growth is likely positive but limited.
  - Collaboration solutions are growing at a reasonably high rate of 13% till 2027^(10). However, LUMN is limited to managing, implementing, running, and hosting products from other vendors as they do not sell their own.

3. Connected Security – Threat management (managed threat intelligence), managed SOC services, WAF and DDoS mitigation, managed firewalls, and professional services.
  - The WAF market is expected to grow at 18% annually till 2022^(11).
  - The DDoS mitigation market is set to grow at 15% annually till 2026^(12).
  - The managed security services are expected to grow at a CAGR of 8% till 2025^(13). While I think managed firewall growth is likely to be less than other managed security services (e.g., IAM, SOC etc), a growth rate of 4-6% is probable.

4. Edge Computing – Managed services, connections to both public cloud and private data centres, networking, colocation, cloud. Essentially connecting edge locations / end user servers to backbone infrastructure. 
  - Edge computing as an industry is forecast to grow at ~25% annually till 2025^(14). However, it is currently a small market valued at ~ $ 2,000 in 20201. Edge computing as a market can be further subdivided into hardware, platform, and services. Hardware is expected to grow at the fastest rate of the three potentially reaching 40%^(15).

5. Hybrid Cloud – Cloud storage, disaster recovery (data replication and business continuity), hosting services, data centres, private and public cloud alongside consulting for cloud.
  - The private cloud market is expected to grow at 29% annually till 2025. Private cloud growth will primarily be driven by businesses who wish to take advantage of public cloud capability with the addition of potentially more secure and customisable hosting resources. On-premises cloud growth will be significantly lower than provider hosted options (PaaS / IaaS) which are likely to hit 50%^(16).
  - Hosting services are likely to increase in market size by 15% annually^(17).
  - Deployment of data centres are likely to increase slowly over the next few years with a growth rate not likely to exceed 10% (estimated at 6% for 2021^(18)). Similarly, colocation services are likely to see a modest 14% CAGR^(19).
  - Global cloud storage is expected to increase at a rate of 20% till 2025^(20).

### Competitive Advantage

1. Adaptive Networking:
 - Summary: A large revenue earner with solid growth potential. $LUMN is a large player in the infrastructure space and should be able to leverage that to provide organisations with NaaS and global fiber connectivity.
 - From a coverage perspective (compared to Verizon and AT&T as of 2019), $LUMN serves 16% of the population, with Verizon and AT&T serving 17% and 41% respectively. It is worth noting that $LUMN covers more states than either^(21, 22). N.B. this view is for consumers but presumably also can also be applied to corporate coverage.
 - $LUMN is relatively well positioned from a fiber perspective as they have a lot of “unique coverage” (i.e., locations served without significant competition) in the US and have coverage in Europe and Asia. They carry a large portion of internet traffic on their network backbone and have 180,000 locations globally which provide their customers direct access to $LUMN infrastructure. Additionally, they have direct connectivity to several cloud service providers and data centres. Compared to competitors, they appear to have the largest total fiber route^(23).
 - The software defined networking offerings are an exciting growth opportunity and combined with the strong infrastructure position of $LUMN will mean that customers (particularly those that are multinationals and large enterprises) can utilise the network as a service offering to connect their enterprise infrastructure efficiently and effectively across the globe including connections from on-premises to cloud service providers.
 - While competitors do exist, from both a software defined networking perspective (e.g., Fortinet, Cato etc.) and an infrastructure perspective (e.g. Verizon, AT&T etc.) $LUMN has the advantage of being a strong player in both areas with good partnerships with Cisco and VMWare.

2. Collaboration:
 - Summary: Largely a legacy business and revenue generator for $LUMN. This will be a shrinking revenue area for $LUMN as the decline in traditional legacy telephony services is unlikely to be made up for by any growth in VoIP or collaboration solutions. Additionally, this area is a large revenue earner for $LUMN, and significant declines here would result in material impact to value.
 - While implementing and managing VoIP, teleconferencing and collaboration solutions with partnered vendors (e.g., Zoom) are likely to show some little to moderate growth over the coming years, they will likely provide consistent revenue due to the underlying network requirements needed to effectively utilise such solutions.
 - Traditional telephony services including contact / service centres and business telephony service revenues are likely to shrink over the coming few years.

3. Connected Security:
 - Summary: The cybersecurity market is an exciting growth area which holds significant potential for $LUMN. However, it remains a small % of overall revenues and so revenue growth in-line with industry expectation will not materially impact the overall value of $LUMN.
 - If $LUMN can leverage their verticals in the datacentre / cloud space to cross sell their security services this could see some reasonably large growth, but overall due to the small footprint of $LUMN in the cloud space presently, material value growth due to this vertical is likely be several years out.
 - Additionally, $LUMN is not a recognised global player in this industry unlike Akamai or NetScout, and so will be at a disadvantage compared to incumbents with higher profile portfolios.

4. Edge Computing:
 - Summary: This could be a strong growth area for $LUMN. Could be a way to take advantage of the potentially significant growth area of Edge computing. However, it is likely to significantly materialise only 1-2 years out with little revenue growth in this area prior to then as organisations slowly accept this paradigm shift. Additionally, it will be a highly competitive area that will require significant investment to grow and maintain an advantage.
 - As of 23 Feb 2021, $LUMN claims they provide 60% of enterprise locations with <5ms latency to edge nodes. Their goal is 90% by the end of the year and their large fiber network leaves them at an advantage compared to competitors. (See Adaptive Networking).
 - An example from the 4Q20 earnings call was SAP using their Edge infrastructure to bring SaaS applications closer to customers and bypassing unnecessary internet traversal.
 - While $LUMN can leverage its underlying infrastructure and assets to push a solid offering, this is likely to be a highly competitive space with players including typical cloud service providers e.g. Microsoft, Amazon, Google and HPE as well as specialised players e.g. Mutable. Large cloud players will have both the hardware and software required to compete effectively with $LUMN while also being able to leverage their substantial public cloud technologies to gain an advantage.

5. Hybrid Cloud: 
 - Summary: If you are interested in taking advantage of private or public cloud growth then Lumen probably is not the best value even at its current multiple. This is due to low revenues (as a % of total revenues) from Cloud related activities. Additionally, this space is highly competitive and $LUMN does not appear to have the background or experience (it is working on growing its employee expertise) although they can potentially take advantage of their underlying infrastructure from their fiber and physical assets.
 - Personally, I believe Private Cloud is not a significantly growing area with potentially some shorter term increase due to pandemic pushing a more remote working / access focus. However, longer term 3-5 years out, I think hybrid cloud will be the dominant focus as organisations transition from private cloud to increased public cloud usage. Only 3% of enterprises use private cloud exclusively^(24).
 - If you are going to opt for growth within public cloud, there are higher growth options with AMZN, GOOG and MSFT although these are substantially higher in price. Alternatively, Cisco, HPE, or other smaller providers may work. A dedicated cloud provider will likely provide better value than $LUMN due to the low revenue share (see above).

**Introduction**

“[FuboTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FuboTV) ($FUBO) is an American streaming television service that focuses primarily on channels that distribute live sports, including NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, MLS and international soccer, plus news, network television series and movies.

Launched on January 1, 2015 as a soccer streaming service, FuboTV changed to an all-sports service in 2017 and then to a virtual multichannel video programming distributor (vMVPD) model. As a vMVPD, FuboTV still calls itself sports-first but its expanded channel lineup targets cord cutters, offering a selection of major cable channels and OTT-originated features that can be streamed through smart TVs, mobile and tablets and the web. The service is available in the United States, Canada and Spain as of 2018.""

From their [home](https://www.fubo.tv/welcome) page:

They are the only competitors in their space of digital sports broadcasting, offer 4K streaming and upscaling of live sports, cloud DVR capability ranging from 250 or 1000 hours on standard plans, and is available on Roku, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Chromecast, Samsung Smart TVs, Xbox One, Android TV, Android Smart TVs, and Android/iOS smartphones and tablets, with plans ranging from $24.99/month to $79.99/month (not including add-ons).

[They have also recently acquired one company and have made plans to acquire another to allow for in-house sports betting. They have stated in a press release that they plan to release a sportsbook before the end of the year.](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/fubotv-accelerates-development-sportsbook-140000632.html) This will push them into a broader spectrum outside of only TV and sports streaming, and into the sports betting sector along with DraftKings ($DKNG), FanDuel ($PDYPY), and Penn National Gaming ($PENN).

[**Plans and Add-ons**](https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/channels)

FuboTV offers three standardized plans as of February 8, 2021: the Family plan is priced at $64.99/month (normally $75.97/month), Elite at $79.99/month (normally $100.95/month), and Latino Quarterly at $24.99/month, along with offering additional add-ons. Each plan offers a range of channels, cloud DVR capabilities (which allows fast-forwarding through commercials), and casting to multiple devices simultaneously. Only the Elite plan does not offer a 7-day free trial (*Channels page).*

The Family plan includes 117 channels (mostly news and entertainment with roughly 40 that offer sports, including ESPN), up to 250 hours of DVR space, and casting to 3 devices at once. The quarterly prepaid includes a free upgrade to 1000 hours of DVR space and 5 casting devices at home with 3 on the go (*Channels page).*

The Elite plan includes 164 channels (includes an additional “47 entertainment channels”), up to 1000 hours of DVR space, and casting to 5 devices at home with 3 on the go. This plan does not offer a quarterly prepaid (*Channels page).*

The Latino Quarterly plan includes 250 hours of DVR space and can be streamed on up to 3 devices at once, but only has 32 channels. This plan needs to be prepaid every 3 months for a total charge of $74.97 and does not offer a monthly service (*Channels page).*

Upgrades include additional DVR space--1000 hours for an additional $6.99/month for the Family and Latino Quarterly--and increased device casting--an additional 2 devices at home with 3 on the go for another $9.99/month for the Family and Latino Quarterly plans. You can also add a variety of channels and sports packages (the Latino Quarterly has fewer channel add-ons compared to the Family and Elite plans, which both have the same channel varieties). Sports Plus with NFL RedZone is an additional $10.99/month, but includes all professional and college sports broadcasting services for football, basketball, baseball, hockey, tennis, fighting, etc. (*Channels page).*

Fubo has recently removed its former Standard plan, which included only 65 channels, up to 2 casting devices, and only 30 hours of DVR support for $60/month.

**Financials and Growth**

Fubo has yet to file an annual report as they have gone public in October of 2020, but they have filed a [10-Q](https://s21.q4cdn.com/819998841/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/16be93b6-1b43-471a-a81f-a8b07e43e47c.pdf) for Q3 2020. All numbers in thousands.

Assets-

Between December 31, 2019 and September of 2020, assets have increased from $368,225 to $799,313 (a 117% increase) . Total current assets increased from $17,973 to $58,016, but accounts receivable decreased from $8,904 to $6,975--this may be attributed to the increase in prepaid subscriptions which increased from $1,445 to $12,177 which shows strong customer satisfaction and retention.

Liabilities-

Liabilities have increased from $145,049 to $290,376 (a 100% increase). The largest contributors to their liabilities are “Due to related parties” increasing from $665 to $85,847, “Warrant liabilities” increasing from $24 to $28,085, and “Accounts payable” from $36,373 to $61,679. Long-term borrowings have decreased from $43,982 to $25,905.

Revenues-

Subscription revenues increased by $53,433, totaling $92,945 for the year. Total revenues including advertisements and licensing have increased by $61,202, totaling $112,669 for the year and an increase of 47% YOY. Q4 revenue is estimated to be between $94,000 and $98,000 which would be a 77-84% increase YOY.

Expenses-

Subscriber related expenses total $114,315 for the year. Total expenses have totaled $500,249 for the year.

Subscribers-

Ended Q3 with 455,000 paid subscribers, a YOY increase of 58%, and plans to end 2020 with over 545,000, an increase of 72% YOY.

**The vMVPD Sector**

Cord-cutting has become increasingly popular over the last few years with consumers dropping traditional cable and satellite networks in favor of streaming services--such as Hulu, Netflix, Disney+, etc.--and vMVPD services.

[In 2019 alone, 6.3 million people cut their cable connection, totaling 39.3 million. In a survey of what they might miss most from cable networks, 52% said they don’t miss anything, 23% missed live events on TV, 22% missed news, and 19% missed live sports](https://www.emarketer.com/content/most-cord-cutters-aren-t-missing-cable-tv)*.* Although not all of those that miss aspects of cable will pay for another subscription service, the sentiment exists for a sports-focused platform that offers other large networks as well.

[Another report by Parks Associates reveals that 17% of vMVPD subscribers switched from traditional TV within the last twelve months. In the same report, a survey conducted on current broadband households determined that 43% were “likely to switch to a… vMVPD within the next 12 months](https://www.broadbandtechreport.com/video/article/14196415/report-examines-vmvpd-sector-growth-in-broadband-pay-tv-market)*.""* The potential growth exists for the live digital broadcasting space, although it is slowing down.

With the spread of COVID and quarantines, people have been spending more time at home. When things open and quarantines end, that will be the true test for these providers as people will spend less time watching TV.

**The Sports Betting Sector**

Legal sports betting has taken a huge leap in recent years with the introduction of online sports betting; the ability to place wagers from anywhere at any time and have instant gratification has boomed with its slow legalization. [This sector has a forecasted value of $150 billion with other competitors already having a completed project and vast market share. In 2019, DraftKings ($DKNG) and FanDuel (PDYPY) controlled 83% of the market share](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/27/fanduel-draftkings-race-to-win-150-billion-sports-betting-market.html).

[FuboTV plans to join into this space with its own sportsbook. Their recent acquisition of Balto Sports in December of 2020, whose business was in simulating fantasy sports games, is Fubo’s first step into sports wagering. They plan to create a free-to-play gaming system alongside online sports wagering](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201201006185/en/fuboTV-Acquires-Balto-Sports-as-First-Step-Into-Online-Sports-Wagering-Market)*.*

[Their next planned acquisition, which was announced in January of 2021, will be to acquire Vigtory, a sports betting and interactive gaming company. According to BusinessWire, they plan to utilize Vigtory’s “sportsbook platform and digital gaming assets, and its consumer-driven betting technology, to develop a frictionless betting experience for fubo’s customers](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210112005596/en/fuboTV-Accelerates-Development-of-Sportsbook).""

These recent acquisitions set Fubo up to create an all-in-one viewing and betting experience, which could add new customers to their subscriber list and seal them into online wagering.

[It has been over two years since the Supreme Court has denied the federal ban on sports betting, which would have made online betting illegal in all of the United States. Currently, more than two dozen states have legalized sports betting, but most have only legalized in-person betting. More states may be willing to legalize to take advantage of the increased revenues and taxes associated with gambling and online wagering. As of 2020, six additional states plan to legalize some form of betting, although some are only allowing in-person. There are an additional 14 states that are considering the notion to allow legal gambling, whether in-person, online, or tribal](https://www.actionnetwork.com/news/legal-sports-betting-united-states-projections).

**Management and Investors**

David Gandler - CEO / Director / Co-Founder

Appointed as CEO and director in April of 2020. Prior to Fubo, Gandler had a 15 year career in marketing and advertising in local broadcast and cable TV within both general and Hispanic markets at companies such as Time Warner, Telemundo, and Scripps Networks Interactive.

Alberto Horihuela - CMO / Co-founder

In charge of marketing, Horihuela was head of Latin America for SVOD service DramaFever.

Simone Nardi - CFO

Nardi has worked as SVP and CFO of Scripps Networks Interactive where he was responsible for the finance and strategic planning for the company’s international business. Was also a key player in refinancing TVN S.A.’s billion dollar debt.

Large Investors

* Islet Management, LP with 5,108124 shares
* Morgan Stanley with 3,317,333 shares
* FMR LLC with 1,262,907 shares
* BlackRock Inc. with 956,678 shares
* Merger with FaceBank for $100 million revolving credit

**Analysts and Estimates**

Average analyst ratings put Fubo at a Buy to Strong Buy rating with an average price target of $45.50 with a high of $60 and a low of $30. EPS estimates are estimated to be -5.23 for 2020 and -1.64 for 2021.

Currently has a short float of about 75%, but the short volume has been holding at roughly 15-20% over the last month and has drastically declined from its October short volume of over 50%.

Originally valued at $700 million less than a year ago, a current valuation of $3.19 billion is respectable for this company and is on par for its current performance.

**Risks**

* Marketing fails and Fubo is never known as a household name, so consumers stick with other more known providers
* Their sportsbook fails and becomes dead weight and wasted money
* Subscriber count and streaming drops as quarantine lifts, reducing revenues while maintaining expenses
* Consumers opt for cheaper options
* People paying for the sports package cancel when the season is over, creating a boom and bust cycle if not managed correctly

**Final Thoughts / TL;DR**

With its drastic growth over the last year (400% in the last 4 months), support from FaceBank and well-known investors, and plans to join the sports betting sector, FuboTV has potential to become a household name and grow well beyond its current valuation by combining both sports broadcasting and online sports betting into one convenient place. Although unlikely to overthrow any of the current forces, it can become the best live sports broadcaster that people can turn to when they cut cable but want to keep live sports. It has many hurdles to overcome (creating their sportsbook, better marketing, increasing subscriber count, etc.) before it is any real competition to its already established competition.

At a $3.19 billion market cap and very high (75%) short interest, it will be very difficult to realize consistent growth, but it is on par for a company with almost $100 million in revenue.

**My Position**

25 shares at $47.30

2021-03-15 18:58:48,Advice on what to add to my portfolio needed 💵,"Hello looking for some advice on some stocks to add positions to in the coming weeks/months. I have about 50K of cash ready to deploy at appropriate moments, not all of it at once necessarily, but looking for good entry points, primarily in tech and growth sectors. All these positions will be long holds at minimum 5 years ideally 10-15 for most. I am 24 years old I have a fairly well diversified portfolio that I have been growing and building for a little less than a decade; holdings are listed below. I have a medium - high risk tolerance for this final chunk of cash to deploy. I'm planning to potentially increase my positions in PLTR, FB, DOCU PYPL and DIS and maybe a few others but as I said I'm also looking for some names to add that aren't on this list. I'd like to find a few names that have lots of room for potential growth even if they are on the risky side but high potential payouts. I have a well balanced portfolio with a large percentage of my assets in ETF's and low risk assets so I'm looking for a few more speculative, aggressive plays to make, any and all advice is welcome; as well as comments/critiques on my current holdings.

2021-02-07 02:25:29,What are the most common mistakes you see newbies make?,"I recently got into the market with this whole GME debacle (still ongoing?), but it has made me more interested in the market as a whole. I've spent most of the past two weeks reading about topics such as DD, some of the stocks that are popular here and on other investing-related subreddits, and the basics of options (CC, CSP, long calls/puts, wheel). At the same time, looking through a variety of stocks makes me feel like a lot of potential for putting some money into the market now and it feels like the majority of moves would be profitable. I recognize part of that is likely because of the current bull market. However, if you were to just stick with buying stable stocks (e.g. GOOG, AAPL) or even buying/selling options barely OTM with a decent expiration date, seems like you could make pretty easy money.

I can foresee a couple of scenarios where there is potential for big losses:

1) Market crashes. Certainly many posts saying we are due for a correction and we did have one in 3/2020.

2) Meme stocks and buying in at the wrong time

3) Options trades you don't understand

4) Trying to make plays that are just too risky (0DTE, far OTM weeklys)

The price point right now is perfect from a tech analysis stand point.    The $ 57 level is not a random number, it was a previous resistance ( Jan 8) and according to the principal of polarity, it is supposed to work as a support now, and it seems this is exactly what [NIO ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-NIO/)is doing.  Strong support at the $57 level all week so far. 

1) lets start with something Juicy.    Call it a rumor if you want but NIO is building a second factory and will be working at lightspeed.  China has a huge workforce that works around the clock.  I know first hand that Countries such as Israel and UAE Dubai they hire Chinese construction firms because they get the job done the fastest efficiently.   China built hospitals from the ground up in 10 days during the early days of the pandemic in Wuhan.  Overnight Highway improvements is not unusual for them.  They can build a bridge overpass overnight.

 Please note the 60 day is just the ""earthwork"" which I assume means leveling the ground ready for construction. 

Translated as follows:

The second factory of Jianghuai Weilai started bidding and is expected to be put into operation within the year

01-15 08:42 Cenard (Beijing) Information Technology Official Account, Car Master, Quality Creator attention \[Aika Auto Industry Information Original\] Recently, the bidding announcement exposed on the Internet shows that Jianghuai NIO is bidding for its manufacturing base. The new base construction site is located in the section of Jiangnan Road, Economic Development Zone, Hefei City. According to the 60-day planned construction period shown in the tender document, it is expected that the second factory of Jianghuai Weilai will be completed and put into production within this year.

It is worth mentioning that the Jianghuai Weilai manufacturing base has just been selected as the 2020 Anhui Smart Factory. The Jianghuai Weilai manufacturing base, which started in October 2016, was completed in one year and three months, and delivered more than 10,000 units that year. As of November 2020, nearly 80,000 units of ES8 and ES6 models have been delivered. EC6 sales have continued to increase since mass production and delivery started in September. With the launch of ET7, the construction of the second factory also prepares for future sales growth.

1-2) Second to this Great news The current JAC factory is expanding to meet demands and future growth.

A strong dollar has recently been a headwind for many U.S. multinationals. Facebook, for its part, reported its Q4 revenue growth was 33% in constant currency but only 30% in dollars. Google, which got 54% of its revenue from international markets in Q3, undoubtedly felt the effects of a strong dollar as well in Q4. However, the company has had success over the years at using currency hedging programs to limit the damage done by forex swings. Google will likely surprise for the better on this issue. 

Also, the fact that the Pixel 3 and 3 XL (launched in October) was available in more markets than the Pixel 2 and 2 XL were a year earlier will likely give a boost to revenue. The pixel 3 got great reviews and I know a lot of people who received them for Christmas or bought them themselves. 

Tl;dr: Other companies did well with ad revenue this quarter, google is good at limiting damage done by forex swings, and the Google pixel probably sold better than expected.

2021-03-03 14:06:27,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, March 3, 2021.","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, March 3, 2021**

Stocks fell for the second straight day, with technology stocks dropping sharply as the Treasury yield ticked higher once again. The S&P 500 fell 1.3%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 2.7%, the second consecutive decline for the tech-heavy index. The Dow Jones Industrial Average held up better, edging down 0.4%.

President Biden said his administration expects to have enough COVID-19 vaccines for any adult that wants it by the end of May, pulling the targets two months closer than the previous government estimate. As a reminder, over the weekend, Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ) single dose vaccine received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), making it the third coronavirus vaccine available in the US, following Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA). Drugmaker Merck (MRK) announced it was going to help Johnson & Johnson produce its coronavirus vaccine. 

In other news, lawmakers in the Senate are set to begin debating President Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus, which was passed by the House of Representatives recently. Democrats are racing to push the legislation forward before the mid-March expiry of augmented Federal unemployment benefits. Republicans do not support the bill because of its size, but through a process called reconciliation. Reconciliation is a way for Congress to enact legislation on taxes, spending, and the debt limit with a simple majority (51 votes, or 50 if the vice president breaks a tie) in the Senate, avoiding the threat of a filibuster, which requires a 60 vote supermajority to overcome. Because Democrats have 50 seats in the Senate—plus a Democratic vice president—reconciliation is a way to get a tax-and-spending bill to the president’s desk even if all 50 Republicans oppose it

The likelihood of more stimulus and widespread business reopenings as the vaccine is distributewd has raised the specter of both speedy growth in the U.S. economy and rising inflationary pressures. Last week's jump in Treasury yields – with the benchmark 10-year yield reaching a one-year high of 1.61% – remains fresh in the minds of investors, who have been eyeing the rise in interest rates as a possible hindrance to the recovery and deviation from last year's ultra-low borrowing costs backdrop. The 10-year Treasury yield currently sits at 1.48% at the time of writing.

2021-02-13 11:39:40,($FB) Facebook Undervalued,"Facebook looks to be undervalued by up to 20% in this current ""probably inflated"" market.

I did a quick comparison between FB/MSFT/GOOG/APPL.

Obviously, these companies are not direct competitors but due to size and industry, they seem worthy for a little comparison.

&#x200B;

**P.E** \- FB: 26, GOOG: 35.14, MSFT:35.86, AAPL:36.72

**Revenue-growth 2020 -** FB: 22%, MSFT:14%, GOOG: 13%, APPL: 5.4%

**Average revenue-growth (3 years)** \- FB: 29%, MSFT:14%, GOOG: 18%, APPL: 6%

**FB Average P.E for the last 6 months**: 29.5

&#x200B;

**Market Cap**: 770bn

**Equity:** 128bn (61 of which is liquid assets/cash)

It is clear that Facebook is still growing at a faster rate than other companies, but this does not seem to be priced in.

Even is it reaches a 6-month average price based on P.E you could see a quick 10% + return

Instead they did so much stock buyback, and dividend payout instead of buying companies when they had the chance like TSLA, NFLX, others... Biggest AAPL acquisition was Beats headphone business lol Now there is talk of Apple car and Apple TV already sucks. Are they just wuss? what are they afraid of in buying successful business like their competitors. 

Even though apple is the biggest company right now, thinking long term 10-15 years from now. I actually think when its all set and done, I see AMZN and MSFT to be WAY bigger companies than AAPL. Because they have shown risk taking and investing in other companies and successfully vertically integrating that in their business model

2021-02-10 11:19:03,A brief look and DD on QUBT,"I’m sure everyone is aware of AI and how artificial intelligence has become this buzzword that people use to sell something or grab your attention. There’s no doubt that artificial intelligence is here to stay and that it’s impacts have been tremendous, but there is a new player in town that goes by the name of Quantum Computing. A brief explanation of QC(Quantum Computing), QC completely changes the way computational problems are solved. On a classical computer you are dealing with binary pieces of information that can only solve certain types of problems, this means that some things are unsolvable. Enter QC, this is able to use particles slowed down to bear absolute zero and use their motion as means for computing(this is a very brief explanation and I urge you to research more if you are interested). Because of QC companies can now solve problems that were previously impossible, and right now there are a very limited amount of companies invested in QC. Companies like MSFT, GOOG and IBM own and create quantum computers but right now there is no easy way for businesses to access there potential. QUBT has made proprietary software that bridges the gap between the two and its really amazing. Not only do they allow customers direct access to the worlds top class quantum computers, but they also allow customers to run programs that can simulate them in classical computers. This means that Companies won’t have to change drastically to get the benefits of QC. This isn’t a huge financial analysis or a deep dive into the company, however I believe that if you wish to get in on something revolutionary, now is the time with QUBT.

So I am trying to understand how Robo taxi and autonomous helps tsla justify this valuation but doesn't help GOOG and AMZN at all. Because they can actually vertically integrate these services into their business. Imagine Booking a waymo ride from Google Maps which is already installed on like BILLIONS of devices? same with Zoox, they can integrate it with Amazon Prime membership

Don't buy into the TSLA cult when they try to sell you on autonomous and robo taxi. There are other tech companies like NVDA, AMZN and GOOG already ahead of the game with vertical integration in their products

2020-12-17 13:34:07,Understanding The Market Requires You To Understand Market Psychology,"Stock market intraday patterns – all times are in Eastern Standard Time!

When day trading the US stock market you may notice certain patterns, based on the time of day, that occur more often than not. These patterns, or tendencies, happen often enough for professional day traders to base their trading around them.

&#x200B;

9:30am: The stock market opens, and there is an initial push in one direction. Highly volatile!

&#x200B;

9:45am: The initial push often sees a significant reversal or pullback. This is often just a short-term shift, and then the original trending direction re-asserts itself.

&#x200B;

10:00am: If the trend that began at 9:30am is still happening, it will often be challenged around this time. This tends to be another time where there is a significant reversal or pullback.

&#x200B;

11:15am-11:30am: The market is heading into lunch hour, and London is getting ready to close. This is when volatility will typically die out for a few hours, but often the daily high or low will be tested around this time. European traders will usually close out positions or accumulate a position before they finish for the day. Whether the highs or lows are tested or not, the markets tend to ‘drift’ for the next hour or more. 

&#x200B;

11:45am-1:30pm: This is lunch time in New York, plus a bit of a time buffer. Usually, this is the quietest time of the day, and often, day traders like to avoid it.

&#x200B;

1:30pm-2:00pm: If the lunch hour was calm, then expect a breakout of the range established during lunch hour. Often, the market will try to move in the direction it was trading in before the lunch hour doldrums set in.

&#x200B;

2:00pm-2:45pm: The close is getting closer, and many traders are trading with the trend thinking it will continue into close. That may happen, but expect some sharp reversals around this time, because on the flip side, man traders are quicker to take profits or move their trailing stop losses closer to the current price.

\---

3:00pm-3:30pm: These are big “Shake-out” points, in that they will force many traders out of their positions. If a reversal of the prior trend occurs around this time, then the price is likely to move very strongly in the opposite direction. Even if the prior trend does sustain itself through these periods, expect some quick and sizable counter-trend moves.

&#x200B;

As a day trader, its best to be nimble and not get tied into one position or direction. Many traders only trade the first hour and the last hour of every day, as these times are the most volatile.

&#x200B;

3:30pm-4:00pm: The market closes at 4pm. After that, the liquidity dries up in nearly all stocks and ETFs, except for the very active ones. It’s common to close all positions a minute or more before the closing bell, unless you have orders placed to close your position on a closing auction or “cross”. 

Trade Entry Checklist - Things to Consider before entering a trade

1.    Portfolio fit – Make sure you diversify your portfolio. If you have 9 open bullish positions, consider a bearish stance elsewhere to balance your portfolio and reduce risk.

2.    Liquidity Check – If the stock you are considering has enough stocks traded per day. This can easily be found on Yahoo! Finance – look for “Average Volume.” Look for contract strikes that have at least 1,000 contracts of open interest – this minimizes bid/ask spread and ensures market liquidity so that you can actually enter/exit trades easily.

3.    IV Percentile  – Example: AAPL has IV of 45%, but IV percentile of 85%. This means that 85% of the time over the last year, volatility will be lower than it is right now as it’s current actual IV (45%). Likewise, if GOOG has an IV of 45% but an IV rank of 25%, then only 25% of the time over the last year IV was lower than it’s current value (45%). This means we have a 75% chance that IV will increase on average, meaning it’s current volatility is low – and we want to buy into that. If IV is between 70%-100% you will need to actively monitor that trade, higher risk.

4.    Options strategy - Pretty straight forward- If IV is high and the price of the underlying is also high, we can eliminate bullish strategies and focus on bearish, and vice versa.

5.    Strike Price – First you need to determine if you want an in the money (ITM) or out of the money (OTM). An ITM option has a greater sensitivity – delta – to the price of the underlying stock. So if the stock price increases by a given amount, the ITM call would gain more than an ATM or OTM call. This also means it would decline more than others if the price falls. ITM calls are more expensive as well – higher intrinsic value.

&#x200B;

Next consideration is risk/reward. An ITM option carrier less risk, but costs more. If you only want to stake a small amount of capital in a trade, an OTM position may be your best choice. OTM positions are riskier, cheaper, and potentially much more profitable if the stock surges past your strike price.

6.    Expiration – Date similarly to strike price, the further out a contracts expiration is, the higher the premium because time is on your side. There is a higher chance of the stock  meeting your OTM target price given a year to do so, compared to a week. This is called Theta – a quantification of how much value is lost due to the passing of time. Theta also grows exponentially as you near the expiration date – your $190 strike call will be worth very little if the call expires tomorrow and the stock is at $180 because the probability of the stock reaching $190 is low.

7.    Position size – This is important – BIG TRADING POSITIONS WILL EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF BLOWING UP YOUR ACCOUNT. We suggest you place trades utilizing only 1-5% of your total account value, with an emphasis on the lower end. Play it safe, round down. It’s much easier to recover from a -5% loss than -80%.

8.    Future moves – Think beyond what’s going on with a stock than just in the current day – unless youre scalping. Is there an earnings report coming up? Can I roll this into the next month if I need to? Is there an upcoming dividend payout? Take the time to plan your positions and don’t rush your entry – You want to ensure the best possibility of success. I’d take $500 profit with a 90% success rate over $750 profit with a 50% success rate any day. You want to build consistency, and plan your positions before you take them.

2020-08-27 18:58:08,"How I applied Buffet's strategies to my own portfolio, +70% networth, beat SP500 by 40%","I believe I did pretty well in the market this year. My networth increased ~65% since its lowest point in March, [~350k to 620k](https://imgur.com/a/3Vu6u2f). 20k from the car I bought in March. I rolled over a 401k and it messed up Mint's reporting, hence the spike from Jul -> Aug. 

I beat the [SP500 by 40%](https://imgur.com/a/adeDokD) in my YOLO account, my FAANG account went from [180->300](https://imgur.com/a/kBmBp1O)

I did this by following some basic investing principles, buying and holding for the most part, being patient, and only investing in areas which I have expertise in. 

I did not buy into the TSLA hype, nor do I play options, nor do I play crypto. 

#High level advice:
=========================================

I picked the 7 I agree with.

1. Invest in what you know…and nothing more.
2. Never compromise on business quality
3. When you buy a stock, plan to hold it forever
4. Diversification can be dangerous
5. Most news is noise, not news (don't read articles about investing)
8. The best moves are usually boring (buy and hold)
10. Only listen to those you know and trust 

I firmly believe that anyone who follows those concepts, they will find success in investing.  

#General mindset:
================
- Keep emotions out of the market
- Don't bother timing the market. Don't get ruled by FOMO.
- Understand that for some stocks, you can't really average cost down. You will have to stomach buying the stock at a higher entry point. My refusal to average up early on caused me to miss out on a lot of gains. 
- Understand the difference between trading, investing, and gambling. 
- Have an exit strategy (stop losses would have helped me a lot in March, I now learned from my expensive mistake)
- Be greedy-- not TOO greedy. If a stock pops 10%, I will sell half to lock in profits. It's super common to see a lot of companies pop and the next day dip a bit due to sell off. Perfect time to grab more on the dip. This is obviously impossible to time, which is why I only sell half. 

#Application:
==================================================================
I was very specific in the types of companies I would choose to invest in within tech. I decided to follow my strengths. As a data engineer, I'm very intimate with cloud technologies, and I think I generally have pretty sharp business acumen and good strategic direction. 

As a result, my day to day work had me using a ton of technologies in the cloud space. I've used Splunk, NewRelic, Twilio, AWS, GCP, Hortonworks/Cloudera, Oracle, Tableau, Datadog, Sendgrid (bought by Twilio), Dropbox/box, Slack, Salesforce, Marketo, Databricks, Snowflake, HP Vertica, just to name a few. I was familiar with CDN services like Fastly and Cloudflare because sometimes, I worked with the DevOps and IT guys. 

Based on industry hearsay, day to day work, eventually, I got a good ""feel"" of what technologies were widely adopted, easy to use, and had a good reputation in the industry. Similarly, I also got a feel for what tech were being considered 'dated' or not widely used (HP, Oracle, Cloudera, Dropbox, Box). 

I tend to shy away from companies that I don't understand. In the past, most times I've done that-- I got burned.  My biggest losers this year was betting on $NAT and $JMNA (10k total loss). After learning from those mistakes, I decided to only focus on investing in companies that either I or my peers have intimate first hand experience with using. Because of this rationale, the majority of stocks in my portfolio are products which I believe in, I thoroughly enjoy using, and I would recommend to my friends, family, and colleagues. 

Post COVID, due to the shift to remote work and increase in online shopping I decided to double down on tech. I already knew that eCommerce was the next big thing. I made very early investments into SHOP and Amazon in 2017 for that reason.

My hypothesis was that post-COVID, the shift on increased online activity, remote work, and eCommerce would mean that companies which build tools to support increased online activity should also increase. I decided to choose three sectors within tech to narrow down-- these were three sectors that I had a good understanding of, due to the nature of my work and personal habits. 

1. eCommerce + AdTech 
2. IT/DevOps (increased online activity means higher need for infra)
3. FinTech (increased shopping activity means more transactions)

These are the points I consider before I consider jumping into a stock:

1. Do I feel good about using the company? Do I believe in the company's vision?
2. Where do I see this company in 5 years? 10 years? Do I see my potential children being around to use these companies?
3. What does YoY, QoQ growth look like for this company? 
4. Is/Will this product be a core part of how businesses or people operate?
5. Who are their customers and target demographic?
6. (SaaS) Customer testimonials, white papers, case studies. If it's for a technology, I'm going to want to read a paper or use case.

In March, I took what I believe to be an ""educated gamble"". When the market crashed, I liquefied most of my non tech assets and reinvested them into tech. Some of the holdings I already had, some holdings were newly purchased.

*EDIT* ^^^ this isn't called timing the market you /r/wsb imbeciles. Timing the market would be trying to figure out when to PULL OUT during ATH and then buying the dip. I SOLD at the lowest point, and I with the cash I sold AT A LOSS, I reinvested that cash and doubled down into tech. If I sold in Feb, and bought back in March, that would be calling timing the market. What I am doing is called REINVESTING/REBALANCING... not timing the market. 

I have 50% of my networth in AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, FB, NFLX, and the rest in individual securities/mutual funds. I have 3 shares of TSLA that I got in @1.5.

Here are the non FAANGs I chose.

1. $SQ. I had already been invested in SQ since 2016. I made several bad trades, holding when it first blew past 90 until I sold it at 70... bought in again last year at 60s, after noticing that more and more B&M stores were getting rid of their clunky POS systems and replacing it with Square's physical readers. After COVID, I noticed a lot of pop up vendors, restaurants doing take out. A Square reader made transactions very easy to make post-COVID. 

2. $ATVI. Call of Duty and Candy Crush print money for them. I've been a Blizzard fanboy since I was a kid, so I have to keep this just out of principle.

3. $SHOP. They turned a profit this year, and I think there is still a lot more room to grow. It's become somewhat of a household name. I've met quite a few people who mentioned that they have a Shopify site set up to do their side hustle. I've tried the product myself, and can definitely attest that it's pretty easy to get an online shop up and running within a day. I 5.5xed my return here. 

4. $BIGC. I bought into this shortly after IPO. I'm very excited to see an American Shopify. BigC focuses on enterprise customers right now, and Shopify independent merchants, so I don't see them directly competing. I'm self aware this is essentially a gamble. I got in at 90, sold at 140, and added more in 120s. I def got lucky here... it's not common for IPOs to pop so suddenly. I honestly wasn't expecting it to pop so soon.

5. $OKTA. Best in class SSO tool. Amazing tool that keeps tracks of all of my sign-ons at work. 

6. $DDOG. Great monitoring tool. Widely adopted and good recommendations throughout the industry. Always had a nice looking booth at GoogleNext.

7. $ZM. Zoom was the only video conf tool at work which I had a good time using. Adoption had blown up pre-COVID already in the tech world, and post-COVID, they somehow became a noun. ""Zoom parties"" and ""Zoom dates"" somehow became a thing interwoven into peoples' day to day lives.

8. $TWLO. Twilio sells APIs which allow applications to send messages like text, voice, and video chat. For example, when DoorDash sends you a text at 1 AM reminding you that your bad decision has arrived, that text is powered by Twilio. In March, New York announced that they were going to use Twilio to send SMS notifs for COVID contact tracing. 

10. $NET/$FSTY. These two two seem like the ones best poised for growth in the CDN space. This is based off of industry exposure and chatting with people who work in DevOps.

11. $DOCU. people aren't going to office to sign stuff, super easy to use, I like their product. 

12. $WMT. eComm, streaming, and a very substantial engineering investment makes me think they have room to grow. Also I really need to diversify. 

13. $COST. When is the last time you heard someone say ""Man I hate going to Costco and paying $1.50 for a hotdog and soda?"" Diversification. Also cheap hotdogs.

14. $NVDA/AMD. GPUs are the present and the future. Not only are they used for video games, but Machine Learning now uses GPU instead of CPU to do compute (Tensorflow for example). Crypto is still a thing as well, and there will always been a constant need for GPUs.

Mutual funds/ETFs
1. $FSCSX. MF which focuses on FinTech. 

2. $VTSAX Pretty much moves with the SP500. 

3. $WCLD. Holdings include Salesforce, Workday, Zuora, Atlassian, Okta, New Relic, Fastly... 

Titanvest:
I was an early access user, and I was able to secure 0% fees for my accout. 36% gains so far. I like them, because their portfolio happens to include shares of tech giants that I either don't have individual stocks for or my stake is low (CRM, PPYL). It nicely complements my existing portfolio.

#Some things I do that that are against the grain:

- Not really diversified. 80% is in tech. They are in very different sectors of tech, but the truth is, when tech falls, all of these companies fall. I'm obviously long tech and I do not believe that tech will fall anytime soon. What about the dot com bubble? There wasn't a single dot com company that was integral in our lives. The internet was in its infancy then. Techonology is now such an interwoven part of our lives and I see companies like Apple, Amazon, Google to be sticking around for several generations.

- I don't read investing articles. I think people who write articles about a stock all have ulterior motives-- to pump or to dump. Case in point-- Citron Research spent years writing articles telling people how SHOP was overvalued. Why did they do that? Because they were shorters at the time. I turned 5k into 27k, because I held on to most of my SHOP shares.

- I don't take much value from balance sheets, other than net loss, income, YoY growth. Instead, I use my business acumen to try to pick up on info that isn't super apparent from Google. For example, one thing I always do is that I look at the career page to see how the business is growing. Increase on marketing/sales/implementation engineers is typically a solid sign that a company is preparing headcount to take new deals in the upcoming quarters. I look at the product road map, supported integrations, and customer base. 

One example was how I applied the above principle was to WalMart. In 2018 I noticed that I was getting targeted by a lot of Data engineering job listing for WalMartLabs-- WarMart's tech division. The role was to build out a big data pipeline to support their eCommerce platform. WalMart's online store released in Q3 of 2019. Post COVID, I used their online store and it was a seamless experience. They even offer a 5% cash back card like Amazon. They reported strong Q4 sales last year, and they did very well post COVID. Why did I choose to invest in $WMT? Because I believe that Wal-Mart has room to grow for their online platform. 

Lastly... remember that wealth isn't accrued over time. It takes years to build. The quickest way to increase your wealth is by investing in yourself-- your career and earning potential. The sooner my income increased, the quicker I had more capital to buy into stocks. 

Also, if you've gotten this far, the point of my post isn't to say that you should invest into tech. The message I'm trying to get across is-- when picking companies, pick companies in fields or verticals you have good knowledge in. Heed Buffet's advice to only pick companies you believe in and understand. Play to your strengths, don't mindless toss money based on one person's posts on Reddit-- always do your own due diligence. Use DD as a guide and use personal research and experience to drive your decision.",2169,0.84

This is the first time we've seen GCP broken out.  GCP lost $5.61 billion during the full year, and $1.24 billion during Q4, showing that the business is still in investment mode. By way of contrast, Amazon’s cloud business earned an operating profit of $13.53 billion last year and $3.56 billion last quarter.

I'm taking this to be a loss leader.  Cloud for me is the future, all the companies I work with are investing in Cloud, but interestingly none I work with are in GCP, it's really AWS by a long margin to Azure.

Otherwise, I like everything I'm seeing with GOOG.  I'm long and will hold, but I really want to see GCP improve.",10,0.82

What Happened: Silverblatt said S&P 500’s price-earnings ratio for the coming year will increase from 22.3 to 22.6 with the electric vehicle maker’s addition, CNBC reported Sunday. For every $11.1 Tesla moves, the S&P 500 will fluctuate by one point, as per the analyst.

S&P 500’s dividend yield will dip from 1.56% to 1.53%, Silverblatt said in a note, as per CNBC.

Why It Matters: Tesla will become the fifth largest constituent of the S&P 500 on Monday with the 1.69% weighting.

See Also: Tesla's Valuation Is Greater Than Nearly The Entire Established Auto Industry

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) leads the charts with 6.47%, according to Silverblatt. Other companies ahead of the Elon Musk-led automaker include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT),Amazon .com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB).

Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Class A and Class C shares have 1.66% and 1.61% weighting, respectively.

Goldman Sachs analysts last week said Tesla’s addition to S&P 500 will not make the index more expensive, noting that the aggregate index P/E multiple of S&P 500 will be lifted by slightly less than 1.5% on the EV maker’s inclusion.

2021-03-09 10:06:44,"Buy with proceeds of a sale, with both orders as limit orders?","The title describes what I would want to do, but taken literally, I think it's impossible, because the cash is not available for trading until I have the proceeds. I can best describe my question with an example. I'll just say AAPL and GOOG instead of Stock A and Stock B.  Say I want to sell my shares of GOOG and use the proceeds to buy shares of AAPL. However I would like to simultaneous have a sell limit order on GOOG and a buy limit order on AAPL. The problem is both stocks are riding the same wave. By the time GOOG is up to the price I want to sell, AAPL is above the price I want to buy it at. I was trying to figure out if it would help to add margin to my account, but in my scenario, I would basically need to margin 100% to buy AAPL and then pay it back when I sell GOOG when it reaches the price I want (presumably within the month). But 100% margin of course is not allowed. Is there any solution with options or some other way maybe?

2020-11-02 06:15:04,"Stock market news, updates & predictions , Should you Buy or Sell Now? [2-11-2020]"," So Friday we saw the stock market down again as the dow fell almost 0,6% percent while the s&p fell over 1% and the nasdaq was crushed being down almost 2and a half percent as This last week we saw the dow fell 6,5% the s&p 5,6% and the nasdaq 5,5% as all 3 ended the month of october down more than 2,3%

One good thing for the US economy is that the retail stores sales has recovered and consumers are still spending excess cash especially with the holidays and black Friday up next. I believe that as much as Tuesday is important for the economy, the events that will come later in the week as the FED holds two important meatings and the latest jobs report comes in at the end of the week far outweight that

As you can see the New York Federal bank economic index is still rising, that sugests a V-Shaped recovery is continuing in the US. This index takes into consideration lots of important data from the economy.

The unemployment in the US has been decling but that rate has sharply slowed down in the last months as it’s still more than double the 3,5% at the start of the year as the latest number from September was almost 8% rate of unemployment.

As you can see the most affected people are still the middle and low wage under 60k/year. As the high wage jobs unemployment rate is barely down 0,5% since January.

So the fear in the stock market saw a huge pop in the last week as the VIX (the volatility index) rose from 27,55 more than 10 points to close at over 38 this last week. This next week is probably the last with such high volatility as the upcoming big events will pass and more certainty will be in front of us . The volatility was so high as we retested the June highs and have seen a pullback 3 times after hiting those levels.

Despite strong earnings last week from all big tech companies (Alphabet,Amazon,Apple, facebook and Microsoft) the companies stocks dropped amid the broader stock market sell-off with the exception of Google which posted terrific numbers to crush analysts expectation.

Apple is down almost 19% since the highs of September and has lost 450 billion dollars in market cap since then.

This dropped in the company has been caused by a broader stock market sell off as well as missed iphone revenues. I do believe that iphone revenues will see a huge spike in the next coming quarters as apple customers as myself will finally upgrade from older iphone to this next generation iphone which is the first to have 5G technology as well as other great improvements in capability as well as camera.

A couple analysts have recently changed they’re target to between 132-140 which is over 20$ from where it sit’s today. That is quite good upside for the company.

As you can see they are barely down 2,7% year over year in product revenue despite not having the new iphone launch included in this financials, and overall the company still saw a 1% increase in revenue due to the huge spike in services revenue that I believe will continue especially with the Apple One bundle just being launched at the end of last week. The Total Gross margin also increase slightly but I expect this to be just a small drawback in the short-term.

Also I believe that Amazon was dragged down because of the next quarter predictions of huge costs while they only forecasted a operating income of 1 to 4 point 5 billion dollars which is below what was anticipated despite amazon web services continuing to be the largest player in cloud spending. With a 32% share of total market and a revenue of 11,6 billion dollars which Is up 29% year over year, while Azure from Microsoft comes in second and google cloud in third. There is still a lot of room to grow for all of this companies as there is still over 37% of the market provided by other companies. Also this is a great company to own for the long term as digitazation and online commerce will continue to grow, some are estimating that by 2030 amazon could have annual revenues of 1 trillion dollars $ while using conservative projections of compound annual growth for e-commerce of 10%, for the cloud services of 15% and for ad revenue of 20%, amazon could hit that mark by then. But I believe this is possible even faster than that.

Facebook is the one company that I will have to analyze more in this group. They will be hit with privacy issues do to the regulatory risk and Apple’s announced privacy changes. But I still do believe this to be a great company as they also own Instagram, and I really like how that part of the company is innovating and growing.

While google seems to be back on track as the company was the laggard in the group. They have become less reliant on the search ad revenue as growth in Youtube ads and Google cloud will push the company to renewed growth in the future.

Alibaba will see two big events this week as they will kick off the singles day event next week, extending the event with 3 more days rather than the usual 24-hour event, in which they will also double the products on offer. Also another big event will be the IPO of ant Group in which Alibaba will still have a big stake. I believe they are a great company the forward revenue growth estimates of 31% are higher than other tech companies like amazon, google and Microsoft while the P/E for the company is the most attractive of the group also.

Ford just announced that late next year they will introduce a lower priced competitor for Tesla AutoPilot and GM’s super cruise, this is great news for the company as they seem to be improving the company continuasly.

Some important earnings coming this week are :

Paypal on Monday, which I believe is the greatest fin-tech company, on

The San Mateo, Calif.-based gaming platform features a variety of “3-D digital worlds” that are built by users and developers, providing virtual communities where users can play with friends. Roblox RBLX acknowledged in its official paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it is experiencing a huge boost from users isolated during shelter-in-place policies related to coronavirus, but seeks to appeal to a wider, and older, audience to continue growing when things go back to “normal.”

Roblox originally filed for an IPO on Nov. 19, after disclosing a month before that it was beginning the process. Roblox said in the original filing that it sought to raise up to $1 billion; this figure is typically a placeholder that will be updated in later filings, but suggests a larger fundraising goal than the typical large IPO, which uses a $100 million target.

Roblox expects to trade under the ticker “RBLX” on the New York Stock Exchange. There are six banks underwriting the deal, led by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and J.P. Morgan. 2020 has been a good year for IPOs with the Renaissance IPO ETF IPO up 94% for the year to date, compared with a 12% gain in the S&P 500 index SPX , and a 35% rise in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP .

Here are five things to know about Roblox as it becomes a public company.

1. If you don’t have tweens, you’ve probably never heard of it

If you haven’t heard of Roblox, you probably haven’t been around a pre-teen much in recent years. The company said that more than half of its 31.1 million daily users are younger than 13 years old. Back in 2018, the service claimed about 12 million daily users.

Since most online accounts require users to be at least 13, the company has faced criticism for inappropriate content on its service. In the prospectus, Roblox said it uses a human review team to screen content and has reviewed more than 68 million “assets” in the first nine months, and has “had a human respond” to more than 9 million customer inquiries within 10 minutes on average. The company hopes to appeal to older users and to retain current users as they grow up.

“We ultimately aim to be a brand that serves all ages,” the company said in its SEC filing. “An early sign of what is possible: our 17 to 24-year-old user age group grew faster than our core under 13 age group in the nine months ended September 30, 2020.”

2. COVID-19 generated a huge boost of traffic

When the pandemic hit, Roblox growth exploded as tweens and others who were sheltering in place flocked to the online community. The number of daily users surged 82% over the past 12 months and the average user was on the service for more than two-and-a-half hours a day.

“We have experienced rapid growth … given our users have been online more as a result of global COVID-19 shelter-in-place policies,” the company said.

In the first nine months of 2020, Roblox said DAUs, or daily average users, grew to 31.1 million from 17.1 million in the same period during 2019. Year-over-year, Roblox reported 17.6 million DAUs in 2019, compared with 12 million in 2018.

Similarly, total hours spent on Roblox more than doubled to 22.2 billion in the first nine months of 2020, compared with 10 billion in the same period in 2019. Year-over-year, users spent 13.7 billion hours on Roblox in 2019, versus 9.4 billion in 2018.

3. Its revenue is derived from the model that has Epic Games fighting Apple

Roblox makes money by using a virtual currency called “Robux” that users buy to upgrade avatar and make purchases, but that developers also use within the platform. That means Roblox pays a lot of money to third-party distributors like Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. at a time when those practices are being disputed by others.

Back in August, the popular videogame “Fortnite,” made by Epic Games, was banned from Apple’s AAPL App Store and Alphabet’s GOOG GOOGL Google Play stores because Epic tried to work around the 30% cuts the companies were getting from in-game purchases, and loudly disputed the practice.

Roblox said it also pays 30% of its one-time purchases to both Apple and Google when they are made on the respective stores. The company said for the first nine months of 2020, 34% of its revenue came from Apple store purchases and 18% from Google store purchases. That’s compared with 30% of revenue from Apple store purchases and 18% from Google store purchases in 2019.

The company said its bookings surged 171% to $1.24 billion in the first nine months of 2020, compared with $458 million in the same period in 2019. From 2018 to 2019, bookings grew 39%. If defines bookings as “sales of our virtual currency which we record as deferred revenue and then recognize that revenue over the estimated average lifetime of a paying user.”

Booking per DAU rose to $39.93 in the first nine months of 2020 from $26.75 in the year-earlier period.

In a nod to COVID-19’s part in the surge, the company said: “We do not expect these activity levels to be sustained, and in future periods we expect growth rates for our revenue to decline.”

4. As revenue has soared, losses have widened

While Roblox reported a 68% surge in revenue for the first nine months of 2020, losses for the period more than quadrupled.

Roblox reported revenue of $588.7 million and a loss of $203.2 million in the period, compared with $349.9 million in revenue and a loss of $46.3 million for the first nine months of 2019. Roblox reported revenue of$488.2 million and a narrower loss of $86 million in 2019, compared with revenue of $312.8 million and a loss of $97.2 million in 2018.

The biggest culprits in 2020’s widening loss were payments to content developers and administration fees connected with the run up to the IPO.

“Developer exchange fees track closely with our overall bookings performance as more users on the platform and Robux purchased by our users drives more Robux earned by developers and creators,” the company said in its filing.

Those fees soared 190% to $209.2 million in the first nine months of 2020 compared with the same period a year ago.

In the same period, general and administrative fees soared 125% to $64.9 million. While $27.7 million of that increase was due to higher personnel costs including stock-based compensation expenses, the company also cited “an increase in headcount in our finance, accounting, people, IT and legal functions associated with our anticipated public offering.”

5. Early investors get a big upper hand

The IPO is for Class A shares, which get one vote per share, as opposed to Class B shares that get 20 votes per share and are convertible to Class A shares.

Those Class B shares belong mostly to early investors, the first of which were Altos Ventures and First Round Capital. Altos has a 23.9% stake in the company with 114.3 million shares and First Round has a 7% stake with 33.6 million shares.

Later investors include Meritech Capital Partners and Index Ventures. Meritech owns an 11.6% stake at 55.3 million shares, while Index has an 11.1% stake at 53.1 million shares.

Tiger Global Management, which entered the picture in 2018, has an 8.2% stake at 39.3 million shares.

Earlier in the year, Andreessen Horowitz led a $150 million investment round in the company but doesn’t even break into the list of “greater than 5%” stockholders.

I was wondering what everyone's experience is with this. I don't have FOMO when I buy long-term stocks like AAPL, MSFT, etc. since I'm sure they'll still provide steady gains for years to come. However, I'm more iffy on other stocks that have reached their all time highs, as I worry that it won't produce much more than it has. Take ETSY for example. I planned on buying a share yesterday morning with my $200, since they were at about $183. Then I saw in the pre-market that it shot up to about $206. So I bought a share of Disney instead, since I'm more confident in them in the long-term. My question is, are most people confident in these growth stocks like ETSY to continue shooting up and constantly breaking their ATH? I'm still learning how to do all my proper research on companies and industries, but I don't see them turning into the next GOOG or AMZN or anything. As a result, it makes me feel like I wouldn't see as many gains with this stock. I don't have enough money to buy multiple shares, and I wouldn't want to buy one share of a company and only make about $50 when I could've bought more shares of a cheaper stock for more gains. It's not so much that I have FOMO with growth stocks, it's more like fear of not maximizing potential gains. Thoughts?",9,0.7

2021-02-28 00:01:35,How does Actively Managed ETF get money to buy stocks?,"I'm having trouble comprehending how Actively Managed ETFs work, with regards to getting money to make investment decisions. Did some sleuthing on Google, but none of the resources I found adequately explain the process. Appreciate the help!

Please correct my understanding if the following is out of touch with reality.

&#x200B;

For a passively managed ETF, I believe the following is accurate.

Let's say, for example, AWESOMEETF, a passive ETF. For simplicity, the fund currently only have 1 outstanding share, and holds the following securities:

 \- AAPL $100 - 1 share - 50% weight

 \- GOOG $10  - 10 shares - 50% weight

 Total Net Assets is $200

Net Asset Value of the fund found to be $200 / share

Starting Market Price of Fund is $200 / share

&#x200B;

Three scenarios:

1. If there is a buyer wanting 1 share, and the seller is willing to sell it to him, then the shares just exchanges hands. There's no change in the fund holdings.

&#x200B;

2. If there is a buyer wanting 1 share, and the seller is NOT willing to sell. That means the share would trade at a premium to the NAV, let's say $210. This is when the authorized participant (AP) steps in and creates a share by assembling a basket of AAPL/GOOG shares. He would purchase 1 share of AAPL, and 10 shares of GOOG, and deliver that to AWESOMEETF. AWESOMEETF in turn will issue 1 share of the fund. The AP spent $200 and sold the share to our buyer at $210.

 \- AAPL $100 - 2 share - 50% weight

 \- GOOG $10  - 20 shares - 50% weight

Total Net Assets is $400

Net Asset Value of the fund is $200 / share

&#x200B;

3. If our buyer had a change of heart and want to get rid of his 1 share, and we do not have any buyer willing to step in to take his share. That means the share would trade at a discount to the NAV, let's say $190. The AP would step in, buy the share from our paper handed person, redeem it against AWESOMEETF, and get 1 share of AAPL and 10 shares of GOOG. He can then sell at market price for $200, and make $10 from the transaction.

 \- AAPL $100 - 1 share - 50% weight

 \- GOOG $10  - 10 shares - 50% weight

Total Net Assets is $200

Net Asset Value of the fund is $200 / share

&#x200B;

I think I understand how fees are handled. Fees for the fund, such as management fee, trading costs, salary, and whatever, would be deducted from the Total Net Assets, and would thus reduce Market Price/share. This creates a discount of Market Price/share to NAV/share for the basket of stock. Thus, the trusty AP steps in again and redeem some fund shares for a basket of stock to bring Market the NAV / share back to Market Price/share.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Now, let's say AWESOMEETF is now an Actively Managed ETF.

1. What I do not grasp is how AWESOMEETF gets money to buy another stock. Since the AP only ever deliver and redeem shares, the portfolio manager never sees cash. Does that mean if the portfolio manager wants to buy some FB, then the only way to get the funds would be by selling a portion of AAPL or AME?

&#x200B;

2. If let's say that is indeed the case. If the portfolio manager sells 5 shares of GOOG to buy 1 share of FB. Our fund breakdown would be:

 \- AAPL  $100 - 1 share  - 50% weight

 \- GOOG  $10  - 5 shares - 25% weight

 \- FB $20  - 1 share  - 10% weight

 \- cash $30             - 15% weight

Ignoring transaction costs, the Total Net Assets is still $200

Net Asset Value of the fund is $200 / share

&#x200B;

When the AP need to deliver a basket of shares for AWESOMEETF share creation, does he need to deliver cash as part of the basket?

&#x200B;

3. Since Actively Managed ETFs are only required to disclose their transactions at the end of the day, how does AP know which stocks are part of the basket?",0,0.36

2020-10-30 13:08:07,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, October 30, 2020. What a crazy day, hope this helps a bit :)","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 30, 2020**

The stock market fell sharply today, erasing yesterday’s gains to close out one of the worst weeks and worst month since March. Volatility has dominated markets in the last few weeks, with investors spooked by the uncertainty of the US presidential elections, a record number of coronavirus infections in the US and Europe, and a new wave of lockdowns across Europe.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) performed the worst, ended the day 2.54% down, the S&P 500 (SPY) ended the day 1% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) 0.52% down.

Yesterday after-hours, heavily-weighted tech companies, like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Facebook (FB) reported their quarterly earnings. Though most reported third-quarter results that exceeded expectations, shares of these companies (except Alphabet) pulled back steeply today. After the strong performance of these stocks compared to the broader market this year, market participants had set their expectations exceptionally high. In other words, traders expected these companies to beat expectations by a much greater margin than they did. The earnings results for all these companies can be found in yesterday’s issue of the daily recap. 

Today, the Federal Reserve announced it lowered the minimum loan size for its Main Street lending program to $100,000 from $250,000 and that “fees have been adjusted to encourage the provision of these smaller loans”. Demand for the lending program has been weak thus far, with the Fed having offered just 400 loans totaling $3.7 billion, out of the total $600 billion capacity. As many pundits have pointed out, many small- and mid-sized businesses have stayed on the sidelines from taking on more loans that they would eventually need to pay back during the pandemic.

Unfortunately, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, there were 88,521 new coronavirus infections reported in the US yesterday, another record, and 9,540 more cases than were reported Wednesday. The trend this week is worrying, given that only last Friday, the US set its previous record for daily new infections. According to the Washington Post, The total number of infections reported nationwide since February is virtually guaranteed to reach 9 million on Friday, just 15 days after the tally hit 8 million. At least 228,000 deaths have been linked to the coronavirus in the country.

Europe is in the thralls of a second surge in coronavirus, with the continent now accounting for 46% of global cases and nearly a third of total deaths. According to World Health Organization (WHO) Spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris, compared to last week, daily cases in Europe have risen by “about a third” and daily deaths by “close to 40%” this week. This month, both France and Spain have declared states of emergency, imposing more restrictions to try to ease up pressure on hospital ICU departments. In France, the worst-hit country, more than half of ICU beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, according to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.

Today is the last Friday before the US presidential election on Tuesday. Regardless of political leanings, the results of this election are sure to have a massive effect on the stock market, it’ll be interesting to see how markets react to whatever the US decides.

Unfortunately, over the weekend, the US posted consecutive days of record high infection, with more than 80,000 new cases confirmed on Friday and Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. States in the Midwest of the US have been the most affected, most likely due to a resistance by the population to wear masks and colder temperatures.. Over the past seven days, the country reported an average of about 68,767 new cases every day, the highest seven-day average recorded yet, again according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Worryingly, The seven-day average is up more than 22% compared to last week, an extremely worrying increase. Adjusted for population, the Dakotas, Wisconsin, Montana and Idaho are reporting more average daily new cases than anywhere else in the country. Sadly, Johns Hopkins University reported there were 225,111 COVID-19 related deaths across the country as of Sunday afternoon. By comparison, there were 291,557 American soldiers killed in battle during World War II, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

Europe is faring no better, with countries reporting a record number of infections over the weekend and announcing a host of new restrictions. On Sunday, France reported 52,000 positive cases, a record for the country. In response, two-thirds of the country has been placed under strict, 9 p.m. curfew. In Italy, 15,199 new cases of the virus were reported, well above the previous record of 11,705. In response, the Italian government has implemented restrictions, shutting down gyms, pools and movie theaters, putting an early curfew on cafes and restaurants and mandating that people keep wearing masks outdoors. Spain, which has also been struggling with a record number of infections, declared a nationwide state of emergency and imposed a curfew. 

With the November election a mere 8 days away, the chances for the passage of additional virus-relief have all but disappeared. In a letter to her fellow Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slammed the Republicans for the failure to act in the face of the pandemic, calling their response “arrogance”. She said, “The Republicans’ continued surrender to the virus - particularly amid the recent wave cases - is official malfeasance. We must come to an agreement as soon as possible. But we cannot accept the \[Trump\] administration’s refusal to crush the virus, honor our heroes or put money in the pockets of the American people. That attitude clearly explains why the White House has not embraced the science-based path to crush the virus, which is contained in the Heroes Act.” Democrats and the White House have most recently proposed $2.2 trillion and $1.9 trillion relief packages, respectively. Despite the similar target price tags for legislation, the sides still have not resolved disputes over testing, extra unemployment insurance, state and local government relief and liability protections for businesses, among other issues.

And how this is going to be a trillion $$ sector on its own. How stupid is that? Do people not know Waymo, Zoox exists? They already have working services in west coast and we hardly hear about them. So I am trying to understand how Robo taxi and autonomous helps tsla justify this valuation but doesn't help GOOG and AMZN at all. Because they can actually vertically integrate these services into their business. Imagine Booking a waymo ride from Google Maps which is already installed on like BILLIONS of devices? same with Zoox, they can integrate it with Amazon Prime membership

TL;DR

Don't buy into the TSLA cult when they try to sell you on autonomous and robo taxi. There are other tech companies like NVDA, AMZN and GOOG already ahead of the game with vertical integration in their products",1,1.0
2020-11-02 13:05:18,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, November 2, 2020. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 2, 2020**

Stocks opened today’s session higher before paring some gains ahead of an extremely busy week, with market participants closely monitoring the results of the US presidential election, a meeting of the Federal Reserve, and the October jobs report, and rising coronavirus numbers in the US and Europe.

After an extremely choppy day, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.22% up, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 1.11% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the best, finishing 1.56% up.

On Tuesday is the US presidential election between incumbent Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. Needless to say, given the political divide, the coronavirus pandemic, and social unrest that exists in the United States right now, the outcome of this election will be extremely significant. According to a study done by Edward Jones, since 1932, the stock market has dipped 64% percent of the time the day after a presidential election. This likely reflects anxiety about the future if a large cohort of the population is unhappy with the election result. Regardless of the election result,  it's likely a large section of the population will be unhappy. Moreover, given the surge of early and mail-in ballots due to the pandemic, the possibility exists that the outcome may not be clear after Tuesday. This scenario would certainly cause a massive spike in volatility and uncertainty in the markets. According to the US Elections Project at the University of Florida, as of Friday of last week, around 85 million individuals have cast their ballots, over half of the total turnout in 2016. If this pace picks up, this election could have the highest voter participation rate in over 100 years.

Regardless of the outcome, the election will have a number of consequences for Corporate America. For example, a change in the political control in either the Senate or the White House (which are Republican-controlled right now) could potentially alter corporate tax rates, increase or decrease regulation in some industries, affect trade relations with other countries, and changes in capital gains tax, which is important for market participants. Moreover, the outcome of the election will likely influence the timing and size of much-needed additional fiscal stimulus 

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is set to hold the first of its two-day rate-setting meeting the day after Election Day, with the twelve FOMC meeting Wednesday and monetary policy statement and press conference from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday. Going off previous meetings, the Fed is virtually guaranteed to keep interest rates, near zero. After their last meeting in September, the Fed signaled that it would maintain interest rates are current levels until “at least 2023”. Throughout these meetings, FOMC members, including Powell, have increasingly escalated their calls for further fiscal stimulus to complement the Fed’s monetary support. In early October, Powell said, “too little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardships for households and businesses.”

On Friday, the Department of Labor is set to release the October job report, a crucial piece of data to understand the state of the labor market and gauge the pace of recovery. According to Bloomberg consensus data, non-farm payrolls are expected to increase by around 600,000. While this estimate would the sixth month of net payroll gains, it would also be the four, straight month of deceleration, indicating the pace of recovery is slowing. The unemployment rate is also predicted to tick lower, from 7.9% to 7.6%. However, worryingly, there appears to be a trend towards long-term unemployment for many Americans. The number of individuals filing continuing claims, people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim, has continued to increase the past several weeks. This means that people who lost their job due to the pandemic are having an increasing harder time finding new employment quickly.

The US just set a new record for the highest seven-day average of daily new cases: 81,336 as of Sunday. That's the first time the number has ever topped 80,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. new cases are far exceeding new testing. Over the past week, new cases have increased 18%, according to Johns Hopkins. But the number of new tests performed has increased only 4.29%, according to the Covid Tracking Project. 

Last week, Europe recorded around 1.5 million new cases of coronavirus, a new record, according to data from Johns Hopkins. Trends are worrying across the continent now, including in countries such as Greece and the Czech Republic, where infection rates had been low until recently. Measures are tightening up everywhere. England, in response to the surge, announced a nationwide lockdown for at least the next four weeks.

**Highlights**

* Apple (AAPL) announced on Monday an event for Nov. 10 where it’s expected to announce new Macs that are powered by their own chips powered by ARM processors, instead of the Intel chips it had been using. Could impact Nvidia (NVDA) stock, which owns ARM chips, and Intel, who has not been doing very well lately, judging from last earnings report and stock price action (INTC).
* Images for the updated Tesla Cybertruck could come next Musk, according to CEO Elon Musk.
* Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO announced its October deliveries, and the number has shares on the move, again. NIO delivered 5,055 vehicles in October, doubling from a year ago. The result is doubly impressive because NIO very recently raised its manufacturing capacity to 5,000 vehicles a month. The company is selling all the cars it can make. This stock is an absolute monster and is one we love at PsychoTrader!
* Alibaba (BABA), is doubling its Singles’ Day offerings this year, running the massive online sales event across two periods rather than one. Alibaba says it expanded the shopping window for Singles’ Day to provide more relief for merchants that have been hit hard by the pandemic. Single’s day is a counter to Valentine’s Day that celebrates being single. Normally it’s held on Nov 11. This is the world’s largest shopping festival. According to Fortune Magazine, BABA shipped $38.4 billion in gross merchandise value on Singles’ Day last year. Amazon’s Prime Day, by comparison, sold around $6 billion in goods last year.

Stocks traded higher today, with market participants hoping that lawmakers may succeed in coming to an agreement for more stimulus in the near-term. 

Stocks lost some momentum in the last hour of market, but still ended the day higher overall. The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.21%, the S&P (SPY) finished 0.38% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) ended the day 0.35% up.

Over the weekend, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi set a deadline for today to reach a deal with the Trump administration for an additional round of stimulus before the November election. However, in an interview today, Pelosi downplayed the importance of the deadline she had set, signaling that she is willing to keep talks going. “It isn’t that this day was a day that we would have a deal, it was a day that we would have our terms on the table to be able to go to the next step. Hopefully by the end of the day today, we’ll know where we stand.” In other words, if a bill is to be voted on and passed before the November election, terms need to be agreed and the bill written soon.  Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama responded saying, “You never know what's going to happen around here at the last minute but it's getting to be toward the last minute and the clock keeps ticking away. I’m not optimistic about doing anything.”

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Pelosi are set to continue discussion regarding stimulus today at 3 p.m. easter time, as both officials make a push to come to an agreement very soon. Discussions between the pair have been ongoing for weeks but unfortunately very little progress seems to be made, grappling with disagreements on issues including state and local funding and liability protection, per the Wall Street Journal. Let’s hope they are able to come to a decision. 

Pres. Trump also supported the idea of a large, comprehensive stimulus package  saying “I want to do it even bigger than the Democrats. Not every Republican agrees, but they will. I want to do it even bigger, because this is money going to people who did not deserve what happened to them.""

**Highlights**

* The US Justice Department filed an anti-trust lawsuit against Google (GOOG) alleging that the company has unlawfully suppressed competition to maintain a monopoly in search engines by cutting off rivals from key distribution channels. Despite this, the stock was 1.79% up at the time of writing.
* Ford Motor (F) plans to launch its self-driving commercial business in 2022 with vehicles based on the Ford Escape Hybrid crossover, the company said Tuesday. The vehicles are the automaker’s fourth-generation self-driving test vehicles in partnership with Argo AI, a Pittsburgh-based autonomous vehicle start-up. 
* Oil futures shook off early losses Tuesday to log their first gain in four sessions, lifting U.S. benchmark prices to their highest finish in almost seven weeks.     
* General Motors (GM) shares were rallying Tuesday ahead of the company’s highly anticipated debut of its fully electric Hummer truck.     
* Intel (INTC) plans to sell its flash-memory, or NAND, business to Korean chip maker SK Hynix Inc for $9 billion.     
* Microsoft (MSFT) is partnering with Elon Musk’s SpaceX’s it expands its cloud-computing platform into space, MSFT said on Tuesday. The partnership would allow Microsoft to connect its Azure cloud computing platform to SpaceX's network of low-Earth orbiting satellites. “The collaboration that we’re announcing today will allow us to work together to deliver new offerings for both the public and the private sector to deliver connectivity through Starlink for use on Azure” said SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell.
* Azure Power (AZRE) had a price target raised by Credit Suisse from $23 to $30 at OUTPERFORM

* Andrew Strelzik upgraded Dave & Buster's (PLAY) from Market Perform to Outperform with a price target lifted from $17 to $26 on reports that the company plans on raising $500 million in a junk bond sale and this removes a key overhang around the stock. 
* Alibaba (BABA) and Swiss-based travel retailer Dufry disclosed plans to form a joint venture earlier this month to develop the business in China. BABA is taking a stake of 6.1% in Dufry AG as part of a roughly $900 million capital increase.

2020-06-30 14:42:56,"1,5 Years Since My Journey Began, $52 591 dollars wealthier & only 18 months left.","*Introduction*

I'm 20 years old and my interest for the stock market began at age 16 which later grew into becoming my lovely addiction and before graduating high school i already had a detailed plan on how i would become financial independent and self employed as quick as possible, the first milestone to reach before continuing my dreams are to reach an entire net worth of $100 000 dollars.

In the beginning of setting the $100 000 dollar goal i started with $13 953 dollars and today 1,5 years later i have a total net worth of $66 544 dollars which basically means i only have 33,45% left of the goal to complete within 18 months which is entirely possible. It felt so much harder in the beginning but hard work pays off. While creating the plan i expected to have $52 730 dollars this month of the year but from making better decisions, working hard and presumably a little touch of luck i'm 5 months ahead.

I maximized the overtime-limit at my workplace last year which is roughly 200 hours per year, i managed to reach 212h, sadly the overtime is cancelled due to covid-19 but currently i have 24h 36m in overtime. I've driven taxi *(illegally which i stopped doing)*, been cutting lawns an lending out money in order to speed up the process of my journey.

I've cut almost all unnecessary expenses, i don't travel, i rarely drink alcohol, still driving around in my $1 000 dollar car watching others laugh at me but don't get me wrong, i enjoy traveling and eventfully i'm going to buy myself a new car, i don't want to create wealth just to stare at it. This is something i been planning for a very long time and that i'm fully committed to. It's psychologically frustrating but in the end it's definitely going to be worth it.

*Portfolio distribution*

* *Funds: 8,27% ($5 503)*
* *Ready assets:* 55,93% ($37 218)
* *Stocks:* ATVI, AAPL, **AZN**, BAC, **CAST**, DAL, MSFT, **HUFV A**, **KIND SDB**, NFLX, NVDA, **SWED A**, UBER
* *Funds:* **Avanza Auto 6, Avanza USA, Spiltan Aktiefond Investmentbolag**

note: *The Tickers with bold fonts are swedish stocks/funds which may not be available in your country.*

I sold a majority of my shares in the beginning of 2020 expecting a recession or correction but instead we got covid-19 which was extremely unpredictable so i was really lucky that i already had a pretty high amount in liquidity. So far i've been taking advantage of the pandemic by investing in stocks that i hopefully believe will recover. I also did some Q1 report trading which made me about $3 000 dollars profit, i traded CAST, GOOG, TWTR and I'm constantly looking for opportunities.

I'm expected to be fully invested within 1 year and i'm not stressed by having 55,93% liquidity since the inflation is 0. The *""fear of missing out""* is also nothing that's bothering me, everything can happen, especially now.

*Income, expenses & conditions*

My monthly income varies depending on how much i work but i averaged $3 008 dollars after taxes during 2019, i invest everything except $500 dollars and the reason how i can invest 83,37% of my monthly income is because i still live at home. The only reason why i still live at home is so i can take advantage of the opportunity to invest and build myself a foundation.

*The Missing piece*

What i'm missing is friends and connections with this interest in common, i rarely have anyone to talk with when it comes to investments and such so i really hope that i can reach out to some of you. If you're interested just send me a message, thanks for reading and if you have any questions i'll be happy to answer.",1832,0.93

2020-10-28 18:07:12,"Pinterest’s pandemic surge continues, stock jumps more than 25% toward fresh record highs","Pinterest thrashes earnings estimates while adding another 26 million active users, stock again heads for big gains after earnings and pushes Twitter and Facebook shares higher too.

Pinterest Inc. continued to experience a surge in new users during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to larger-than-expected profit and revenue growth this summer, according to a Wednesday earnings report that sent shares on another ride toward fresh record highs.

Pinterest PINS reported a third-quarter loss of $94.2 million, or 16 cents a share, on revenue of $442.6 million, up from $280 million a year ago. After adjusting for stock-based compensation and other factors, the company reported earnings of 13 cents a share, up from adjusted earnings of a penny a share a year ago. Analysts on average expected adjusted earnings of 4 cents a share on sales of $383 million.

Pinterest shares jumped more than 25% in after-hours trading following the report, after closing with a 7.1% decline at $48.78. Shares were topping $63 in the extended session after closing with a 6.2% decline at $49.25; Pinterest shares have never traded for higher than $53.87 in regular trading.

Pinterest shares have more than doubled to record highs since the social-media company’s last earnings report, which predicted much higher revenue and user growth than previously expected. The online-advertising market seems to have found strength despite the pandemic, as strong third-quarter financial results last week from Snap Inc. SNAP sent stocks in ad-supported online companies higher across the board.

Online-ad stocks also experienced a jump after Pinterest’s report, which arrived 24 hours ahead of quarterly reports from online-ad powerhouses Facebook Inc. FB , Alphabet Inc. GOOGL GOOG and Twitter Inc. TWTR . Twitter shares gained more than 5% in the extended session Wednesday, while Facebook stock increased more than 2% and Google parent Alphabet added about 1%.

Pinterest executives said they expect revenue to grow around 60% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, roughly in line with the 58% growth in the third quarter. Pinterest reported revenue of $400 million in last year’s holiday period, so the guidance suggests sales of about $640 million this year, which again trounces expectations. Analysts on average predicted fourth-quarter revenue of $541 million, according to FactSet.

Pinterest stock has gained 165% so far this year, and more than 106% in the past three months, as the S&P 500 SPX index has gained 5% and 5.4% in those periods.

Stocks jumped higher in the first session of October before losing strength throughout the session, buoyed by hope that lawmakers will provide more stimulus before the November election and slightly better than expected unemployment numbers. 

The three major indices closed out the month of September red, falling an average of 4% for the first monthly loss since March. The major benchmarks posted their worst September performance since 2011, according to Yahoo Finance. But zooming out to include trading from July and August, equities’ third-quarter performance held up much more strongly. The S&P 500 posted its best third-quarter advance since 2010 with a rise of 8.5%, per Bloomberg.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) ended the day 1.59% up, the S&P (SPY) finished 0.62% up, and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.22% in another volatile session.

It seems traders are expecting September’s volatility to carry into October, with political uncertainty surrounding the presidential election at the top of their mind, especially after the, shall we say, contentious debate. Hopes for additional, much-needed stimulus dimmed after in-person talks between Pelosi, Mnuchin, and Congressional lawmakers did not produce an agreement. While the pair said they made progress and had further discussions planned, many are skeptical any kind of deal will be reached before the election in November.

For the many, the economic situation at the hands of the pandemic remains dire, with a slew of job cuts being announced. Airlines American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) are moving forward with a collective 32,000 job cuts after contingencies tied to federal coronavirus relief aid they received earlier this year expired on Wednesday. Disney (DIS) said it would be cutting 28,000 workers across its resort business. Insurance giant Allstate (ALL) announced an 8% reduction in its workforce, impacting some 3,800 jobs. Goldman Sachs (GS) is also reportedly looking to cut about 400 jobs, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, and the oil major Shell (RDS) announced plans to cut up to 9,000 jobs.

The labor report released this week will not capture these planned layoffs, those will most likely be reflected in next weeks’ report. The Labor Department reported that another 837,000 people filed for first-time unemployment insurance. While this is below the 850,000 estimate and an improvement on last week's number, it is clear that the labor market is still struggling during the pandemic and needs Congressional assistance to get back on track.  Tomorrow September’s monthly jobs report will be released. Analysts expect a fifth straight month of payroll gains and 868,000 jobs to have come back. However, after the announcement of massive job cuts this week, we’ll have to see if analysts revise their estimates.

I'd like some thoughts/advice on the stocks I'm currently holding, most of these stocks I'll be moving to my new brokerage account. 

My plan for 2021 is to continue putting money into stocks I already own and after some time get rid of whatever few stocks that aren't doing too well, or just holding them. I also plan to invest in a few more ETF's but since they're a bit pricey rn I'm not sure which ones to invest in.

Losses in the stock market accelerated today as market participants nervously eyed rising coronavirus case counts in the US and Europe, the presidential election a mere 6 days away, and developments out of Washington regarding stimulus.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) slid 3.90$ down, the S&P 500 (SPY) fell 3.41%, and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 3.35%.

In the United States, there were 73,240 coronavirus cases reported yesterday, according to Johns Hopkins University. Alarmingly, the average number of daily new cases in the US rose  21% compared to the previous week. According to an article from CNN Health, the surge is hitting all parts of the country, with 40 states reporting at least a 10% increase in daily average cases, compared to last week. Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University School of Public Health, said, “Cases are rising quickly. If we go back about six, seven weeks ago to Labor Day, we \[the United States\] were at about 35,000 cases a day.”  U.S. hospitalizations related to COVID-19 have risen by at least 10% over the past week across 32 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One good thing is the FDA approval of remdesivir, a therapeutic developed by Gildead (GILD) that was used to treat the president.

In Europe, the average number of daily cases rose by 33% compared to last week, accounting for the greatest proportion of new cases in the world, according to data compiled from worldometer.info. France is the hardest hit country in Europe. On Tuesday, it reported more than 33,400 new cases and 523 coronavirus deaths in 24 hours, as well as a net increase of 74 admissions to intensive care, bringing the total  to 2,918, over half the country's overall capacity of 5,800. French President Emmanuel Macron announced nationwide restrictions for the next four weeks. Germany joined France, imposing its own four-week nationwide lockwide, which includes curfew and restrictions on businesses like gyms, bars, restaurants, hairdressers etc.

Yesterday, President Trump publicly acknowledged that an agreement on additional stimulus would not happen until after the election. While he signaled that his administration was still willing to negotiate, with the election a mere 6 days away, the chances of stimulus passing before then are practically zero.

Prospects for further fiscal stimulus coming from Congress has been a main point of interest for traders since the CARES Act, the first round of stimulus passed in March, ran out on July 31. Though prospects for additional passage before the November election are slim, recent reports of a $1.8 trillion proposal coming from the White House and renewed talks between Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Last week’s meetings between the pair did not produce an agreement, both parties are optimistic that a deal will  be worked out. In an interview with CNN, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow offered an upbeat assessment of the negotiations, saying that “the bid and offer is narrowing somewhat between the two sides.” While there is a large delta between both proposals, the fact that the White House is showing a willingness to negotiate and compromise is a good sign that negotiations are going forward in good faith. 

Third-quarter earnings begin in earnest this week. A host of big banks, including JP Morgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C), will report earnings tomorrow. Big banks, which have underperformed the broader market since the March bottom, will provide valuable information into the extent of the ongoing strain to the US economy as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. 

For this earnings season, analysts expect companies to report more year-on-year declines in profits due to business difficulties arising from the pandemic. According to data collected by FactSet, consensus estimates predict a earnings per share decline of 20.5% over the last year for companies in the S&P 500. This earnings season comes at a very interesting time, with the market primed for several market-moving events, including the possibility of vaccine and therapeutic breakthroughs to treat coronavirus and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming presidential election. According to analysts at Goldman Sachs (GS), “New information on the election, vaccines, and upcoming 3Q earnings represent substantial cross-currents for equities during the next two months. However, the vaccine represents a more important factor than the election result for the recovery in S&P 500 fundamentals. In short, the progress of the US economy depends more on developments surrounding the disease rather than political elections or candidate differences in restoring the broken fundamentals of the stock market.

Stocks traded choppily after yesterday’s selloff, with the indices losing an average of 5% from their October highs. Market participants are closely monitoring the rising number of coronavirus cases in the US and Europe and uncertainty surrounding stimulus and the presidential election a mere week away.

In the US, over the weekend, the US registered coronavirus cases hit a record high with more than 81,000 new cases, according to data gathered from worldometers.info. Yesterday, the US registered 70,000 new cases. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert said the US is still in the “first wave” of the pandemic, given that cases never stabilized to more than a “manageable level.” He explained that while the Northeast has been able to reduce its outbreak, the national baseline never fell to a more manageable number like 10,000 cases per day.

With a worrying surge of cases across Europe, governments have begun imposing a new round of restrictions. Today, the Czech Republic joined France, Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom in enforcing a strict nighttime curfew and placing new restrictions in businesses such as gyms and restaurants. 

Yesterday, Speaker Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin met for what feels like the hundredth time to discuss the passage of additional stimulus. Pelosi’s spokesperson Drew Hamill said of the meeting, “The Speaker remains optimistic that an agreement can be reached before the election,” adding that “progress depends on Leader Mitch McConnell.” Today, Senators left Washington for a break ahead of the election. With the election a mere week away and Senators no longer in Washington, chances to pass a bill are extremely thin. 

Next Tuesday, November 3rd are the US presidential elections between Joe Biden (D) and President Trump (R). The election is set to be extremely contentious and will have enormous effect on the market for years to come.

Stocks dropped again today, closing out a volatile week on a sour note. Tech stocks continued pulling back, with many notable stocks breaking through well-established supports. In spite of the Fed’s commitment to keep interest rates low until 2023 and mostly positive economic data, the sell off in tech, which is the largest holding in the three major benchmarks, has dragged the market down. 

This week, tech stocks like Apple (AMZN), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) have declined sharply after hitting consecutive record highs in August. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is the hardest hit, with prices at similar levels to early August. The S&P finished the day 1.12% down, the Nasdaq 1.28% down, the Dow was 0.87% down.

After a historic August led by tech stocks, the current volatility in the market has sharply lowered investor sentiment and belief in the prospect of a sharp recovery for the virus-ravaged economy.The still raging pandemic, combined with no fiscal stimulus from Congress, has economists lowering expectations for the remainder of the year. In a note to clients today, Goldman Sachs (GS) said, “At this point, a major stimulus package before the election looks like a long shot and we expect Congress to leave at the end of September without extending the extra unemployment insurance payment, approving another round of stimulus payments, or providing additional support to small businesses or state and local governments. Failure to pass any additional fiscal measures would likely lead us to downgrade our growth estimates for Q4”

Economic data has been surprisingly good in spite of the circumstances. 860,000 people filed unemployment claims, while that’s a lot normally, it has been less than 1 million for the third week straight. Continuing Claims, which are the number of people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim, fell below 13 million for the first time since March highs, an encouraging sign. 

Confidence in the market, right now, is dependent on Congress passing more fiscal stimulus. Top FOMC officials, including Jerome Powell, and Pres. Trump have publicly endorsed the passage of more fiscal stimulus. Economists and politicians agree that more stimulus is needed to boost consumer confidence and provide much-needed support to cash-strapped families and small businesses.

Stocks rose today, reversing course after being deep in the red the last two days. Market participants digested a record increase in third-quarter GDP for the US, a better-than-expected weekly unemployment report, new coronavirus restrictions in the US and Europe and a slew of corporate earnings for massive companies.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 1.75% today, the best performing of the major indices. The S&P 500 (SPY) finished 1.05% up and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.44%.

After coming off one of the worst quarters in US history, the economy rebounded, growing at its fastest pace ever. Gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of the total goods and services produced from July to September of this year, expanded at a 33.1% annualized pace, according to the report by the Department of Commerce. The gain came after a 31.4% plunge in the second quarter and was better than the 32% estimate from economists surveyed by Dow Jones. The previous record was the post-World War II 16.7% surge in the first quarter of 1950.

Today, the US Department of Commerce released its weekly unemployment report, showing that another 751,000 individuals filed initial jobless claims, better than the 770,000 estimated by analysts.  Continuing claims, which refer to individuals that are currently receiving unemployment benefits who filed for unemployment benefits at least two weeks ago, was 7.75 million, slightly better than the 7.77 million expected. According to Yahoo Finance, this report represents the ninth-straight week initial unemployment claims have remained below 1 million and continuing claims below 10 million, a key indicator that the economy is recovering, though not as fast as many would like.

In Europe, countries are still struggling to contain the recent surge in coronavirus infections. Both France and Germany announced renewed lockdowns spanning for about the next month, though the restrictions stopped short of the draconian measures announced earlier on during the pandemic. In the US, the seven-day average of daily new cases rose to a record 70,000 as of yesterday, according to data compiled by the Washington Post.

On the vaccine front, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, said he believed it would take until at least January for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to authorize a COVID-19 vaccine. There are five companies (Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Moderna (MRNA), Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (ELY), and BioNTech (BNTX)) in the final stages of study for a coronavirus vaccine, with Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. having fully enrolled their trials, Fauci said.

Some analysts consider the recent pull-back in the stock market a healthy inevitability, given the strong rally that took many stocks to all-time highs earlier in the Month. Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, said in a note to clients, “Markets have been baking in a lot of optimism: that the pandemic was under control, that the economy was healing, and that things would be back to something approaching normal in 2021. Those assumptions were always optimistic, though, and what we are seeing now is a reality-based repricing. As such, this drop is both necessary and healthy. Markets should reflect the most likely future path, not the most optimistic, and that is where we are headed.”

2020-09-23 13:25:17,"Here is a Market Recap for today, Sept 23. What a crazy day!","PsychoMarket Recap - September 23, 2020

Stocks turned sharply negative again, erasing yesterday’s gains and continuing the decline from the earlier week as investors weighed slowing economic data and the absence of fiscal stimulus. This was one of the worst sessions in September. The SPY finished 2.35% down, the Nasdaq 3.05% down and the Dow finished 1.93% down. 

Tech shares reversed yesterday’s course and sank, leading the broader market down. Big tech stocks, like Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG) finished around 2% down on average. 

Economic analysts were mostly bearish. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note, “It’s also pretty clear that the rates of recovery have slowed, with only retail sales having completed the V. You can thank the enhanced unemployment benefits for that – $600 per week for more than 30M people, at the peak. It’s hard to be optimistic about September and the fourth quarter, with the chance of a further relief bill before the election receding as Washington focuses on the Supreme Court”.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin once again addressed the urgent need for further stimulus in a testimony before the House Financial Services Committee yesterday. Powell underscored the limitations of the Federal Reserve’s lending powers. He said, “Many borrowers will benefit from these programs, as will the overall economy. But for others, a loan that could be difficult to repay might not be the answer. In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed.” Mnuchin added that he wanted to reauthorize measures under the Payment Protection Program (PPP) that offered forgivable loans to businesses that stayed open and kept most of their employees on payroll. Unfortunately, any reauthorization or reallocation of funds requires Congressional approval, something unlikely to happen with lawmakers unable to come to a consensus about stimulus and focused mainly on the Supreme Court.

**Highlights**

* Yesterday was Tesla’s (TSLA) battery day. The company laid out plans to $25,000 car and cut battery costs in half over the next three years. However, this fell short of expectations of investors and analysts, who said “while the technology and manufacturing innovations outlined were impressive, Tesla’s valuation already priced in these disruptors”. The stock finished the day 10.34% down. 
* SPI Energy (SPI) rocketed today after the company announced they were launching a new electric vehicle subsidiary. Stock was up 3000% at one point before finishing the day 1,199% up. 
* Nike (NKE) shares spiked up today after the company’s earning announcement based on increased ecommerce sales. The stock finished the day 8.77% up.

   * Revenue of $443.4 million vs $414.52 estimate

2015-08-06 09:46:34,A Detailed Look At $GOOG,"Google (NASDAQ:[GOOG](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GOOG)) ([GOOGL](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GOOGL)) continued its strong performance in the [second quarter](investor.google.com/earnings/2015/Q2_google_earnings.html) of 2015. Highlights in the period included double-digit growth in revenues, cash flows, and earnings. The firm has tremendous flexibility, as it boasts over $70 billion in cash and has only ~$5 billion in debt. We think the company is gearing up for potential buybacks, which we would view as value-creating (in light of its price-fair-value-ratio), or even a dividend, arguably following in Apple's ([AAPL](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AAPL)) footsteps. Perhaps more exciting is that the company is focusing its efforts on cost management, which means economic returns are looking to rise..

Though revenue has been growing consistently, that growth has come under pressure, but more due to the law of large numbers than anything else. In 2014, revenue increased 19% year-over-year, down from 21% in 2013, and down from 22% in 2012, but as the company's revenue base grows, an accelerating pace of revenue expansion becomes more difficult. Constant-currency revenue growth was 18% in the second quarter, and many firms would give anything for that pace of expansion.

The best may still be ahead for Google. According to the second-quarter [earnings call transcript](seekingalpha.com/article/3332585-googles-goog-management-discusses-on-q2-2015-results-earnings-call-transcript?page=2), YouTube watch time rose more than 60% on a year-over-year basis in the quarter, its fastest growth rate in two years! What's more impressive is the jump in mobile activity. Mobile watch time on YouTube more than doubled from the prior year's period, a positive sign as the Internet becomes increasingly mobile focused. Also, the number of advertisers on YouTube rose over 40% year-over-year and the average spend per advertiser is up 60% year-over-year, supplementing the 11% growth in Google's advertising revenue.

It's probably not surprising Google's stock price has reached 52-week highs following the release of the firm's second quarter earnings. We've been pounding the table on shares (see [here](seekingalpha.com/article/2520865-why-google-has-upside-to-800-plus-per-share), [here](seekingalpha.com/article/2326125-google-one-of-the-best-values-in-this-overheated-market), [here](seekingalpha.com/article/2165243-why-google-has-upside-to-nearly-650), [here](seekingalpha.com/article/1923781-why-google-continues-to-have-significant-upside)). What was our differentiated insight? A rigorous focus on the free cash flow and the balance sheet. Though many investors like to dismiss valuation, and we respect that, if performed correctly, it can uncover some of the best insights out there. Let's take a look at Google's other investment considerations and derive our fair value estimate for shares.

**Investment Highlights**

• Once known exclusively for its search dominance, which it maintains, Google has become a tech company focused on a number of things: social, Android, ads, YouTube, Chrome, and research. We think the company will have some megahits in the years ahead, and shares are worth well over $600 each.

• Google is a holding in the portfolio of the Best Ideas Newsletter. We like its valuation, growth potential, cash-flow generation and competitive profile. Very few firms are more attractive on a fundamental basis.

• Google continues to grow revenue at a healthy pace. The firm is pleased with the momentum it is seeing from its mobile division, particularly within mobile advertising. The mobile Internet space will be key for the company moving forward, but Facebook and Twitter are not backing down.

• Google has a strong future in search-both on the desktop and via mobile devices. The company recently sold Motorola Mobility, a value-creating move as it can now allocate more capital to high-return opportunities or new concepts such as self-driving cars, Glass, Fiber, or other innovative ideas.

• Google has three different stock classes with two different tickers. GOOG represents Class A stock, and GOOGL represents the non-voting Class C stock that was created by a stock split in 2014 in order for Google founders to maintain majority control.

**Economic Profit Analysis**

From our point of view, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Google's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 61.6%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 11.7%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT.

**Cash Flow Analysis**

Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Google's free cash flow margin has averaged about 20.1% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG.

The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Google, cash flow from operations increased about 34% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 235% over the same time period.

In the second quarter of 2015, Google reported cash from operations of ~$7 billion and capital expenditures of ~$2.5 billion, resulting in free cash flow of ~$4.5 billion in the quarter.

**Valuation Analysis**

This is the section you've been searching for, the culmination of our analysis. Below we outline our valuation assumptions and derive a fair value estimate for shares. Our discounted cash flow model indicates that Google's shares are worth between $543-$815 each. Our next modeling update will likely result in a fair value revision closer to $800 per share in light of the firm's quarterly results. A fair value range is paramount to an assessment in valuation, and why we were able to make the call on Google's undervalued shares.

At present, our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 16% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 9.6%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 28.8%, which is above Google's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 5.4% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Google, we use a 11.7% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows. Follow us for our next update.

Wrapping Things Up

We think Google is a fantastic company.

We've been big fans for some time now, and we love the company's renewed focus on expense management. Its growth potential is not going away anytime soon, and the firm will continue to be a Internet powerhouse as consumers shift to a increasingly more mobile-based Internet.

As the power of the Internet expands, Google with have its hand in the growth. Ongoing innovation should create a suite of products in the future that are even more advanced that those on the present horizon. What those products might be offers a unique case of upside potential, a dynamic that few companies truly have. Google is on the right track.

The company has been one of the best performers in the Best Ideas Newsletter portfolio. Google currently registers a 4 on the Valuentum Buying Index.

2020-11-06 09:53:48,Trying to get a handle on valuations and target prices,"One of the things I've been focusing more on as I become a more experienced investor is understanding valuations and identifying target prices for stocks I want.  As I described in my recent thread about sitting on the sidelines this week, I had raised some cash for an impending market drop and developed a shopping list of stocks I wanted.  I missed good buying opportunities because the market rebounded so sharply and none of my stocks came anywhere near their targets.  But clearly I don't have a good handle on valuing growth stocks and identifying targets.

Since I don't have the time or expertise to get really fancy with fundamentals, I rely on P/S and P/E ratios to get a sense of valuations.  I look at those ratios relative to company peers, and relative to the typical range for that particular stock.  For example, if a stock was trading at a P/S range of 8-15 for the past two years, and is now trading at a P/S of 35, I consider that overpriced.  I develop target prices by picking a P/S or P/E range, based partly on the stock's history and expected future growth.  So in the example above, with a P/S range of 8-15, I might develop a target price based on a forward P/S range of 15-20.

Here's the problem, though.  When it comes to high growth stocks, my price targets are far too low because the valuations of these stocks have gotten so out of whack.  TTD is a great example.  I set a target price of around $400 based on future growth and started to get excited as it dropped to around $550, but then it shot back up and is now way out of my price range.  TTD is now trading at a P/E of 325 and forward P/E of almost 200, and a P/S of 45.

I hear people say that you can't pay such close attention to these ratios with growth stocks because they can grow so quickly, and at some point in their histories everyone thought stocks like AMZN, AAPL, GOOG, etc, were overpriced.  But their ratios never got too out of whack like today's growth stocks are.  The P/E sometimes does because earnings can be volatile, but I've found the P/S ratio to be pretty reliable.  Let's look at some examples of high priced stocks:

AMZN: historical P/S range of 1.1-4.5 (now a touch higher)

AAPL: historical P/S range of 1.7-5.6 (now a touch higher)

GOOG: 5.2-7.5 (currently within that range)

ISRG: 5-21 (currently within that range)

BKNG: 1.7-8.9 (currently within that range)

BABA: 6.7-16 (currently within that range)

MELI: 5-15 (now at 23)

But now look at some of the popular high growth stocks:

TTD: 5-20 (now at 45!)

DOCU: 6-36

NET: 12-19 (now at 51!)

NIO: 1.8-7.5 (now at 34!)

CRWD: now at 44

What do you notice?  The current P/S ratios of those growth stocks is way, way higher than most of the other big stocks ever were in their histories.  The most ""overpriced"" any of those stocks ever got in their histories was ISRG at a P/S of 21, and yet all of the current growth stocks are at P/S ratios twice that.  The ratios for stocks like CRWD and NET are 10-11x higher than AMZN's highest P/S ratio in its history.

Are these stocks overpriced and will eventually come down to more reasonable valuation levels?  Or are we seeing a fundamental change in the way growth stocks are valued?  Is this year's P/S ratio of 40 equivalent to a P/S ratio of 10 from five years ago?  How do we make sense of this?",9,0.82

Really? Check this out...

1 See news in Chinese for context -- it sounded really ugly.

""Worst Nov 11 (China's equivalent of ""Prime Day/Black Friday"") in history: Jack Ma & buddies LOST $2 trillion in 2 days"" [https://finance.sina.com.cn/tech/2020-11-11/doc-iiznezxs1326859.shtml](https://finance.sina.com.cn/tech/2020-11-11/doc-iiznezxs1326859.shtml) ... Why the contradiction? *NB: Yahoo and Wall Street have a stake in Alibaba?*

*Google more using Chinese characters 马云 = Jack Ma = Mǎ Yún (马云)*

Keypoint: Authority deliberately imposed many restrictions on labeling and what can be sold on Alibaba's Taobao on Nov 11... To understand this Commie strategy, read ""China tightens restrictions on Australian exports"" [https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-beijing-global-trade-australia-south-china-sea-ea95bc519eb9bf40172edc626caf5537](https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-beijing-global-trade-australia-south-china-sea-ea95bc519eb9bf40172edc626caf5537) ... same idea.

2. You must have heard of ""China drafts new antitrust guideline to rein in tech giants"" by now. What's the big deal? US and the west did the same thing (to MSFT, GOOG) ... nothing happened.

Well, you must have forgotten conviction rate in China is literally 99%. That's the difference.

3. Ant Financials IPO - The politics behind the suspension isn't something Joe can understand.

First, the timing - why IPO suspended on the eve of the debut? This is directly due to the 5th China Communist Party plenum that ended just before Jack Ma & co were told their $3 trillion Ant Financials IPO has been suspended.

Clue: No heir apparent as Xi Jinping reveals top leadership.

Still wondering what's happening? Here > The Boss wanna make sure all parties are obsessed with the world's largest and sauciest IPO, happy, and create no trouble during the party plenum, which is the ""Bilderberg"" of China that may give birth to China's new leader (*against Xi Jinping who wanna rule forever*)

Second, non-bank money-lending is considered loan-sharking no matter how hard you try masqurade the sin as ""fintech"" -- no different from trying to bypass the Fed with any other form of money (just google what happened to those who tried...). This is not to say China is shutting down Ant Financials becos Jack Ma created a new currency, it's becos Ant's microlending is seen as a timebomb for CCP.

How so?

Google keywords like ""China P2P Lending Suicide Scandal"", you'd see why did China cracked down the so called hitech ""P2P Lending"" industry that left behind nothing good except social ills like suicides, bankruptcies, etc (many still listed as pennystocks on NASDAQ like KXIN, WEI, etc. -- all were given 2 years to wind down and do something else)... Ant Financials is no difference for CCP believes Jack Ma & co. will leave behind the same mess so big that it may just collapse the CCP.

You see?

Plus, big-mouthed Jack Ma actually told this guy [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang\_Qishan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Qishan) that China regulators are dinosaur that neither understand nor capable of regulating ""fintech"".

TL;DR: Jack Ma is history -- He has been personally targeted to send out a clear message: ""Who's The Boss"" (just like why Trump fired Esper the other day). ""Xi Jinping going after Jack Ma's head"" [https://www.soundofhope.org/post/439876](https://www.soundofhope.org/post/439876)

Stocks traded higher throughout the day before pulling back steeply in the last hour of trading in another extremely volatile day. While major benchmarks are up around 4% in the last five trading days, intraday volatility has been extreme, making options trading difficult. Traders weighed a wild presidential debate and developments among Congressional lawmakers for further fiscal stimulus. Stocks recovered in the last 20 minutes of the market, capping off an extremely volatile final hour.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.68% up, the S&P (SPY) finished the day 0.59% up, and the Dow (DIA) led the day finishing 0.99% up. 

Yesterday’s presidential debate between Pres. Trump and Joe Biden proved to be an extremely contentious affairs, with Trump frequently interrupting both Biden the moderator, Chris Wallace who could not control the candidates, and a slew of highly personal attacks from both sides. The Guardian branded the debate ‘a national humiliation’. With the election in 36 days, analysts expect volatility to increase as November 3rd gets closer. Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said “I think markets are really nervous into those 36 days \[before the election\] and one of the things we have to think about is, when does nervousness price in the worst is yet to come? When do you think the worst is priced in? There’s $4.3 trillion in cash on the sidelines. I don’t think in the history of any financial market in the world do you ever have a top when there’s 20% of the equity market sitting in cash. Investor cash — that’s excluding the private equity cash, the record cash held by corporates too. So you’ve got tons of dry powder. People are bearish.”

The election comes against a dire economic situation, especially in the labor, with major corporations recently announcing new rounds of job cuts. Disney (DIS) announced it was slashing 28,000 jobs in their theme parks, cruise line, and retailers. Shell (RDS) announced it was cutting 9,000 jobs as the pandemic has affected the demand for oil. According to CNN business, tens of thousands of airline jobs could be lost as soon as tomorrow, as a federal prohibition on job cuts in the industry expires. Airline executives say they are prepared to keep workers only if Congress approves $25 billion in grants. 

Congressional lawmakers and the Trump administration are attempting to come to a deal in the near-term to provide additional fiscal relief to the families and small businesses that are struggling in the pandemic. House Democrats are pushing forward with a new $2.2 trillion proposal as speaker Pelosi and the White House make a final attempt to strike a deal before the election. Today, Pelosi and Mnuchin were unable to strike a deal after a 90-minute meeting. The pair said they will continue discussion as they continue to work to craft legislation that could pass both Houses of Congress. House Democrats are holding a vote on their plan today, a largely symbolic gesture as McConnel has already opposed the plan. Republicans are rumored to have a $1-1.5 trillion ceiling for any new relief legislation.

Stocks traded choppily today, as traders considered a new stimulus proposal from lawmakers, the presidential debate this evening, and an increase in Covid-19 infections.

Market action today highlights the extreme volatility of today’s market. After a day of green yesterday, the major indices experienced several intraday reversals. The Dow (DIA) finished 0.53% down, the S&P 500 finished 0.5#% down as well, and the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.45% down.

The House Democrats recently announced a new $2.2 trillion stimulus package, offering a sliver of hope that Congress might take action to help buoy the pandemic-stricken economy before the November elections. There is still a large divide between the Democrats proposal and the $1-1.5 trillion that is estimated to be the Republicans cap. Many analysts and economists are skeptical that a deal will be passed, leaving potential for market disappointment. On a more positive front, Pelosi and Mnuchin are scheduled to hold a meeting to discuss economic relief. Let’s hope they are able to work something out. 

This evening is the first of three presidential debates between Pres. Trump and Joe Biden in Cleveland, Ohio at 9pm ET. Last week the Commission on Presidential Debates announced that some topics set to be discussed are the “Trump and Biden’s records, the Supreme Court, Covid-19, the economy, race and violence in our cities, the integrity of the election.” Market participants will be closely watching each candidate's stance and agenda for dealing with the economy.

Sadly, the pandemic’s death toll has surpassed 200,000 in the United States, with 7.19 million people infected, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. Today, the American Academy of Pediatrics announced that children and teenagers now make up 10% up cases in the US, up from 2% in April, a worrying increase. The Central for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that “incidence of COVID-19 in school-age children began rising in early September as many youngsters returned to their classrooms.”

**Highlights** 

* The Conference Board’s index increased 15.5 points, the most since April 2003, to 101.8 from 86.3 in August, according to a report issued today. A group of economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted a score of 90, an estimate which was exceeded.

2015-02-24 20:42:21,GOOG is History's Most Complicated Tulip Bubble.,"There are two ways for a share to derive end user utility.  Through dividends and through being owned in a large enough quantity to actually affect ownership of the company.  Well what about non-voting GOOG Class - C shares?  You could own all the Class - C shares you want, and you'd still never own the company.  So that leaves dividends.  But GOOG doesn't pay a dividend.  But in the future it might.

But, for argument's sake, let's say that GOOG will never pay a dividend.  Or if that is too far fetched, then let's say Google releases a new Class - D share.  A, B, and C will pay a dividend, but D's are absolutely, 100%, set in stone, never going to pay a dividend.

Are Class - D shares worth anything?

Well of course.  But how?  They don't have any end user utility.  

Welcome to modern finance.  Either does a dollar bill.  There's a great scene in the Walking Dead where Daryl comes across a large bundle of money in a country club.  He takes the money and burns it.  Not only did the scene serve as a great character moment where we learn how resentful Daryl is for growing up in poverty, but it's also a wonderful social commentary.  With society collapsed, the only purpose money serves is to be burned.  Which is ironic.  Because money always burned.  It didn't have to be harvested, and inked, and printed out, and distributed thru a monetary policy by a central bank, to be traded back and forth for decades in various economic systems.  It could have just as easily been burnt as wood or crop.  Ash to ash.  Dust to dust.  But I digress.

Money's only value is fiduciary.  It's worth something because you can trade it for something else, and that something else will provide you with end utility.  Like a blow job or whatever.

So what does this have to do with stocks?  Well, stocks are essentially private currencies.  Just like money is backed by the full faith of the U.S. government, stocks are backed by the full faith of the corporation.  And just like the US government, corporations can inflate or deflate the supply.  And a currency's purchasing power is determined by the strength of it's underlying economy.  In case of a business, the underlying economics of the business. 
 
But the analogy does have limits.  A dollar can buy part of the economy by which it is backed.  But the Class - C can never do that.  Not that people seem to care.  There's a $2 difference between Class - A and Class - C shares.  Which is fitting, because they all essentially have zero voting rights because the founders own the Class - B shares. 

The Class - C's only value is that some day, Google may offer a dividend.  (And Class - A has the additional value that some day, the founders will give up their 56% voting stake, and Class - A's one vote will matter again.)

But I doubt anyone is actually valuing Class - A and Class - C shares based on future dividend and ownership possibilities.  They're being traded on the greater fool theory.  That they can sell it for more than they paid for it.  And I doubt that Class - D shares would trail Class - C shares by any meaningful amount.

So it's kind of funny.  Centuries after the tulip bubble, we're up to the same old tricks.  Except this time we're not even trading something as tangible as a tulip.  We're trading numbers that exist in electricity and magnetism.  Mankind's evolution is astounding.

2020-09-26 14:04:59,Why I blame AAPL for this selloff,"Firstly I'd just like to say in general, I am not an apple user, I in fact hate the OS but thats not why I blame them for this crash nor does it make me at all bias when dealing with the market.

To put this as simply as I can to save anyone time if you don't want to read the technicals or to get an overview, they are waaaay overvalued and make up too much of the market indexes. Simple reasoning, hype and fear. Suddenly after covid apple became 'a safe stock to keep money in' then hype built, then a split, now its just the realization of all that accumulation that has caused a sell off. 

But lets get technical cuz any idiot could use that reasoning. First lets talk about Apple, their business model, and their history. Founded in 1974 by Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, funded by Ronald Wayne. Wayne is inconsequential to the business so he wont come up again. Wozniak hasnt been involved since the 80s and Jobs has been gone almost a decade now. The motto behind Apple though was opposite of Microsoft's. Apple built things consumers needed and that marketed themselves. Microsoft built tech we didnt know we needed and sold that to manufacturers, not consumers. One is consumer based one is tech based, yes apple is a tech giant, but their basic business model is about consumer products, not technological advancements. I realize a lot of their products were technological advancements, but that wasnt what their business model was. If there hadnt been the market for a better smartphone we never would have gotten the iphone. There is a video online of steve jobs responding to an insult, and he basically states this during that video and its clear in what they produce and focus on. Most of these are things we see and use every day, thats the point. While yes we use Microsoft products literally every day, we aren't nearly as consciously aware of it as we are apple products. 

Apple has also basically stopped advancing rapidly, while every year phones improve they continue to do what they did in the 80s, fall further and further behind the competition. Microsoft bailed them out in the 80s with dos coding and they got bailed out in the early 00s by Tony Fadell and phillips electronics with the ipod. Guess what, they are falling behind again. 

Now lets talk the stock. 
For one, the market is based on growth, in order for a stock price to go up growth must be invisioned by investors otherwise why would anyone chase it up. Since 2015 apple has stalled though. While it's seeing great sales, the growth has stalled out, meanwhile the stock continues to go up and up, pretty counterintuitive, first warning sign.
AAPL growth https://imgur.com/gallery/vgoQBcD

Besides sales, technical chart analysis on apple should make any investor nervous. Here are 4 big market caps making up a good chunk of the nasdaq; apple, amazon, Microsoft, and google, with some trend lines im going to refer to:
MSFT https://imgur.com/gallery/x9pCHR4
AMZN https://imgur.com/gallery/r6uEPq4
GOOG https://imgur.com/gallery/krlTgba
AAPL https://imgur.com/gallery/pxtv4Uj

Did you see it? All of these are over their trend lines (google not much), but its a matter of why and how much higher. 

Ill start with Microsoft, 3 steady lines, 2010-2013, then 2013-2018, then 2018 to covid. Since covid Microsoft has seen growth in the use of their platforms like microsoft teams. So it makes sense they went a little higher. 

Amazon has 3 as well, 2010-2015, 2015-covid, post covid. This one frankly makes the most sense as amazon clearly got a major shot in the arm for business with covid lockdowns. So yes amazon is a lot higher, but they should be with everyone shopping from home as much as we are. Id also like to just note the richest man in the world jeff bezos makes around 215 million dollars a DAY. Amazon made over 280 billion last year, apple made 260 billion. Yet who again has the bigger market cap? Warning sign number 2 here.

Google has had the most steady trend lines of all of them, they have been on their current trend since 2017 but also have 3 trend lines total, 2010 to 2014 and 2014 to 2017. They are actually currently still right on that trend line and considering how diverse owning one share makes you (space x, ai, etc), this might be one of the mist undervalued stocks on the market right now.

Now our baby Apple, you have a trend line from basically 2010 to 2018. Since 2018 they started taking off, i guess that kinda makes sense since thats when their sales picked back up. But they had been growing for 8 years prior with no real world growth. Warning sign number 3.
Then if we zoom in with some trend lines drawn, well take a look: Apple trend lines https://imgur.com/gallery/Uhm3xT5
Since they announced their split jul 31st they have been moving parabolic (unsustainably vertical). Look how far off any realistic trend line it got, that is so far overextended of course its going to pull back violently. And now that their market cap (which is overvalued) is so big, when they move we all move. Microsoft is coming out with the xbox and all the gaming stocks are starting to go nuts right now, why isnt Microsoft, because of apple. If the Nasdaq looks terrible (thanks apple) the whole sector starts to bail and get into other recovery stocks like banks and travel, which is what happened. 

Apple went up 30% in august, microsoft went up 12.5%. Not even remotely close to the same kind of move. Microsoft went from 202 to 237, apple went from 97 to 137. To expnd further upon this, lets look at even prior to that. Microsoft went from 174 on may 1st to 202 july 31, thats up $28 or 13.86%. During that same period apple went from 72 to 97, thats up $25 or 25.8%, double what microsoft did in both cases. Dont tell me they all performed the same.

Now tech is starting to recover and the small caps are seeing big gains. But these larger caps may get stuck in place because apple realistically, still has a long way to fall. Id be willing to bet apple falls under 97 soon, followed by plummeting to 87-88, that is where the stock should actually be IMO based on chart analysis. 

Oh and here is how Samsung compared to Apple stock. Samsung vs Apple https://imgur.com/gallery/JirJ88i
Yeah apple is not that much bigger than Samsung and havent taken away their market share. Both are direct competitors that do the exact same thing.

I'm still overall bullish on the market, but damnit apple, you are not the biggest company in the world, you don't have a monopoly on phones and computers, you can't even advance your business more (they are trying with things like apple pay). Hurry up and correct yourself so we can start getting back into these great major caps like the Microsoft's, Amazon's, and Google's. 

Sorry if this sounded like a vent, but there seems to be so many things that people are just totally willing to completly overlook with apple, cuz its apple. At least thats my two cents and thanks for reading.

Part if my other problem with apple is its a lot like tesla. A lot of apple users swear by it and think they will run the world, the same people downvote this due to denial of facts. Apple isnt the biggest company in the world and it shouldnt even be in the top 5 realistically.",0,0.27

&#x200B;

Bull charge headfirst into red flags, and bear hibernate.  Here we are in the weekend of the first week of May, people's businesses are folding, renters demanding rent breaks, landlords sweating over insolvency and heart attacks just lost top spot in killer diseases to the most contagious virus any of us have ever seen in our lives; but none of this matter. Fed make market big big! Big big forever!

The bull [died  on the 28th of March](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/g23ueb/the_bull_market_is_a_headless_chicken_and_the/).   The market *did break.* Just because people jumped in to short too early and have been getting roughed up 'Fighting the Fed' it does not change anything.  This spectacular 'Unprecedented' rally has not went up any more than historic bull traps.  The spiral of reduced wages > reduced spending > reduced business profits > reduced wages (Loop) is still spinning. '[BRR BRR big big](https://imgur.com/a/S1T7IQQ)' is not improving real  GDP.

&#x200B;

People think the market is not making sense, or not doing what it'd do if it was going to crash. This is not true. It's only not doing what you think it should do based upon what the news is telling you.  Once we'd seen the drop  of March what was to be expected was a bounce from the low and a [strong rally up to about 25,000  on the Dow peppered with positive news events.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/16/dow-jones-enters-end-of-denial-stage-and-start-of-the-bull-trap/)  All  of us who know how to trade have been waiting for that.

The market crash is going to be brutal. The second leg of the move will be bigger than the first one.  The low of the next drop can be under 50% from the high, and all the reasons people say that can't happen they said for the 2019 low breaking in  January, 2020.   A time when a 0.5% drop was considered buying the dip.

What has taken weeks to go up will take hours to come down.  [A headline will come from no-where](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/gatjxp/whatever_it_is_will_be_on_the_news/) and everything you think you know one day means nothing tomorrow.

&#x200B;

I've done a lot of work on this trade.  How a trend fails and reverses is something I know a lot about. Whatever you do as an occupation and hobby - I know as much about this as you do about that. This is both my job and passion.  [I'm betting a lot of money on it,](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/gbq6eu/big_short_end_of_day_3/) and I got my money by being really good at betting money in markets.

I think the market is setting up to wipe people out.  Your warning sign of this is going to be the arrival of bad news in the coming week and a fall down to break the low of March. Around this time the news may seem to get better - but this will be your final chance to get out at a cheap loss (and yes, I consider a March low exit cheap relative to what June can bring).

&#x200B;

I'm not saying my forecasts are perfect. They are not, but they really have been good enough to do sensationally well during 2020. I've been short from feb. Long during early April and built up a short in the 24,000 - 25,000 Dow range.   I'll paste below a walk through of analysis and trades to this point. If you care to, you can check the accuracy of it and decide how useful my perspective is.

\---

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The US indices have been [forming a bubble](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/02/29/formingbubbles/) over the last 50 years. In 2000 and 2008 we seen the early 'Bear trap' sections of the bubble and then in the following decade we seen enthusiasm become greed and greed become delusion. The 30% gain in the S&P500 through the year 2019 was the final stages of this bubble.

Here is a post describing us being in the ['Delusion' stage of the bubble in January of 2020](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPX/KY1p7aZa-50-Years-Could-End-in-Tears-for-US-Indices/).

The pop of this bubble and the following bear market will not be a nice fast one like the crashes of 2000 and 2008, it will be a more drawn out affair where prices drop far lower. The crash of the 2020's will be more like the crash of the 1930's depression. See the analysis [leading to this conclusion here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/us-indices-bubble-in-style-reflecting-the-great-depression-of-1930/)

In the months of January and February major US indices traded into the zone where a bubble template would be looking for the top to be made. Read about how this method has [worked in previous crashes here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/05/how-technical-analysis-has-signalled-previous-stock-market-highs-and-now-again-in-2020/) First forecasts in late January were mostly stopped out. There were losing signals on the Dow [around 29,300](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/RGkn3RjW-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Support-Levels-in-the-Week-Ahead/) and some in [February at 28,900](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/xWSFpsRi-Selling-Dow-28-900/). Individual stocks shorts done poorly, One exception was the Vanguard dividends index VYM. This did make it's high on the [exact price first posted.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/VYM/BlWd0mFm-Popular-Vanguard-Has-High-Exposure-to-Bad-Market-Conditions/)

Individual stocks picks done particularly poorly in January. TSLA almost doubled from the first [shorting price of 510.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TSLA/FOs1PP5d-Tesla-Could-Breakdown-Soon/) Some did a bit better. [Like shorting T at 39.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/T/IUgQyy8k-AT-T-Vulnerable-Debt-Cash-Flow-Leaks/)

Later in February more sell signals were generated as price traded briefly over important resistance levels. If price broke back under these it would suggest market weakness. These were [170 on VTI](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/VTI/IPRCTQh9-VTI-Enters-the-Stubborn-Stage-of-a-Possible-Reversal/) and [29,000 on the Dow.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/LiV4pmmH-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Downside-Break-Possible/) Once these levels were broken the bear market began. In the following days a signal for a [30% drop on the Dow Jones came](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/Cd6Il3np-Next-Series-of-Falls-Can-Take-Dow-Down-10-000-Points/) (and was successful).

Individual stock picks did much better in February. High prices were signalled in [MSFT](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/MSFT/LWCMh0jH-Microsoft-Setting-Up-For-Hard-Landing/), [BRK](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/BRK.A/bHDf6D7j-Buffet-s-the-King-of-the-Bag-Holders/), [SPCE](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPCE/uFAroqOi-SPCE-and-Gravity/), [GOOG](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/GOOG/m56g98mU-Weekly-Bearish-Butterfly-Pattern/). A high on [AMZN was called](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/AMZN/b4DOD5dy-The-Amazon-Bubble/), but price later traded higher. The best signal generated was a buy on the [TVIX from 34 to 800.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TVIX/ts9VcIlG-TVIX-Long-Term-Trend-Line-Break/)

In the month of March , 2020, the bubble popped. Most risk based assets and indices crashed over 30%. First analysis post said to [wait for a bounce to sell into](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/nVbfBVXn-Dow-Bounces-Like-a-Brick-While-Making-Big-Breakout/), but this was updated before the market opened to say prices could fall [8% and then 30% in March.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/30-dow-jones-drop/) At this point the TradingView account was suspended. Only one account is allowed, and this was set up specifically for a 2020's bear market. So no further posts or updates were made there.

On the 3rd of March came the first signal to [look for the down move entering somewhere in the 16,000 - 18,000 area](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/16/dow-jones-enters-end-of-denial-stage-and-start-of-the-bull-trap/) on the Dow Jones. Followed by a post on the 16th of March saying [we're entering into the bull trap.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/31/optimism-in-the-air-as-end-of-bull-trap-approaches/) The low on the Dow would be made around 18,250 on the 23rd of March. From here a rally began which has made a current high of 24,500.

April of 2020 has been the bull trap month. Some losing signals have been generated in the later couple weeks of April. A few calls on the top of the bull trap have been made. Prices have not went substantially higher, they've just not dropped. A forecast on the [17th of April marks the current high](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/16/17th-april-2020-the-bull-trap-completes/), but it looks like price can trade a bit higher. A post on the 19th of April calls for a crash in the S&P500 to [1,600 within the next 5 - 10 weeks](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/19/19th-of-april-here-comes-an-attitude-readjustment/).

Today is the 25th of April. Over the last two weeks forecasts of a big drop starting have been inaccurate. I very strongly suspect this is akin to the sell signals generated in late January and early February. It's the right idea, but it's just the wrong time. A top in the Dow Jones somewhere in the 24,000 - 25,000",43,0.71

Apple turned it down as they probably did not feel they had the infrastructure to support or not able to protect their networks.   Google and Microsoft took them up on it.   

Google did not have any reported problems and was the most popular site to stream the movie.   The Microsoft Xbox network has been up and down over the last 36 hours.   Does not seem Xbox network problems are actually related to the movie but a different group taking down their network with DDoS attacks.

2016-01-28 09:28:12,Revealed: How much Google ($GOOG) paying Apple ($AAPL) to keep search Bar on iPhone? What about profits from Android?,"In 2014, Google ($GOOG) paid Apple $1 billion just to keep the search bar on the iPhone. Such data surfaced during the trial between Oracle ($ORCL) (capitalization of $ 43 billion) and $481 billion dollar giant Google ($GOOG).

Oracle’s ($ORCL) lawyer revealed a ten digit at the hearing, it served as a result of an agreement between Apple ($AAPL) and Google ($GOOG), as a percentage of revenue the search engine Google was working on the iPhone in 2014. At one point in the distribution of income it was 34% to 66%, but Google’s ($GOOG) lawyer appealed the hearing further disclosure of these percentages as they are tentative.

Oracle’s ($ORCL) lawyer was also operating the income figure from the Android OS, which totaled $31 billion, with net income of $22 billion. Thus, she raised the figures that have never been made public, and finds them “extraordinary scale of commercialism”.

Google asked the judge to keep under seal some evidence transcripts of the court, as “they are extremely confidential and public disclosure could negatively affect the company’s business».

By the way, Oracle ($ORCL) sued Google ($GOOG) in August 2010, stating that the Internet giant has violated the rights and patents Java, using them in Android OS. The Company assesses the damage and said they want Google($GOOG) to pay Oracle ($ORCL) $1 billion.",2,0.75

Disclaimers: I'm not a FA, and don't pretend to be one. New to reddit, but not to the market. Securities I  currently own are **bolded** so you can check my bias. :)

WMT - Talk about a ship that has been steady through the storm. I sold all of mine back in 2016, fearing cuts to entitlement programs would essentially cut their workforce by 30% overnight. Those cuts never came, and now I want back in.  Grocery pickup and delivery has been the future for a while, but COVID seems to have fast tracked that transition. IMO, it will remain highly popular post pandemic, Walmart will expand on it, and 5 years from now >70% of grocery sales will be a direct competition between them and **AMZN**. I'm taking this one as soon as the right opening appears, with the expectation of holding it long term.  

**KO** \- First share I ever bought, never let it go, added to it over the years, and might be adding more tomorrow.  Not much to say here. It's priced well and has a scheduled earnings report before opening bell on Tues.  The recent relative success of consumer markets (WMT, **AMZN**, **TGT**, COST) leads me to think that will be a positive report, and if I see nothing indicating otherwise, I'll try to stock up and ride the wave.  Big fan of **PEP** as well -- more diversified than **KO**, but KFC/Tacobell/PH will probably slow any aggressive gains for a while.

**MSFT** \- Grain of salt time. This is my favorite holding on the market, bar none. **MSFT** and **AMZN** have essentially held up the whole average during this rebound period. It's all about those beautiful beautiful clouds y'all. (military contracts don't hurt either, see **BA**...) It's always a good time to buy Microsoft. 

GOOG/**GOOGL** \- has a bright future in similar areas to **MSFT**, but I hate companies that live and die by advertisement revenue. For that reason I have a very limited holding in only 1 out of the 2, and I stay away from FB and TWT as well.  ITS ALWAYS A GOOD TIME TO BUY MICROSOFT.

T and **DAL** \- like Coke, they both have earnings to report this week. I think Delta will produce a decent report which will confuse some who don't fully understand that the pandemic split quarters, and much of the carnage won't be known until the end of Q2. If it does bump up, I'll offload shares and buy back lower in the early summer. **DAL** has the best balance sheet as well as the second best executive team in the whole airline industry, and I don't see it going anywhere. T on the other hand looks to be primed for injury if they report negative earnings.  If they fall back below 26, I'm an AT&T buyer all day long. 

NFLX - If it were my money, I'd wait for the (very likely) record high earnings report coming up, ride the wave, and sell high.  I'm not a fan of companies who can't seem to be profitable despite overwhelming popularity. Average NFLX account is accessed by >8 users, but only paid for by 1. New competitors emerging. The whole company model just sketches me out. Go prove me wrong Netflix.... but I'll continue to pass for now.

SNE - Gaming has grown in quarantine, Playstation 5 is set to release in the next 2 months, and the stock still has solid rebound potential from its high. I'm at a solid buy here, and I've never owned it before.... so thats exciting!

**V** and **MC** \- Every single reputable study shows that the very first debt people default on in a recession is their credit card bill. BE VERY CAREFUL HERE.

TSLA - Volatile, Bullish, Enigmatic.... I have no idea what's happening here.  Tesla fanboy's overwhelming enthusiasm make market predictions hard. I'll buy if it drops below 580 again. Don't own any now. Damn sure wish I did....

Other stuff I like right now - **BA**, **JNJ**, **LOW**, **SAVE**, **TDOC**, MDT, HD, **ABT**

Other stuff I'm neutral on - **PG**, LUV, DIS, **NKE**, SHOP, **AMD**, **Oil stocks** (will likely go even lower next month), and **many many many others**.....

Other stuff I hate right now - **AAPL**, cruise lines, or any company that can't survive another big dip. Nobody knows if it's coming. be smart.

2020-07-25 06:51:57,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning July 27th, 2020","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 27th, 2020.

# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/24/here-comes-one-of-the-newsiest-and-most-critical-weeks-of-the-summer-for-markets.html)**
*****
> In a summer of unending news, we may be heading into what could be the newsiest week of all.
*****
> The Nasdaq’s sputtering rally could be put to its biggest test yet, as tech bellwether Apple and other stalwarts of the tech rally report earnings. Early in the week, Republicans will unveil their stimulus package proposal, which will then be debated as Friday’s deadline nears for the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits.
*****
> The Federal Reserve also meets on and is likely to discuss other steps it can take. It’s not likely, however, to make any moves as it wraps up on Wednesday, other than to assure markets it will continue to use extraordinary programs to help the economy.
*****
> Then on Thursday, the government will release a big number many investors have been dreading — the first official reading of second quarter gross domestic product, which which should show how hard the economy crashed when it was abruptly shut down.
*****
> Economists expect a contraction of about 35% in the second quarter, followed by a bounce back in the third quarter. But the size of that comeback could be directly impacted by how much stimulus Congress gives the economy, and how much the coronavirus continues to impact businesses and economic activity.
*****
> “I think there’s a clear understanding of how much the economy has leaned on the crutch of government stimulus, both fiscally and monetarily,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. “Everyone will be watching for what will replace the $600 a week, and that will be the most important component of whatever plan they come up with.”
*****
> The $600 weekly payment to about 30 million unemployed Americans expires Friday, and it is unlikely Congress will have a plan before that date. Strategists expect the amount to be cut in half, and Boockvar said the amount of that payment will directly impact the size of the boost to the economy
*****
> The stimulus and tech earnings could both be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead.
*****
> “What the package looks like will be a huge deal, particularly on the unemployment benefits side, and whether tech companies can exceed the bar,” said Boockvar. “That’s very hard for them right now. So if they miss, does that mean it’s going to be a negative for tech and not the whole market? Are we going to keep rotating to value from growth because tech has been so dominant it could take everything down?”
*****
> Earnings for the S&P 500 companies are expected to decline by 40.3% for the second quarter, based on the results of companies that have already reported and estimates, according to Refinifiv’s I/B/E/S. Technology earnings are expected to have one of the smallest profit declines, at just 4.4% on average.
*****
> The Nasdaq, which had rallied to record highs this summer, ended lower for a second week, while the Dow and S&P 500 were higher.
*****
> “The earnings numbers overall, they’ve been pretty good. It’s just the basic problem with the stock market right now is that valuations are still pretty high,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. “Other parts of the market that maybe look cheap on a price-to-book basis, their earnings have been hit. In the case of certain retailers, airlines, you have to worry about when their business is going to come back, if ever.”
*****
> About 80% of the companies already reporting have beaten Wall Street estimates. That is well above the average beat rate of about 65%, since 1994.
*****
> Dozens of major companies report in the coming week, including Facebook on Wednesday and Alphabet and Amazon on Thursday. Pharmaceuticals Merck, Pfizer and Eli Lilly are expected to report, and consumer products names Starbucks, McDonald’s and Procter & Gamble also release results. Big oil, Exxon Mobil and Chevron report Friday.
*****
> # Stimulus from Congress and the Fed
> Strategists expect Congress to ultimately adopt a new stimulus package of between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, but after the GOP plan is introduced it will have to be squared with Democrats’ proposals. The House has its own $3 trillion spending plan. It is unlikely an agreement can be approved before unemployment benefits expire Friday.
*****
> “Bipartisan negotiations between the White House, House, and Senate are officially underway, but we expect brinkmanship before passage. Trump administration officials also diverge on their expectations on timing, which remains optimistically by the end of July, and possibly stretching into August under the more ‘realistic’ case,” writes Ed Mills, policy strategist at Raymond James.”
*****
> Mills expects the $600 weekly payment to be cut to $300 or $400, and he said it’s possible there would be more funds given to a Payroll Protection Program, to help small businesses.
*****
> “Overall, momentum is building for the next package and the final price tag is arguably moving up (closer to $1.5 -2 trillion),” Mills noted. Congress has already allocated $2.4 trillion in prior spending.
*****
> The Fed will be discussing its own stimulus, and some economists expect it could again be talking about new tactics to keep interest rates low. One idea is a policy of forward guidance, where the Fed would steer market expectations more explicitly. Another is the Fed would use targeted Treasury purchases to control specific interest rates. But no new programs are expected to be announced.
*****
> “They pretty much told us, they’re all in. They told us they’re willing to do whatever else it takes,” said Keon. “The Fed is not going to be our problem. The Fed just told us they’re going to do anything they can do to soften the blow from the virus.”

# Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week

> The earnings slate continues to ramp up next week with 712 total companies scheduled to report. In the table below, we show the largest stocks by market cap that are set to report quarterly results. On Monday, there will be no company with a market cap above $100 billion reporting with the largest companies being Alexandria Real Estate (ARE) and multiple banks. On Tuesday, payment processor Visa (V) will be out with earnings in addition to Pfizer (PFE), Amgen (AMGN), McDonald's (MCD), and Raytheon (RTX). Visa has historically averaged the strongest stock price reaction to earnings of these names but it has gapped down for six straight quarters. That will be followed by another payment processor, Paypal (PYPL) on Wednesday. In addition to Paypal, Facebook (FB) is also scheduled to report that same day. While both stocks have averaged over 2% gains on earnings days historically, ServiceNow (NOW) has seen an even stronger performance with an average gain of 3.64%. Another major earnings report that will be widely watched is Boeing (BA) to get a gauge on how demolished travel demand has affected the company. On Thursday, three of the world's largest stocks will also be out with earnings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG). Each one has averaged a 1%+ gain on earnings days. Apple (AAPL) has seen some of the strongest results in recent history with last quarter snapping a streak of four consecutive triple plays. On Friday, two of the largest energy stocks, Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), will round out the week and July's earning calendar. Both stocks have historically averaged declines on earnings days.

# Dollar Weakness May Continue

> The US dollar was remarkably strong during the first quarter of 2020, benefitting from the flight to safety and rallying to nearly a 10% year-to-date gain at the stock market’s low point on March 23. However, as equity markets have recovered, and the US has continued to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, the dollar has given up nearly all of those gains. We think this trend may continue, and if so, it would have important implications for a range of asset classes.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a more diversified basket than the commonly cited DXY Index, is nearing a critical uptrend line. A break of this support could mean that weakness seen over the past few months is more than just an unwinding of the flight to safety. Through Wednesday, the index was down more than 1% for the week and tracking toward its fourth straight weekly loss.

> This isn’t just a technical story though. As we explored last month, rising twin deficits have historically been followed by a weaker dollar, meaning the fundamentals support this move as well.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/July-23-picture.png?ssl=1))**

> The commodity rally is another reason to believe the market may be looking toward a weaker dollar. Commodities are typically viewed as having an inverse relationship with the dollar since the dollar is effectively the denominator of a hard asset. Gold prices are up more than 20% year to date, copper just traded to its highest level in more than two years, and silver prices have appreciated 28% this month alone.

> As for the implications of a weaker dollar, according to LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, “a weaker US dollar may be a slight negative for US consumers’ buying power, but for investors’ portfolios the implications are overwhelmingly positive. Commodities are rallying, US multinational companies benefit from foreign buyers being able to afford more of their goods, and international stocks do well as their underlying currencies appreciate.”

> Recent history bears this out. The last calendar year that saw a significant dollar decline was 2017 when the Bloomberg Dollar Index fell more than 8%. The S&P 500 Index rallied more than 19% on a price return basis; however, international stocks fared even better. The MSCI EAFE Index and MSCI Emerging Markets Index gained 22% and 34%, respectively, and 2017 represented the only year since 2012 that either outperformed the US.

# Silver Gets the Gold for YTD Performance

> In last night's Closer, we took a look at the massive rallies of late in the precious metals space. Gold (GLD) reached its highest level since 2011, but silver's (SLV) performance on the day was even more of a sight to behold with gains in the top 1% of all days since SLV began trading in 2006. Silver (SLV) rose 6.15% for its best day since March 24th when the metal rose 7.96%. Whereas the silver to gold ratio has been in a constant downtrend over the past decade (indicating underperformance of silver relative to gold), yesterday's big gains led to a breakout of this downtrend. With SLV trading higher by over 5% yet again this morning, that downtrend is being broken even more significantly, and that is even with SLV off the pre-market highs above $21.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072220-SLV-GLD.png))**

> As recently as the final days of June, SLV was actually sitting on a loss year to date. That was a far cry from the performance of some of the best-performing assets of the year at the time like the Tech heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) which was up over 14% and the long term Treasuries ETF (TLT) which was up over 21.5%. Silver's yellow cousin, gold, was likewise sitting on a sizeable gain of 16.6%. Pivot ahead to today and the picture is very different. Around this morning's premarket highs when SLV was trading above $21, it actually topped QQQ, TLT, and GLD as the best performing asset in 2020. That is even with each of these other ETFs also trading higher.

# Hot Julys Often Bring Late-Summer/Autumn Buys

> Despite persistent pandemic setbacks, bleak economic and corporate numbers, geopolitical tensions, civic unrest and a knock-down, drag-out election battle, the U.S. stock market has proven rather resilient. After suffering the shortest bear market in history that lasted only 40 days the velocity and strength of the V-shaped rally off the March 23 bear market low has been impressive.

> Massive fiscal stimulus, the return of ZIRP (zero interest rate policy), vaccine promise and the boon of the “stay-at-home” economy have sent the market higher again here in July with NASDAQ tacking on new all-time highs, though the Dow and S&P 500 continue to struggle. As of yesterday’s close this put DJIA up 4.6%, S&P 500 up 5.7% and NASDAQ up 6.4% for the month of July at yesterday’s close, qualifying this as a “Hot July Market”.

> Gains of this magnitude for July, however, have frequently been followed by a late-summer or autumn selloffs and better buying opportunities than now. In the past, full-month July gains in excess of 3.5% for DJIA have been followed historically by declines of -7.2% on average (-4.7% median decline) in the Dow with a low at some point in the last 5 months of the year. The low in 2018 came a bit late, but it was just 2 days into winter. There were also prior lower prices in late October and November.

> Climbing COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths have forced rollbacks and pauses of economic reopening plans and travel restrictions. Coupled with an uptick in jobless claims and other troublesome economic readings and forecasts as well as elevated valuations, exuberant sentiment, technical resistance and seasonal weakness, stocks are ripe for a pullback. Today’s selloff: case in point. This will likely set up a great buy as the $13+ trillion flows through the global economy into US stocks.

2020-09-25 10:44:45,Wall Street's top stories at midday," Stocks rising at midday as Democrats work on new stimulus bid

The major averages are higher at midday, as the Nasdaq leads the way with a greater than 1% advance. While concern remains over the U.S. elections and disappointment that Washington has not delivered more stimulus, there may be potential for the stimulus talks to resume as reports indicate the Democrats are working on a new proposal.

**ECONOMIC EVENTS:** In the U.S., durable goods orders edged up 0.4% in August, which was less than expected.

Data from the [Johns Hopkins](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) Whiting School of Engineering shows there are now 32.3M confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, including nearly 7M in the U.S., and 984,278 deaths due to the disease, including about 203,000 in the U.S.

**TOP NEWS:** Shares of Costco (COST) are 2% lower near noon after the company reported quarterly results last night. Morgan Stanley analyst Simeon Gutman, who said the ""knock"" on the report was weaker flow-through than market expectation, thinks this should prove temporary and sees a rare ""buy the dip"" opportunity with the stock off its early September high, he told investors following the earnings report as he and several peers raised their price targets for the stock.   


In M&A news, William Hill (WIMHY) noted press speculation regarding a possible offer for the company and confirmed that it has received separate cash proposals from Apollo Management (APO) and Caesars Entertainment (CZR). ""Following an initial written proposal from Apollo on August 27, William Hill received a further proposal from Apollo and proposals from Caesars,"" the company said. Discussions are ongoing and each of Apollo and Caesars are required, by not later than 5.00 p.m. London time on October 23, to either announce a firm intention to make an offer for William Hill or announce that they do not intend to make an offer, the company added.

In COVID-19 news, Novavax announced that it has initiated its first Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of NVX-CoV2373, Novavax' COVID-19 vaccine candidate. The trial is being conducted in the United Kingdom, or UK, in partnership with the UK Government's Vaccines Taskforce and is expected to enroll and immunize up to 10,000 individuals between 18-84 years of age, with and without relevant comorbidities, over the next four to six weeks. Meanwhile, European governments will pay claims over an agreed upon limit against AstraZeneca (AZN) over unexpected side-effects from its potential COVID-19 vaccine, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-eu-astrazeneca/exclusive-astrazeneca-gets-partial-immunity-in-low-cost-eu-vaccine-deal-idUSL5N2GK3NE), citing an EU official. These terms are different than the terms of the agreement with Sanofi (SNY) as AstraZeneca secured the European Union's backing in a confidential agreement which reflects the lower price requested by the drugmaker, the official noted.

Reuters [reported ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tiktok/judge-says-u-s-must-defend-or-delay-tiktok-app-store-ban-by-friday-idUSKCN26F35F?il=0)that U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols said that the White House must either postpone a ban on U.S. app stores offering TikTok for download or file legal documents defending the decision by Friday. The U.S. Commerce Department order banning Apple (AAPL) or Google's (GOOG) app stores from offering TikTok for new downloads is set to occur late Sunday. Oracle (ORCL) and Walmart (WMT) have agreed to take stakes in TikTok Global, a newly created U.S. company that will own most of the app's operations worldwide.    


**MAJOR MOVERS:** Among the noteworthy gainers was Colony Capital (CLNY), which rose 9% after it agreed to sell six hospitality portfolios to Highgate for $2.8B. Also higher was MobleIron (MOBL), which jumped 19% after Dealreporter said that the company is in advanced talks to be acquired. 

Among the notable losers was Fluor (FLR), which slid 4% after it suspended all prior 2020 guidance. Also lower was First Majestic (AG), which fell 7% after it said it is assessing legal options in its dispute with Servicio de Administraction Tributaria. 

**INDEXES:** Near midday, the Dow was up 106.44, or 0.40%, to 26,921.88, the Nasdaq was up 128.47, or 1.20%, to 10,800.74, and the S&P 500 was up 20.24, or 0.62%, to 3,266.83.",12,0.94

I’ve never invested in anything before so it’s a first for me. after some reading i got to know that my safest bet is an S&P 500 ETF, but since I’m still young and starting i can go for some risks. So here’s what I’m thinking.

Amazon

2019-12-11 14:29:38,Post your 2020 Picks for 2030 and reasoning behind them,"Like the title says, post your picks for 2020 that you will hold til 2030. 

Let's rewind to December of 2009. FB is not yet public. TWTR's tweets are still petite and the stock is unlisted. GOOG is back at $300 for the first time since its pre-recession peak. AAPL is also nearly back at $30, returning to pre-recession highs. MSFT is also at $30, where it has been stagnant since falling after its monopoly-esque problems. 

Fast forward to 2019. FB is at $200. TWTR is now listed and at $30, down from its IPO and recent highs near $45. GOOG is now at $1345. AAPL is $280. And MSFT is $151. Hot damn. Had you been holding since 12/2009, you would have made quite a return on any of these giants.

Internet consumption tripled from 50 minutes to 157 minutes from 2009 to 2019. TV dropped from 187 minutes to 163. 

But this major shift is IMO what is driving the internet boom. 

So what does this mean for 2030? What stocks should we pick now for 4-10X return in 10 years? 

I think the trend from 2009-2019 will continue through to 2029 even if the relative gains of internet consumption decrease. There is still XX time elsewhere to cannibalize, on TOP of 163 minutes of daily TV time. 

That internet time consumed by average person has tripled, and that the companies that benefit from this have more than tripled, belies the importance of media consumption and the tech revolution as we look forward to 2029. So to that end, what will still be around in 2029, what will be more consumed, what will be more profitable, and what will people be DOING more than today?

I think the 107 minute per day gain in media is going to hold over the next ten years re: internet use. As people have more free time in general due to the proliferation of the gig economy (tech insecurity = semi-unemployment / gig economy = media use in off time, besides increasing media use in general), FB, TWTR, GOOG are only going to become more engrained into society's everyday functioning. 

I am currently long on FB, and I think TWTR will be the next addition due to its recent drop. TWTR was tracking FB nicely post-2018 correction, and I believe the current price offers an entry target that is substantially undervalued. 

I see 2020 offering a major boon to both companies as election attention ramps up. TWTR will be a bigger name than ever this cycle as it plays out on the internet vs. TV more than any previous cycle (a trend that will only continue in 2024 and 2028). While concerns about FB's reach exist, I do not think they will result in a break-up as long as TWTR survives, as it removes the claims of monopoly. So TWTR's survival is actually also in FB's interest and as it survives it will only become more ubiquitous now that it is profitable. 

I think MSFT and AAPL and GOOG are probably great bets for 2029 as well, but I love FB and TWTR's potential over the next 10 years and would argue FB in particular could be like AAPL around 2009 in terms of impending growth. TWTR could be more of a GOOG. But both offer major return potential. 

Looking ten years ahead, what are your picks, why are the above picks wrong, ETC? :)

I also like ADBE ($37 in 12/2019 to $303 today), Cloudflare aka NET (IPO @$18, waiting til lockup to consider buying but I love it), OHI (Omega Healthcare, $19 in 09 to $42 today with big dividend), and maybe UBER next year.",403,0.95

2020-07-31 12:58:59,Alphabet earnings - what happened and what to expect,"Howdy folks,

Like most of you, I sat on the edge of my seat after the bell yesterday waiting for the FAAG earnings.  First came FB with a massive beat, something of a surprise given the boycott.  Then another handsome beat by Amazon.

&#x200B;

Next to follow was Alphabet, with a marginal beat on revenue and decent beat on EPS.  But with YoY decline, this hit the stock and of the FAAGs it went down after hours and in today's trading.

&#x200B;

Can anyone provide further insight into what happened?

GOOG's competitor's ad revenue continued to grow at decent rates - is this a factor of their size (FB only \~11B while GOOG in the \~30B)?

&#x200B;

What do you expect going forward?

While we recover from COVID GOOG's revenue should return to normal but is there a better opportunity for growth elsewhere?

Is GOOG a one-trick pony?

I know it's not exactly, with Cloud and other some hardware services but it seems the ad-revenue drives so much of its overall rev.

&#x200B;

As I assess my heavy tech weighted portfolio:

CRWD: 43% (this seems large but stems from a pre-IPO investment which is \~1300%)

VOO: 11%

GOOG: 9%

AAPL: 7%

AMZN: 3%

I wonder if I am better looking elsewhere than GOOG in the future, and interest in hearing your thoughts on the future of GOOG.

Cheers!

Amazon (AMZN) is officially a gaming company, and that should worry industry mainstays like Nintendo (NTDOY), Microsoft (MSFT), and Sony (SNE), as well as newcomers like Google (GOOG, GOOGL).

Amazon has been providing gaming content via its online store and its mega-popular Twitch streaming platform, but on Wednesday, the company launched its first big-budget title, a free-to-play game called “Crucible.”

Amazon will follow that up with another game later this summer called “New World,” and all of that is seemingly leading to the tech titan’s launch of a cloud gaming service called Project Tempo.",9,0.69

Share Price (01/02/20): $41.41

**Earnings Date** (in two weeks): 6/30/20

&#x200B;

**Herman Miller** is an American company that produces office furniture, equipment, and home furnishings. Its signature products include the Aeron Chair, Equa Chair, Noguchi Table, Marshmallow Sofa, and the Eames Lounge Chair.

As we have seen, work-from-home has been a real trend that will continue until a vaccine arrives. Several points below support Herman Miller as a beneficiary of this trend:

· Increasing **search traffic** for Herman Miller products

· Employers providing **free money** to buy home office furniture (e.g. - $1,500 stipends)

· **Large market** of work-from-home employees to sell to with money to spend

· WFH is a potential long term trend and saves employers money

· New e-commerce and gaming initiatives at Herman Miller

· Insider buying at Herman Miller

&#x200B;

*Supporting Information & TL;DR Below:*

&#x200B;

**HERMAN MILLER SEARCH TRAFFIC HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE MARCH**

· Google Trends search traffic shows that Herman Miller searches increased 100% after March 2020 and still remain significantly higher than they were before the Coronavirus lockdowns started.

· Other searches on Google Trends that have seen a significant up-tick include “Aeron Chairs,” “Ergonomic,” “Work From Home,” and “Telecommuting.”

&#x200B;

**EMPLOYERS PAYING EMPLOYEES TO FURNISH THEIR HOME OFFICE**

· Many companies are giving employees money to spend on their home office

· Google offering employees a $1,000 allowance to spend on equipment (Alphabet has over 100,000 employees)

· Facebook giving employees a $1,000 bonus for working from home (Facebook has over 40,000 employees)

· Shopify is letting workers spend up to $1,000 on their work from home gear (Shopify has over 5,000 employees)

· Twitter recently boosted it work from home allowance to $1,000 (Twitter has over 4,000 employees)

· Slack employees get $1,500 for working from home (Slack has over 1,500 employees)

· Indeed and Chegg are providing $500 work from home stipends to employees

· While not all companies are giving a work-from-home “bonus,” many other companies are also giving their work-from-home employees additional compensation or some sort of stipend while they are working remotely.

· “In a recent AON survey of around 1,400 US-based companies, more than one-in-five (over 20%) say they are helping pay for their employees’ home-office equipment.”

· “Meanwhile, nearly a third of companies say they are reimbursing their newly remote employees for their laptops, and more than 14% are paying for their ergonomic office furniture, according to a recent survey by Mercer.”

· Search traffic for home office items has increased significantly since March suggesting that employees are using the money to furnish their home offices

· Google trends searches for “home office” and “office chairs” have doubled since March (with “office chairs” maintaining that doubling through this week)

· Searches for “office chairs” on Slickdeals were up 65% and for “desks” was up 85% since the pandemic started

&#x200B;

**LARGE MARKET (MILLIONS OF HOUSEHOLDS) WITH SPENDING POWER**

· Working from home has increased significantly since the pandemic started:

· According to GALLUP, “Sixty-two percent of employed Americans say they have worked from home during the crisis, a number that has doubled since mid-March.”

· In March, the Society for Human Resource Management found that two-thirds of US companies were “taking steps to allow employees to work from home who don’t normally do so.”

· Virtual meetings have skyrocketed this year as evidenced by Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet showing the potential rise in home office furniture purchasing

· Zoom meeting participants rose from 10 million in December ’19 to 300 million participants in April ’20 (An increase of 3,000% over five months)

· Microsoft Teams recorded up to 200 million meeting participants in April ’19 and daily active users of 75 million (Daily active users rose 70% in one month)

· Google Meet has hit over 100 million meeting participants and was adding 3 million users per day in April ’19 (Usage increased 30-fold between January and April)

· Work from home employees have disposable income to spend and are not just employees of “silicon valley tech companies.” - What were the demographics of the “average” work-from-homer before the pandemic?

· According to Global Workplace Analytics, “A typical telecommuter (in 2016) is college-educated, 45 years old or older, and earns an annual salary of $58,000 while working for a company with more than 100 employees. 75% of employees who work from home earn $65,000 per year, putting them in the 80th percentile of all employees (home or office-based).

&#x200B;

**WORKING FROM HOME IS A POTENTIAL LONG TERM TREND**

· Some companies are committing long term to work-from-home for some of their employees which increases the ROI for workers investing in their home office

· Twitter – “If our employees are in a role and situation that enables them to work form home and they want to continue to do so forever, we will make that happen,” wrote Jennifer Christie, Twitter’s VP of People, in a blog post.

· Facebook – According to Mark Zuckerberg, “We are going to be the most forward-leaning company on remote work at our scale. I think we could get to about half of the company working remotely permanently (over the next 10 years).”

· According to GALLUP, “Three in five US workers who have been doing their jobs from home during the coronavirus pandemic would prefer to continue to work remotely as much as possible, once public health restrictions are lifted.”

· According to a Gartner survey, “Nearly three in four (75% of) CFOs plan to shift at least 5% of previously on-site employees to permanently remote positions post-COVID 19”

· Many states are seeing continued rises of COVID 19 after reopening which increases the likelihood of companies continuing to have their employees work from home.

· Texas, Arizona, Kentucky, Georgia and many other states are seeing significant increases in infections and hospitalizations after reopening

· The impact of Memorial Day activity and Black Lives Matters protests are still not fully seen and could increase the risk of those states closing again.

&#x200B;

**WORK FROM HOME SAVES EMPLOYERS MONEY & INCREASES PRODUCTIVITY**

· According to research-based consulting firm Global Workplace Analytics, employers who allow their employees to work from home part-time save about $11,000 per year for each employee working remotely.

· Providing work-from-home stipends and subsidies for employees is more “tax-efficient” as employers can deduct those costs from taxes while employees generally cannot.

· Optimizing your home office increases worker productivity, satisfaction, and morale during a stressful transition from working on-site to working at home.

· “Companies are saying, ‘We want to make sure you’re both comfortable and productive,” said Danielle Lackey, chief legal officer at Motus, a workforce management company.

· “It gets old fast to be working form your couch, and setting up a home office can be expensive,” said Hailley Griffis, Head of public relations at Buffer, a software application company.

&#x200B;

**INCREASED DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER INITIATIVES AT HERMAN MILLER**

· In December 2019, Herman Miller hired Debbie Probst as their new President of Retail. She has a ton of experience with online retail as the former President of One King’s Lane. (Before that she was at Abercrombie & Fitch and Neiman Marcus.)

· Since joining in December, Debbie has been focused on building their online sales component. The timing couldn’t have been any more fortunate given the importance of online sales in a Coronavirus environment.

&#x200B;

**NEW E-SPORTS PRODUCT LINE INTRODUCED AS NEW GROWTH SEGMENT**

· Herman Miller and Logitech recently announced a new gaming focused product line targed at the e-sports market. It is estimated that a half billion people watch e-sports with the industry being valued in the billions.

· While the average gamer spend 7 hours per week, over 7% of gamers spend at least 20 hours per week playing games. Approximately 5% of gamers between the ages of 18-25 play for more than five hours at a time (the average time spent playing for this age rage is a little under 2 hours)

· For pro gamers or gamers looking to turn pro, ergonomics is important to prevent injury and strain while they are practicing for hours on end. A comfortable chair and good equipment can help performance and increase time playing without injury.

&#x200B;

**INSIDER ACTIVITY IS NET POSITIVE**

· Michael A. Volkema (Director) purchased 25,000 shares of Herman Miller in May 2020 (over $500,000 in shares). This is significantly after the time stay at home orders were initiated and after many companies were impacted by the Coronavirus.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

Herman Miller is benefiting significantly as a result of the “work from home” trend as many employers are giving their employees free money to spend on their home offices. This is evidenced by increased google searches, employer policy announcements (GOOG, FB, TWTR), spikes in teleconferencing activity, positive insider trading activity, and several additional points made above. “Work From Home” trends will sustain for the foreseeable future as COVID cases continue to rise during the summer and skyrocket during the October / November period with no vaccine in place.

2020-05-04 16:45:34,Are non-tech stocks worth investing in?,"For quite a while (probably dating back to the trade war circa 2018), it appears to be the case that the tech stocks have consistently done well.  By tech stocks, I mean not only the FAANG (+MSFT) but also stocks like NVDA, AMD, ADBE, NOW, TEAM, etc.  Meanwhile, non-tech stocks like CVX, CAT, DAL, BA (for obvious reasons) have not been doing well.  In fact, I think energy has been one of the worst sectors for the past 2 years.  Even consumer staples like CAG, TSN have stagnated.

Today was tough, stocks again traded choppily today as market volatility continued. Tech shares continued to slide after last month’s historic rally. The S&P and Dow finished slightly green, while the Nasdaq underperformed to finish firmly in the red.

The Dow led the session, finishing 0.47% up, the S&P was 0.06% up and the Nasdaq underperformed, ending the day 0.69%. Precious metals were modestly up (Gold 0.11%, Silver 0.24%), but gold miners were firmly down (GDX 1.03% down)

The Nasdaq sank 1.4%, as the index was pressured by an ongoing rout in some of their most heavily weighed big tech shares. Apple (AAPL) shares dropped 1.35% and tracked toward a weekly loss of more than 8%.
